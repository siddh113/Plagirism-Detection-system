p 3 TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. -----------------------

I CAN not more appropriately introduce the Cosmos than by presenting a brief sketch of the
life of its illustrious author.*  While the name of Alexander von Humboldt is familiar to every
one, few, perhaps, are aware of the peculiar circumstances of his scientific career and of
the extent of his labors in almost every department of physical knowledge.  He was born on
the 14th of September, 1769, and is, therefore, now in his 80th year.  After going through
the ordinary course of education at Gottingen, and having made a rapid tour through Holland,
England, and France, he became a pupil of Werner at the mining school of Freyburg, and in his
21st year published an "Essay on the Basalts of the Rhine."  Though he soon became officially
connected with the mining corps, he was enabled to continue his excursions in foreign countries,
for, during the six or seven years succeeding the publication of his first essay, he seems
to have visited Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and France.  His attention to mining did not,
however, prevent him from devoting his attention to other scientific pursuits, among which
botany and the then recent discovery of galvanism may be especially noticed.  Botany, indeed,
we know from his own authority, occupied him almost exclusively for some years; but even at
this time he was practicing the use of those astronomical and physical instruments which he
afterward turned to so singularly excellent an account.

[footnote] *For the following remarks I am mainly indebted to the articles on the Cosmos in
the two leading Quarterly Reviews.

The political disturbances of the civilized world at the close p 4 of the last century prevented
our author from carrying out various plans of foreign travel which he had contemplated, and
detained him an unwilling prisoner in Europe.  In the year 1799 he went to Spain, with the
hope of entering Africa from Cadiz, but the unexpected patronage which he received at the court
of Madrid led to a great alteration in his plans, and decided him to proceed directly to the
Spanish possessions in America, "and there gratify the longings for foreign adventure, and
the scenery of the tropics, which had haunted him from boyhood, but had all along been turned
in the diametrically opposite direction of Asia."  After encountering various risks of capture,
he succeeded in reaching America, and from 1799 to 1804 prosecuted there extensive researches
in the physical geography of the New World, which has indelibly stamped his name in the undying
records of science.

Excepting an excursion to Naples with Gay-Lussac and Von Buch in 1805 (the year after his return
from America), the succeeding twenty years of his life were spent in Paris, and were almost
exclusively employed in editing the results of his American journey.  In order to bring these
results before the world in a manner worthy of their importance, he commenced a series of gigantic
publications in almost every branch of science on which he had instituted observations.  In
1817, after twelve years of incessant toil, four fifths were completed, and an ordinary copy
of the part then in print cost considerably more than one hundred pounds sterling.  Since that
time the publication has gone on more slowly, and even now after the lapse of nearly half a
century, it remains, and probably ever will remain, incomplete.

In the year 1828, when the greatest portion of his literary labor had been accomplished, he
undertook a scientific journey to Siberia, under the special protection of the Russian government.
In this journey -- a journey for which he had prepared himself by a course of study unparalleled
in the history of travel -- he was accompanied by two companions hardly less distinguished
than himself, Ehrenberg and Gustav Rose, and p 5 the results obtained during their expedition
are recorded by our author in his 'Fragments Asiatiques', and in his 'Asie Centrale', and by
Rose in his 'Reise nach dem Oural'.  If the 'Asie Centrale' had been his only work, constituting,
as it does, an epitome of all the knowledge acquired by himself and by former travelers on
the physical geography of Northern and Central Asia, that work alone would have sufficed to
form a reputation of the highest order.

I proceed to offer a few remarks on the work of which I now present a new translation to the
English public, a work intended by its author "to embrace a summary of physical knowledge,
as connected with a delineation of the material universe."

The idea of such a physical description of the universe had, it appears,
been present to his mind from a very early epoch.  It was a work which he
felt he must accomplish, and he devoted almost a lifetime to the
accumulation of materials for it.  For almost half a century it had occupied
his thoughts; and at length, in the evening of life, he felt himself rich
enough in the accumulation of thought, travel, reading, and experimental
research, to reduce into form and reality the undefined vision that has so
long floated before him.  The work, when completed, will form three volumes.
 The 'first' volume comprises a sketch of all that is at present known of
the physical phenomena of the universe; the 'second' comprehends two
distinct parts, the first of which treats of the incitements to the study of
nature, afforded in descriptive poetry, landscape painting, and the
cultivation of exotic plants; while the second and larger part enters into
the consideration of the different epochs in the progress of discovery and
of the corresponding stages of advance in human civilization.  The 'third'
volume, the publication of which, as M. Humboldt himself informs me in a
letter addressed to my learned friend and publisher, Mr. H. G. Bohn, "has
been somewhat delayed, owing to the present state of public affairs, will
comprise the special and scientific development of the great Picture of
Nature
p 6
Each of the three parts of the 'Cosmos' is therefore, to a certain extent,
distinct in its object, and may be considered complete in itself.  We can
not better terminate this brief notice than in the words of one of the most
eminent philosophers of our own country, that, "should the conclusion
correspond (as we doubt not) with these beginnings, a work will have been
accomplished every way worthy of the author's fame, and a crowning laurel
added to that wreath with which Europe will always delight to surround the
name of Alexander von Humboldt."

In venturing to appear before the English public as the interpreter of "the great work of our
age,"* I have been encouraged by the assistance of many kind literary and scientific friends,
and I gladly avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my deep obligations to Mr. Brooke,
Dr. Day, Professor Edward Forbes, Mr. Hind, Mr. Glaisher, Dr. Percy, and Mr. Ronalds, for the
valuable aid they  have afforded me.

[footnote] *The expression applied to the Cosmos by the learned Bunsen, in his late Report
on Ethnology, in the 'Report of the British Association for' 1847, p. 265.

It would be scarcely right to conclude these remarks without a reference to the translations
that have preceded mine.  The translation executed by Mrs. Sabine is singularly accurate and
elegant.  The other translation is remarkable for the opposite qualities, and may therefore
be passed over in silence.  The present volumes differ from those of Mrs. Sabine in having
all the foreign measures converted into corresponding English terms, in being published at
considerably less than one third of the price, and in being a translation of the entire work,
for I have not conceived myself justified in omitting passages, sometimes amounting to pages,
simply because they might be deemed slightly obnoxious to our national prejudices.

p 7 AUTHOR'S PREFACE. -------------------

In the late evening of an active life I offer to the German public a work, whose undefined
image has floated before my mind for almost half a century. I have frequently looked upon its
completion as impracticable, but as often as I have been disposed to relinquish the undertaking,
I have again -- although perhaps imprudently -- resumed the task.  This work I now present
to my contemporaries with a diffidence inspired by a just mistrust of my own powers, while
I would willingly forget that writings long expected are usually received with less indulgence.

Although the outward relations of life, and an irresistible impulse toward knowledge of various
kinds, have led me to occupy myself for many years -- and apparently exclusively -- with separate
branches of science, as, for instance, with descriptive botany, geognosy, chemistry, astronomical
determinations of position, and terrestrial magnetism, in order that I might the better prepare
myself for the extensive travels in which I was desirous of engaging, the actual object of
my studies has nevertheless been of a higher character.  My intercourse with highly-gifted
men early led me to discover that, without an earnest striving to attain to a knowledge of
special branches of study, all attempts to give a grand and general view of the universe would
be nothing more than a vain illusion. These special departments in the great domain of natural
p 8 science are, moreover, capable of being reciprocally fructified by means of the appropriative
forces by which they are endowed.  Descriptive botany, no longer confined to the narrow circle
of the determination of genera and species, leads the observer who traverses distant lands
and lofty mountains to the study of the geographical distribution of plants of the earth's
surface, according to distance from the equator and vertical elevation above the sea.  It is
further necessary to investigate the laws which regulate the differences of temperature and
climate, and the meteorological processes of the atmosphere, before we can hope to explain
the involved causes of vegetable distribution; and it is thus that the observer who earnestly
pursues the path of knowledge is led from one class of phenomena to another, by means of the
mutual dependence and connection existing between them.

I have enjoyed an advantage which few scientific travelers have shared to an equal extent,
viz., that of having seen not only littoral districts, such as are alone visited by the majority
of those who take part in voyages of circumnavigation, but also those portions of the interior
of two vast continents which present the most striking contrasts manifested in the Alpine tropical
landscapes of South America, and the dreary wastes of the steppes in Northern Asia.  Travels,
undertaken in districts such as these, could not fail to encourage the natural tendency of
my mind toward a generalization of views, and to encourage me to attempt, in a special work,
to treat of the knowledge which we at present possess, regarding the sidereal and terrestrial
phenomena of the Cosmos in their empirical relations.  The hitherto undefined idea of a physical
geography has thus, by an extended and perhaps too boldly imagined a plan, been comprehended
under the idea of a physical description of the universe, embracing all created things in the
regions of space and in the earth.

The very abundance of the materials which are presented to the mind for arrangement and definition,
necessarily impart no inconsiderable difficulties in the choice of the form under p 9 which
such a work must be presented, if it would aspire to the honor of being regarded as a literary
composition.  Descriptions of nature ought not to be deficient in a tone of life-like truthfulness,
while the mere enumeration of a series of general results is productive of a no less wearying
impression than the elaborate accumulation of the individual data of observation.  I scarcely
venture to hope that I have succeeded in satisfying these various requirements of composition,
or that I have myself avoided the shoals and breakers which I have known how to indicate to
others.  My faint hope of success rests upon the special indulgence which the German public
have bestowed upon a small work bearing the title of 'Ansichten der Natur', which I published
soon after my return from Mexico. This work treats, under general points of view, of separate
branches of physical geography (such as the forms of vegetation, grassy plains, and deserts).
The effect produced by this small volume has doubtlessly been more powerfully manifested in
the influence it has exercised on the sensitive minds of the young, whose imaginative faculties
are so strongly manifested, than by means of any thing which it could itself impart.  In the
work on the Cosmos on which I am now engaged, I have endeavored to show, as in that entitled
'Ansichten der Natur', that a certain degree of scientific completeness in the treatment of
individual facts is not wholly incompatible with a picturesque animation of style. Since public
lectures seemed to me to present an easy and efficient means of testing the more or less successful
manner of connecting together the detached branches of any one science, I undertook, for many
months consecutively, first in the French language, at Paris, and afterward in my own native
German, at Berlin (almost simultaneously at two different places of assembly), to deliver a
course of lectures on the physical description of the universe, according to my conception
of the science.  My lectures were given extemporaneously, both in French and German, and without
the aid of written notes, nor have I, in any way, made use, in the present work, p 10 of those
portions of my discourses which have been preserved by the industry of certain attentive auditors.
With the exception of the first forty pages, the whole of the present work was written, for
the first time, in the years 1843 and 1844.

A character of unity, freshness, and animation must, I think, be derived from an association
with some definite epoch, where the object of the writer is to delineate the present condition
of knowledge and opinions.  Since the additions constantly made to the latter give rise to
fundamental changes in pre-existing views, my lectures and the Cosmos have nothing in common
beyond the succession in which the various facts are treated.  The first portion of my work
contains introductory considerations regarding the diversity in the degrees of enjoyment to
be derived from nature, and the knowledge of the laws by which the universe is governed; it
also considers the limitation and scientific mode of treating a physical description of the
universe, and gives a general picture of nature which contains a view of all the phenomena
comprised in the Cosmos.

This general picture of nature, which embraces within its wide scope the remotest nebulous
spots, and the revolving double stars in the regions of space, no less than the telluric phenomena
included under the department of the geography of organic forms (such as plants, animals, and
races of men), comprises all that I deem most specially important with regard to the connection
existing between generalities and specialities, while it moreover exemplifies, by the form
and style of the composition, the mode of treatment pursued in the selection of the results
obtained from experimental knowledge.  The two succeeding volumes will contain a consideration
of the particular means of incitement toward the study of nature (consisting in animated delineations,
landscape painting, and the arrangement and cultivation of exotic vegetable forms), of the
history of the contemplation of the universe, or the gradual development of the reciprocal
action of natural forces constituting one natural whole; and lastly, of the special p 11 branches
of the several departments of science, whose mutual connection is indicated in the beginning
of the work.  Wherever it has been possible to do so, I have adduced the authorities from whence
I derived my facts, with a view of affording testimony both to the accuracy of my statements
and to the value of the observations to which reference was made.  In those instances where
I have quoted from my own writings (the facts contained in which being, from their very nature,
scattered through different portions of my works), I have always referred to the original editions,
owing to the importance of accuracy with regard to numerical relations, and to my own distrust
of the care and correctness of translators.  In the few cases where I have extracted short
passages from the works of my friends, I have indicated them by marks of quotation; and, in
imitation of the practice of the ancients, I have invariably preferred the repetition of the
same words to any arbitrary substitution of my own paraphrases.  The much-contested question
of priority of claim to a first discovery, which it is so dangerous to treat of in a work of
this uncontroversial kind, has rarely been touched upon.  Where I have occasionally referred
to classical antiquity, and to that happy period of transition which has rendered the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries so celebrated, owing to the great geographical discoveries by which
the age was characterized, I have been simply led to adopt this mode of treatment, from the
desire we experience from time to time, when considering the general views of nature, to escape
from the circle of more strictly dogmatical modern opinions, and enter the free and fanciful
domain of earlier presentiments.

It has frequently been regarded as a subject of discouraging consideration, that while purely
literary products of intellectual activity are rooted in the depths of feeling, and interwoven
with the creative force of imagination, all works treating of empirical knowledge, and of the
connection of natural phenomena and physical laws, are subject to the most marked modifications
of form in the lapse of short periods of time, both p 12 by the improvement in the instruments
used, and by the consequent expansion of the field of view opened to rational observation,
and that those scientific works which have, to use a common expression, become 'antiquated'
by the acquisition of new funds of knowledge, are thus continually being consigned to oblivion
as unreadable.  However discouraging such a prospect must be, no one who is animated by a genuine
love of nature, and by a sense of the dignity attached to its study, can view with regret any
thing which promises future additions and a greater degree of perfection to general knowledge.
Many important branches of knowledge have been based upon a solid foundation which will not
easily be shaken, both as regards the phenomena in the regions of space and on the earth; while
there are other portions of science in which general views will undoubtedly take the place
of merely special; where new forces will be discovered and new substances will be made known,
and where those which are now considered as simple will be decomposed.  I would, therefore,
venture to hope that an attempt to delineate nature in all its vivid animation and exalted
grandeur, and to trace the 'stable' amid the vacillating, ever-recurring alternation of physical
metamorphoses, will not be wholly disregarded even at a future age. 'Potsdam, Nov.', 1844.

GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS.

Introduction. -- Reflections on the different Degrees of Enjoyment presented to us by the Aspect
of Nature and the scientific Exposition of the Laws of the Universe . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .Page 23-78

Insight into the connection of phenomena as the aim of all natural investigation.  Nature presents
itself to meditative contemplation as a unity in diversity.  Differences in the grades of enjoyment
yielded by nature.  Effect of contact with free nature; enjoyment derived from nature independently
of a knowledge of the action of natural forces, or of the physiognomy and configuration of
the surface, or of the character of vegetation.  Reminiscences of the woody valleys of the
Cordilleras and of the Peak of Teneriffe.  Advantages of the mountainous region near the equator,
where the multiplicity of natural impressions attains its maximum within the most circumscribed
limits, and where it is permitted to man simultaneously to behold all the stars of the firmament
and all the forms of vegetation -- p. 23-33.

Tendency toward the investigation of the causes of physical phenomena. Erroneous views of the
character of natural forces arising from an imperfect mode of observation or of induction.
The crude accumulation of physical dogmas transmitted from one country to another.  Their diffusion
among the higher classes. Scientific physics are associated with another and a deep-rooted
system of untried and misunderstood experimental positions.  Investigation of natural laws.
Apprehension that nature may lose a portion of its secret charm by an inquiry into the internal
character of its forces, and that the enjoyment of nature must necessarily be weakened by a
study of its domain.  Advantages of general views which impart an exalted and solemn character
to natural science.  The possibility of separating generalities from specialties. Examples
drawn from astronomy, recent optical discoveries, physical geognosy, and the geography of plants.
Practicability of the study of physical cosmography -- p. 33-54.  Misunderstood popular knowledge,
confounding cosmography with a mere encyclopedic enumeration of natural sciences.  Necessity
for a simultaneous regard for all branches of natural science.  Influence of this study on
national prosperity and the welfare of nations; its more earnest and characteristic aim is
an inner one, arising from exalted mental activity.  Mode of treatment with regard to the object
and presentation; reciprocal connection existing between thought and speech -- p. 54-56.

The notes to p. 28-33.  Comparative hypsometrical data of the elevations of the Dhawalagiri,
Jawahir, Chimborazo, Aetna (according to the measurement of Sir John Herschel), the Swiss Alps,
etc. -- p. 28.  Rarity p 16 of palms and ferns in the Himalaya Mountains -- p. 29.  European
vegetable forms in the Indian Mountains -- p. 30.  Northern and southern limits of perpetual
snow on the Himalaya; influence of the elevated plateau of Thibet -- p. 30-33.  Fishes of an
earlier world -- p. 46.

Limits and Method of Exposition of the Physical Description of the Universe . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . Page 56-78

Subjects embraced by the study of the Cosmos or of physical cosmography. Separation of other
kindred studies -- p. 56-62.  The uranological portion of the Cosmos is more simple than the
telluric; the impossibility of ascertaining the diversity of matter simplifies the study of
the mechanism of the heavens.  Origin of the word 'Cosmos', its signification of adornment
and order of the universe.  The 'existing' can not be absolutely separated in our contemplation
of nature from the 'future'.  History of the world and description of the world -- p. 26-73.
Attempts to embrace the multiplicity of the phenomena of the Cosmos in the unity of thought
and under the form of a purely rational combination. Natural philosophy, which preceded all
exact observation in antiquity, is a natural, but not unfrequently ill-directed, effort of
reason.  Two forms of abstraction rule in the whole mass of knowledge, viz.:  the 'quantitative',
relative determinations according to number and magnitude, and 'qualitative', material characters.
Means of submitting phenomena to calculation.  Atoms, mechanical methods of construction. 
Figurative representations; mythical conception of imponderable matters, and the peculiar vital

simplification and generalization.  Arrangement of the facts discovered in accordance with
leading ideas.  The treasure of empirical contemplation, collected through ages, is in no danger

Delineation of Nature.  General Review of Natural Phenomena. . . . . p. 79-359

Introduction -- p. 79-83.  A descriptive delineation of the world embraces
the whole universe ([Greek words]) in the celestial and terrestrial spheres.
 Form and course of the representation.  It begins with the laws of
gravitation, and with the region of the remotest nebulous spots and double
stars, and then, gradually descending through the starry stratum to which
our solar system belongs, it contemplates this terrestrial spheroid,
surrounded by air and water, and finally, proceeds to the consideration of
the form of our planet, its temperature and magnetic tension, and the
fullness of organic vitality which is unfolded on its surface under the
action of light.  Partial insight into the relative dependence existing
among all phenomena.  Amid all the mobile and unstable elements in space,
'mean numerical values' are the ultimate aim of investigation, being the
expression of the physical laws, or forces of the Cosmos.  The delineation
of the universe does not begin with the earth, from which a merely
subjective point of view might have led us to start, but rather with the
objects comprised in the regions of space.  Distribution of matter, which is
partially conglomerated into rotating
p 17
and circling heavenly bodies of very different density and magnitude, and
partly scattered as self-luminous vapor.  Review of the separate portions of
the picture of nature, for the purpose of explaining the reciprocal
connection of all phenomena.

REFLECTIONS ON THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ENJOYMENT PRESENTED TO US BY THE ASPECT OF NATURE AND
THE STUDY OF HER LAWS.

In attempting, after a long absence from my native country, to develop the
physical phenomena of the globe, and the simultaneous action of the forces
that pervade the regions of space, I experience a two-fold cause of anxiety.
 The subject before me is so inexhaustible and so varied, that I fear either
to fall into the superficiality of the encyclopedist, or to weary the mind
of my reader by aphorisms consisting of mere generalities clothed in dry and
dogmatical forms.  Undue conciseness often checks the flow of expression,
while diffuseness is alike detrimental to a clear and precise exposition of
our ideas.  Nature is a free domain, and the profound conceptions and
enjoyments she awakens within us can only be vividly delineated by thought
clothed in exalted forms of speech, worthy of bearing witness to the majesty
and greatness of the creation.

In considering the study of physical phenomena, not merely in its bearings on the material
wants of life, but in its general influence on the intellectual advancement of mankind, we
find its noblest and most important result to be a knowledge of the chain of connection, by
which all natural forces are linked together, and made mutually dependent upon each other;
and it is the perception of these relations that exalts our views and ennobles our enjoyments.
Such a result can, however, only be reaped as the fruit of observation and intellect, combined
with the spirit of the age, in which are reflected all the varied phases of thought.  He who
can trace, through by-gone times, the stream of our knowledge to its primitive source, will
learn from history how, for thousands of years, man has labored, amid the ever-recurring changes
of form, to recognize the invariability of natural laws, and has thus, by the force of mind,
gradually subdued a great portion of the physical world to his dominion.  In interrogating
the history of the past, we trace the mysterious course of ideas yielding the first glimmering
perception of the same image of p 24 a Cosmos, or harmoniously ordered whole, which, dimly
shadowed forth to the human mind in the primitive ages of the world, is now fully revealed
to the maturer intellect of mankind as the result of long and laborious observation.

Each of these epochs of the contemplation of the external world -- the earliest dawn of thought
and the advanced stage of civilization -- has its own source of enjoyment.  In the former,
this enjoyment, in accordance with the simplicity of the primitive ages, flowed from an intuitive
feeling of the order that was proclaimed by the invariable and successive reappearance of the
heavenly bodies, and by the progressive development of organized beings; while in the latter,
this sense of enjoyment springs from a definite knowledge of the phenomena of nature.  When
man began to interrogate nature, and, not content with observing, learned to evoke phenomena
under definite conditions; when once he sought to collect and record facts, in order that the
fruit of his labors might aid investigation after his own brief existence had passed away,
the 'philosophy of Nature' cast aside the vague and poetic garb in which she had been enveloped
from her origin, and, having assumed a severer aspect, she now weighs the value of observations,
and substitutes induction and reasoning for conjecture and assumption.  The dogmas of former
ages survive now only in the superstitions of the people and the prejudices of the ignorant,
or are perpetuated in a few systems, which, conscious of their weakness, shroud themselves
in a vail of mystery. We may also trace the same primitive intuitions in languages exuberant
in figurative expressions; and a few of the best chosen symbols engendered by the happy inspiration
of the earliest ages, having by degrees lost their vagueness through a better mode of interpretation,
are still preserved among our scientific terms.

Nature considered 'rationally', that is to say, submitted to the process of thought, is a unity
in diversity of phenomena; a harmony blending together all created things, however dissimilar
in form and attributes; one great whole ([Greek words]) animated by the breath of life.  The
most important result of a rational inquiry into nature is, therefore, to establish the unity
and harmony of this stupendous mass of force and matter, to determine with impartial justice
what is due to the discoveries of the past and to those of the present, and to analyze the
individual parts of natural phenomena without succumbing beneath the weight of the whole. 
Thus, and thus alone, is it permitted to man, while mindful of the high destiny p 25 of his
race, to comprehend nature, to lift the vail that shrouds her phenomena, and as it were, submit
the results of observation to the test of reason and of intellect.

In reflecting upon the different degrees of enjoyment presented to us in the contemplation
of nature, we find that the first place must be assigned to a sensation, which is wholly independent
of an intimate acquaintance with the physical phenomena presented to our view, or of the peculiar
character of the region surrounding us.  In the uniform plain bounded only by a distant horizon,
where the lowly heather, the cistus, or waving grasses, deck the soil; on the ocean shore,
where the waves, softly rippling over the beach, leave a track, green with the weeds of the
sea; every where, the mind is penetrated by the same sense of the grandeur and vast expanse
of nature, revealing to the soul, by a mysterious inspiration, the existence of laws that regulate
the forces of the universe.  Mere communion with nature, mere contact with the free air, exercise
a soothing yet strengthening influence on the wearied spirit, calm the storm of passion, and
soften the heart when shaken by sorrow to its inmost depths.  Every where, in every region
of the globe, in every stage of intellectual culture, the same sources of enjoyment are alike
vouchsafed to man.  The earnest and solemn thoughts awakened by a communion with nature intuitively
arise from a presentiment of the order and harmony pervading the whole universe, and from the
contrast we draw between the narrow limits of our own existence and the image of infinity revealed
on every side, whether we look upward to the starry vault of heaven, scan the far-stretching
plain before us, or seek to trace the dim horizon across the vast expanse of ocean.

The contemplation of the individual characteristics of the landscape, and of the conformation
of the land in any definite region of the earth, gives rise to a different source of enjoyment,
awakening impressions that are more vivid, better defined, and more congenial to certain phases
of the mind, than those of which we have already spoken.  At one time the heart is stirred
by a sense of the grandeur of the face of nature, by the strife of the elements, or, as in
Northern Asia by the aspect of the dreary barrenness of the far-stretching steppes; at another
time, softer emotions are excited by the contemplation of rich harvests wrested by the hand
of man from the wild fertility of nature, or by the sight of human habitations raised beside
some wild and foaming torrent.  Here I regard less the degree of intensity than the difference
existing in the p 26 various sensations that derive their charm and permanence from the peculiar
character of the scene.

[footnote] *This expression is taken from a beautiful description of tropical forest scenery
in 'Paul and Virginia', by Bernardia de Saint Pierre.

When far from our native country, after a long voyage, we tread for the first time the soil
of a tropical land, we experience a certain feeling of surprise and gratification in recognizing,
in the rocks that surround us, the same inclined schistose strata, and the same columnar basalt
covered with cellular amygdaloids, that we had left in Europe, and whose identity of character,
in latitudes so widely different, reminds us that the solidification of the earth's crust is
altogether independent of climatic influences.  But these rocky masses of schist and of basalt
are covered with vegetation of a character with which we are unacquainted, and of a physiognomy
wholly p 27 unknown to us; and it is then, amid the colossal and majestic forms of an exotic
flora, that we feel how wonderfully the flexibility of our nature fits us to receive new impressions,
linked together by a certain secret analogy.  We so readily perceive the affinity existing
among all the forms of organic life, that although the sight of a vegetation similar to that
of our native country might at first be most welcome to the eye, as the sweet familiar sounds
of our mother tongue are to the ear, we nevertheless, by degrees, and almost imperceptibly,
become familiarized with a new home and a new climate.  As a true citizen of the world, man
every where habituates himself to that which surrounds him; yet fearful, as it were, of breaking
the links of association that bind him to the home of his childhood, the colonist applies to
some few plants in a far-distant clime the names he had been familiar with in his native land;
and by the mysterious relations existing among all types of organization, the forms of exotic
vegetation present themselves to his mind as nobler and more perfect developments of those
he had loved in earlier days.  Thus do the spontaneous impressions of the untutored mind lead,
like the laborious deductions of cultivated intellect, to the same intimate persuasion, that
one sole and indissoluble chain binds together all nature.

It may seem a rash attempt to endeavor to separate, into its different elements, the magic
power exercised upon our minds by the physical world, since the character of the landscape,
and of every imposing scene in nature, depends so materially upon the mutual relation of the
ideas and sentiments simultaneously excited in the mind of the observer.

The powerful effect exercised by nature springs, as it were, from the connection and unity
of the impressions and emotions produced; and we can only trace their different sources by
analyzing the individuality of objects and the diversity of forces.

The richest and most varied elements for pursuing an analysis of this nature present themselves
to the eyes of the traveler in the scenery of Southern Asia, in the Great Indian Archipelago,
and more especially, too, in the New Continent, where the summits of the lofty Cordilleras
penetrate the confines of the aerial ocean surrounding our globe, and where the same subterranean
forces that once raised these mountain chains still shake them to their foundation and threaten
their downfall.

Graphic delineations of nature, arranged according to systematic views, are not only suited
to please the imagination, p 28 but may also, when properly considered, indicate the grades
of the impressions of which I have spoken, from the uniformity of the sea-shore, or the barren
steppes of Siberia, to the inexhaustible fertility of the torrid zone.  If we were even to
picture to ourselves Mount Pilatus placed on the Schreckhorn,* or the Schneekoppe of Silesia
on Mont Blanc, we should p 29 not have attained to the height of that great Colossus of the
Andes, the Chimborazo, whose height is twice that of Mont Aetna; and we must pile the Righi,
or Mount Athos, on the summit of the Chimborazo, in order to form a just estimate of the elevation
of the Dhawalagiri, the highest point of the Himalaya.

[footnote] *These comparisons are only approximative.  The several elevations above the level
of the sea are, in accurate numbers, as follows: The Schneekoppe or Riesenkoppe, in Silesia
about 5270 feet, according to Hallaschka.  The Righi, 5902 feet, taking the height of the Lake
of Lucerne at 1426 feet, according to Eschman.  (See 'Compte Rendu des Mesures Trigonometriques
en Suisse', 1840, p. 230.)  Mount Athos, 6775 feet, according to Captain Gaultier; Mount Pilatus,
7546 feet; Mount Aetna, 10,871 feet, according to Captain Smyth; or 10,874 feet, according
to the barometrical measurement made by Sir John Herschel, and communicated to me in writing
in 1825, and 10,899 feet, according to angles of altitude taken by Cacciatore at Palermo (calculated
by assuming the terrestrial refraction to be 0.076); the Schreckhorn, 12,383 feet; the Jungfrau,
13,720 feet, according to Tralles; Mount Blanc, 15,775 feet, according to the different measurements
considered by Roger ('Bibl. Univ.', May, 1828, 0. 24-53), 15,733 feet, according to the measurements
taken from Mount Columbier by Carlini in 1821, and 15,748 feet, as measured by the Austrian
engineers from Trelod and the Glacier d'Ambin.

[footnote continued] The actual height of the Swiss mountains fluctuates, according to Eschman's
observations, as much as 25 English feet, owing to the varying thickness of the stratum of
snow that covers the summits.  Chimborazo is, according to my trigonometrical measurements,
21,421 feet (see Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Obs. Astr.', tome i., p. 73), and Dhawalagiri, 28,074
feet.  As there is a difference of 445 feet between the determinations of Blake and Webb, the
elevation assigned to the Dhawalagiri (or white mountain, from the Sanscrit 'dhawala', white,
and 'giri', mountain) can not be received with the same confidence as that of the Jawahir,
25,749 feet, since the latter rests on a complete trigonomietrical measurement (see Herbert
and Hodgson in the 'Asiat. Res.', vol. xiv., p. 189, and Suppl. to 'Encycl. Brit.', vol. iv.,
p. 643).  I have shown elsewhere ('Ann. des Sciences Naturelles', Mars, 1825) that the height
of the Dhawalagiri (28,074 feet) depends on several elements that have not been ascertained
with certainty, as azimuths and latitudes (Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 282).  It
has been believed, but without foundation, that in the Tartaric chain, north of Thibet, opposite
to the chain of Kuen-lun, there are several snowy summits, whose elevation is about 30,000
English feet (almost twice that of Mont Blanc), or, at any rate, 29,000 feet (see Captain Alexander
Gerard's and John Gerard's 'Journey to the Boorendo Pass', 1840, vol. i., p. 143 and 311).
Chimborazo is spoken of in the text only as 'one' of the highest summits of the chain of the
Andes; for in the year 1827, the learned and highly-gifted traveler, Pentland, in his memorable
expedition to Upper Peru (Bolivia), measured the elevation of two mountains situated to the
east of Lake Titicaca, viz., the Sorata, 25,200 feet, and the Illimani, 24,000 feet, both greatly
exceeding the height of Chimborazo, which is only 21,421 feet, and being nearly equal in elevation
to the Jawahir, which is the highest mountain in the Himalaya that has as yet been accurately
measured.  Thus Mont Blanc is 5646 feet below Chimborazo; Chimborazo, 3779 feet below the Sorata;
the Sorata, 549 feet below the Jawahir, and probably about 2880 feet below the Dhawalagiri.
According to a new measurement of the Illimani, by Pentland, in 1838, the elevation of this
mountain is given at 23,868 feet, varying only 133 feet from the measurement taken in 1827.
The elevations have been given in this note with minute exactness, as erroneous numbers have
been introduced into many maps and tables recently published, owing to incorrect reductions
of the measurements. [In the preceding note, taken from those appended to the Introduction
in the French translation, rewritten by Humboldt himself, the measurements are given in meters,
but these have been converted into English feet, for the greater convenience of the general
reader.] -- 'Tr.'

But although the mountains of India greatly surpass the Cordilleras of South America by their
astonishing elevation (which, after being long contested, has at last been confirmed by accurate
measurements), they can not, from their geographical position, present the same inexhaustible
variety of phenomena by which the latter are characterized.  The impression produced by the
grander aspects of nature dies not depend exclusively on height.  The chain of the Himalaya
is placed far beyond the limits of the torrid zone, and scarcely is a solitary palm-tree to
be found in the beautiful valleys of Kumaoun and Garhwal.*

[Footnote] *The absence of palms and tree-ferns on the temperate slopes of the Himalaya is
shown in Don's 'Flora Nepalensis', 1825, and in the remarkable series of lithographs of Wallich's
'Flora Indica', whose catalogue contains the enormous number of 7683 Himalaya species, almost
all phanerogamic plants, which have as yet been but imperfectly classified.  In Nepaul (lat.
26 1/2 degrees to 27 1/4 degrees) there has hitherto been observed only one species of palm,
Chamaerops martiana, Wall. ('Plantae Asiat.', lib. iii., p. 5,211), which is found at the height
of 5250 English feet above the level of the sea, in the shady valley of Bunipa.  The magnificent
tree-fern, Alsophila brunoniana, Wall. (of which a stem 48 feet long has been in the possession
of the British Museum since 1831), does not grow in Nepaul, but is found on the mountains of
Silhet, to the northwest of Calcutta, in lat. 24 degrees 50 minutes.  The Nepaul fern, Paranema
cyathoides, Don, formerly known as Sphaeroptera barbata, Wall. ('Plantae Asiat.', lib. i.,
p. 42, 48), is indeed, nearly related to Cyathea, a species of which I have seen in the South
American Missions of Caripe, measuring 33 feet in height; this is not, however, properly speaking
a tree.

On the southern slope of the ancient Paropamisus, in the latitudes of 28 degrees and 34 degrees,
nature no longer displays the same abundance of tree-ferns and arborescent grasses, heliconias
and orchideous plants, which in tropical p 30 regions are to be found even on the highest plateaux
of the mountains.  On the slope of the Himalaya, under the shade of the Deodora and the broad-leaved
oak, peculiar to these Indian Alps, the rocks of granite and of mica schist are covered with
vegetable forms almost similar to those which characterize Europe and Northern Asia.  The species
are not identical, but closely analogous in aspect and physiognomy, as, marsh parnassia, and
the prickly species of Ribes.*  The chain of the Himalaya is also wanting in the imposing phenomena
of volcanoes, which in the Andes and in the Indian Archipelago often reveal to the inhabitants,
under the most terrific forms, the existence of the forces pervading the interior of our planet.

[footnote]  *Ribes nubicola, R. glaciale, R. grossularia.  The species which compose the vegetation
of the Himalaya are four pines, notwithstanding the assertion of the ancients regarding Eastern
Asia (Strabo, lib. 11, p. 510, Cas.), twenty-five oaks, four birches, two chestnuts, seven
maples, twelve willows, fourteen roses, three species of strawberry, seven species of Alpine
roses ('rhododendra'), one of which attains a height of 20 feet, and many other northern genera.
Large white apes, having black faces, inhabit the wild chestnut-tree of Kashmir, which grows
to a height of 100 feet, in lat. 33 degrees (see Carl von Hugel's 'Kaschmir', 1840, 2d pt.
249).  Among the Coniferae, we find the Pinus deodwara, or deodara (in Sanscrit, 'dewa-daru',
the timber of the gods), which is nearly allied to Pinus cedrus.  Near the limit of perpetual
snow flourish the large and showy flowers of the Gentiana venusta, G. Moorcroftiana, Swertia
purpurescens, S. speciosa, Parnassia armata, P. nubicola, Poenia Emode, Tulipa stellata; and
besides varieties of European genera peculiar to these Indian mountains, true European species
as Leontodon taraxacum, Prunella vulgaris, Galium aparine, and Thlaspi arvense.  The heath
mentioned by Saunders, in Turner's 'Travels', and which had been confounded with Calluna vulgaris,
is an Andromeda, a fact of the greatest importance in the geography of Asiatic plants.  If
I have made use, in this work, of the unphilosophical expressions of European genera, 'European'
special, 'growing wild in Asia', etc., it has been in consequence of the old botanical language,
which, instead of the idea of a large dissemination, or, rather, of the coexistence of organic
productions, has dogmatically substituted the false hypothesis of a migration, which, from
predilection for Europe, is further assumed to have been from west to east.

Moreover, on the southern declivity of the Himalaya, where the ascending current deposits the
exhalations rising from a vigorous Indian vegetation, the region of perpetual snow begins at
an elevation of 11,000 or 12,000 feet above the level of the sea,* thus setting a limit to
the development of organic p 31 life in a zone that is nearly 3000 feet lower than that to
which it attains in the equinoctial region of the Cordilleras.

[footnote] *On the southern declivity of the Himalaya, the limit of
perpetual snow is 12,978 feet above the level of the sea; on the northern
declivity, or, rather, on the peaks which rise above the Thibet, or
Tartarian plateau, this limit is at 16,625 feet from 30 1/2 degrees to 32
degrees of latitude, while at the equator, in the Andes of Quito, it is
15,790 feet.  Such is the result I have deduced from the combination of
numerous data furnished by Webb, Gerard, Herbert, and Moorcroft.  (See my
two memoirs on the mountains of India, in 1816 and 1820, in the 'Ann. de
Chimie et de Physique', t. iii., p. 303; t. xiv., p. 6, 22, 50.)  The
greater elevation to which the limit of perpetual snow recedes on the
Tartarian declivity is owing to the radiation of heat from the neighboring
elevated plains, to the purity of the atmosphere, and to the infrequent
formation of snow in an air which is both very cold and very dry.
(Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 281-326.)  My opinion on the
difference of height of the snow-line on the two sides of the Himalaya has
the high authority of Colebrooke in its favor.  He wrote to me in June,
1824, as follows:  "I also find, from the data in my possession, that the
elevation of the line of perpetual snow is 13,000 feet.  On the southern
declivity, and at latitude 31 degrees, Webb's measurements give me 13,500
feet, consequently 500 feet more than the height deduced from Captain
Hodgson's observations.  Gerard's measurements fully confirm your opinion
that the line of snow is higher on the northern than on the southern side."
It was not until the present year (1840) that we obtained the complete and
collected journal of the brothers Gerard, published under the supervision of
Mr. Lloyd.  ('Narrative of a Journey from Cawnpoor to the Boorendo Pass, in
the Himalaya, by Captain Alexander Gerard and John Gerard, edited by George
Lloyd', vol. i., p. 292, 311, 320, 327 and 341.)  Many interesting details
regarding some localities may be found in the narrative of 'A Visit to the
Shatool, for the Purpose of determining the Line of Perpetual Snow on the
southern face of the Himalaya, in August', 1822.  Unfortunately, however,
these travelers always confound the elevation at which sporadic snow falls
with the maximum of the height that the snow-line attains on the Thibetian
plateau.  Captain Gerard distinguishes between the summits that rise in the
middle of the plateau, where he states the elevation of the snow-line to be
between 18,000 and 19,000 feet, and the northern slopes of the chain of the
Himalaya, which border on the defile of the Sutledge, and can radiate but
little heat, owing to the deep ravines with which they are intersected.  The
elevation of the village of Tangno is given at only 9300 feet, while that of
the plateau surrounding the sacred lake of Maqasa is 17,000 feet.  Captain
Gerard finds the snow-line 500 feet lower on the northern slopes, where the
chain of the Himalaya is broken through, than toward the southern
declivities facing Hindostan, and he there estimates the line of perpetual
snow at 15,000 feet.  The most striking differences are presented between
the vegetation on the Thibetian plateau and that characteristic of the
southern slopes of the Himalaya.  On the latter the cultivation of grain is
arrested at 9974 feet and even there the corn has often to be cut when the
blades are still green.  The extreme limit of forests of tall oaks and
deodars is 11,960 feet; that of dwarf birches, 12,983 feet.  On the plains,
Captain Gerard found pastures up to the height of 17,000 feet; the cereals
will grow at 14,100 feet, or even at 18,540 feet; birches with tall stems at
14,100 feet, and copse or brush wood applicable for fuel is found at an
elevation of upward of 17,000 feet, that is to say, 1280 feet and above the
lower limits of the snow-line at the equator, in the province of Quito.  It
is very desirable that the 'mean' elevation of the Thibetian plateau, which
I have estimated at only about 8200 feet between the Himalaya and the
Kuen-lun, and the difference in the height of the line of perpetual snow on
the southern and on the northern slopes of the Himalaya, should be again
investigated by travelers who are accustomed to judge of the general
conformation of the land.  Hitherto simple calculations have too often been
confounded with actual measurements, and the elevations of isolated summits
with that of the surrounding plateau.  (Compare Carl Zimmerman's excellent
Hypsometrical Remarks in his 'Geographischen Analyse der Karte von Inner
Asien', 1841, s. 98.)  Lord draws attention to the difference presented by
the two faces of the Himalaya and those of the Alpine chain of Hindoo-Coosh,
with respect to the limits of the snow-line.  "The latter chain," he says,
"has the table-land to the south, in consequence of which the snow-line is
higher on the southern side, contrary to what we find to be the case with
respect to the Himalaya, which is bounded on the south by sheltered plains,
as Hindoo-Coosh is on the north."  It must, however, be admitted that the
hypsometrical data on which these statements are based require a critical
revision with regard to several of their details; but still they suffice to
establish the main fact, that the remarkable configuration of the land in
Central Asia affords man all that is essential to the maintenance of life,
as habitation, food, and fuel, at an elevation above the level of the sea
which in almost all other parts of the globe is covered with perpetual ice.
We must except the very dry districts of Bolivia, where snow is so rarely
met with, and where Pentland (in 1838) fixed the snow-line at 15,667 feet,
between 16 degrees and 17 3/4 degrees south latitude.  The opinion that I
had advanced regarding the difference in the snow-line on the two faces of
the Himalaya has been most fully confirmed by the barometrical observations
of Victor Jacquemont, who fell an early sacrifice to his noble and unwearied
ardor.  (See his 'Correspondance pendant son Voyage dans l'Inde', 1828 'a'
1832, liv. 23, p. 290, 296, 299.)  "Perpetual snow," says Jacquemont,
"descends lower on the southern than on the northern slopes of the Himalaya,
and the limit constantly rises as we advance to the north of the chain
bordering on India.  On the Kionbrong, about 18,317 feet in elevation,
according to Captain Gerard, I was still considerably below the limit of
perpetual snow which I believe to be 19,690 feet in this part of Hindostan."
 (This estimate I consider much too high.)

[Footnote continues]  The same traveler says, "To whatever height we rise on the southern declivity
of the Himalaya, the climate retains the same character, and the same division of the seasons
as in the plains of India; the summer solstice being every year marked by the same prevalence
of rain which continues to fall without intermission until the autumnal equinox. But a new,
a totally different climate begins at Kashmir, whose elevation I estimate to be 5350 feet,
nearly equal to that of the cities of Mexico and Popayan" ('Correspond. de Jacquemont', t.
ii., p. 58 et 74).  The warm and humid air of the sea, as Leopold von Buch well observes, is
carried by the monsoons across the plains of India to the skirts of the Himalaya which arrest
its course, and hinder it from diverging to the Thibetian districts of Ladak and Lassa.  Carl
von Hugel estimates the elevation of the Valley of Kashmir above the level of the sea at 5818
feet, and bases his observation on the determination of the boiling point of water (see theil
11, s. 155, and 'Journal of Geog. Soc.', vol. vi., p. 215).  In this valley, where the atmosphere
is scarcely ever agitated by storms, and in 34 degrees 7 minutes lat., snow is found, several
feet in thickness, from December to March.

p 32 But the countries bordering on the equator possess another advantage, to which sufficient
attention has not hitherto been p 33 directed.  This portion of the surface of the globe affords
in the smallest space the greatest possible variety of impressions from the contemplation of
nature.  Among the colossal mountains of Cundinamarea, of Quito, and of Peru, furrowed by deep
ravines, man is enabled to contemplate alike all the families of plants, and all the stars
of the firmament.  There, at a single glance, the eye surveys majestic palms, humid forests
of bambusa, and the varied species of Musaceae, while above these forms of tropical vegetation
appear oaks, medlars, the sweet-brier, and umbelliferous plants, as in our European homes.
There as the traveler turns his eyes to the vault of heaven, a single glance embraces the constellation
of the Southern Cross, the Magellanic clouds, and the guiding stars of the constellation of
the Bear, as they circle round the arctic pole.  There the depths of the earth and the vaults
of heaven display all the richness of their forms and the variety of their phenomena.  There
the different climates are ranged the one above the other, stage by stage, like the vegetable
zones, whose succession they limit; and there the observer may readily trace the laws that
regulate the diminution of heat, as they stand indelibly inscribed on the rocky walls and abrupt
declivities of the Cordilleras.

Not to weary the reader with the details of the phenomena which I long since endeavored graphically
to represent,* I will here limit myself to the consideration of a few of the general results
whose combination constitutes the 'physical delineation of the torrid zone.'  That which, in
the vagueness of our p 34 impressions, loses all distinctness of form, like some distant mountain
shrouded from view by a vail of mist, is clearly revealed by the light of mind, which, by its
scrutiny into the causes of phenomena, learns to resolve and analyze their different elements,
assigning to each its individual character.  Thus, in the sphere of natural investigation,
as in poetry and painting, the delineation of that which appeals most strongly to the imagination,
derives its collective interest from the vivid truthfulness with which the individual features
are portrayed.

[footnote]  *See, generally my 'Essai sur la Geographie des Plantes, et le Tableau physique
des Regions Equinoxiales', 1807, p. 80-88.  On the diurnal and nocturnal variations of temperature,
see Plate 9 of my 'Atlas Geogr. et Phys. du Nouveau Continent'; and the Tables in my work,
entitled 'De distributione Geographica Plantarum, secundum coeli tempriem, et altitudinem Montium',
1817, p. 90-116; the meteorological portion of my 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 212, 224; and,
finally, the more recent and far more exact exposition of the variations of temperature experienced
in correspondence with the increase of altitude on the chain of the Andes, given in Boussingault's
Memoir, 'Sur la profondeur a laquelle on trouve, sous les Tropiques, la couche de Temperature
Invariable.'  (Ann. de Chimie et de Physique, 1833, t. liii., p. 225-247.)  This treatise contains
the elevations of 128 points, included between the level of the sea and the declivity of the
Antisana (17,900 feet), as well as the mean temperature of the atmosphere, which varies with
the height between 81 degrees and 35 degrees F.

The regions of the torrid zone not only give rise to the most powerful impressions by their
organic richness and their abundant fertility, but they likewise afford the inestimable advantage
of revealing to man, by the uniformity of the variations of the atmosphere and the development
of vital forces, and by the contrasts of climate and vegetation exhibited at the different
elevations, the invariability of the laws that regulate the course of the heavenly bodies,
reflected, as it were, in terrestrial phenomena. Let us dwell, then, for a few moments, on
the proofs of this regularity, which is such that it may be submitted to numerical calculation
and computation.

In the burning plains that rise but little above the level of the sea, reign
the families of the banana, the cycas, and the palm, of which the number of
species comprised in the flora of tropical regions has been so wonderfully
increased in the present day by the zeal of botanical travelers.  To these
groups succeed, in the Alpine valleys, and the humid and shaded clefts on
the slopes of the Cordilleras, the tree-ferns, whose thick cylindrical
trunks and delicate lace-like foliage stand out in bold relief against the
azure of the sky, and the cinchona, from which we derive the febrifuge bark.
 The medicinal strength of this bark is said to increase in proportion to
the degree of moisture imparted to the foliage of the tree by the light
mists which form the upper surface of the clouds resting over the plains.
Every where around, the confines of the forest are encircled by broad bands
of social plants, as the delicate aralia, the thibaudia, and the
myrtle-leaved Andromeda, while the Alpine rose, the magnificent befaria,
weaves a purple girdle round the spiry peaks.  In the cold regions of the
Paramos, which is continually exposed to the fury of storms and winds, we
find that flowering shrubs and herbaceous plants, bearing large and
variegated blossoms, have given place to monocotyledons, whose slender
spikes constitute the sole covering of the soil.  This is the zone of the
p 35
grasses, one vast savannah extending over the immense mountain plateaux, and
reflecting a yellow, almost golden tinge, to the slopes of the Cordilleras,
on which graze the lama and the cattle domesticated by the European
colonist.  Where the naked trachyte rock pierces the grassy turf, and
penetrates into those higher strata of air which are supposed to be less
charged with carbonic acid, we meet only with plants of an inferior
organization, as lichens, lecideas, and the brightly-colored, dust-like
lepraria, scattered around in circular patches.  Islets of fresh-fallen
snow, varying in form and extent, arrest the last feeble traces of vegetable
development, and to these succeeds the region of perpetual snow, whose
elevation undergoes but little change, and may be easily determined.  It is
but rarely that the elastic forces at work within the interior of our globe
have succeeded in breaking through the spiral domes, which, resplendent in
the brightness of eternal snow, crown the summits of the Cordilleras; and
even where these subterranean forces have opened a permanent communication
with the atmosphere, through circular craters or long fissures, they rarely
send forth currents of lava, but merely eject ignited scoriae, steam,
sulphureted hydrogen gas, and jets of carbonic acid.

In the earliest stages of civilization, the grand and imposing spectacle presented to the minds
of the inhabitants of the tropics could only awaken feelings of astonishment and awe.  It might,
perhaps, be supposed, as we have already said, that the periodical return of the same phenomena,
and the uniform manner in which they arrange themselves in successive groups, would have enabled
man more readily to attain to a knowledge of the laws of nature; but, as far as tradition and
history guide us, we do not find that any application was made of the advantages presented
by these favored regions.  Recent researches have rendered it very doubtful whether the primitive
seat of Hindoo civilization -- one of the most remarkable phases in the progress of mankind
-- was actually within the tropics.  Airyana Vaedjo, the ancient cradle of the Zend, was situated
to the northwest of the upper Indus, and after the great religious schism, that is to say,
after the separation of the Iranians from the Brahminical institution, the language that had
previously been common to them and to the Hindoos assumed among the latter people (together
with the literature, habits, and conditions of society) an individual form in the Magodha of
Madhya Desa,* a district that is bounded by the great chain p 36 of Himalaya and the smaller
range of the Vindhya.

[footnote] *See, on the Madhjadeca, properly so called, Lassen's excellent work, entitled 'Indische
Alterthumskunde', bd. i., s. 92.  The Chinese give the name of Mo-kie-thi to the southern Bahar,
situated to the south of the Ganges (see 'Foe-Koue-Ki' by, 'Chy-Fa-Hian', 1836, p. 256).  Djambu-dwipa
is the name given to the whole of India; but the words also indicate one of the four Buddhist
continents.

In less ancient times the Sanscrit language and civilization advanced toward the southeast,
penetrating further within the torrid zone, as my brother Wilhelm von Humboldt has shown in
his great work on the Kavi and other languages of analogous structure.*

[Footnote] *'Ueber die Kawi Sprache auf der Insel Java, nebst einer Einleitung uber die Verschiedenheit
des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Ein fluss auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengrshlecht's'

Notwithstanding the obstacles opposed in northern latitudes to the discovery of the laws of
nature, owing to the excessive complication of phenomena, and the perpetual local variations
and the distribution of organic forms, it is to the inhabitants of a small section of the temperate
zone that the rest of mankind owe the earliest revelation of an intimate and rational acquaintance
with the forces governing the physical world.  Moreover, it is from the same zone (which is
apparently more favorable to the progress of reason, the softening of manners, and the security
of public liberty) that the germs of civilization have been carried to the regions of the tropics,
as much by the migratory movement of races as by the establishment of colonies, differing widely
in their institution from those of the Phoenicians or Greeks.

In speaking of the influence exercised by the succession of phenomena on the greater or lesser
facility of recognizing the causes producing them, I have touched upon that important stage
of our communion with the external world, when the enjoyment arising from a knowledge of the
laws, and the mutual connection of phenomena, associates itself with the charm of a simple
contemplation of nature.  That which for a long time remains merely an object of vague intuition,
by degrees acquires the certainty of positive truth; and man, as an immortal poet has said,
in our own tongue -- Amid ceaseless change seeks the unchanging pole.*

[Footnote]  *This verse occurs in a poem of Schiller, entitled 'Der Spaziergang' which first
appeared in 1795, in the 'Horen.'

In order to trace to its primitive source the enjoyment derived from the exercise of thought,
it is sufficient to cast a rapid glance on the earliest dawnings of the philosophy of nature,
or of the ancient doctrine of the 'Cosmos.'  We find even p 37 among the most savage nations
(as my own travels enable me to attest) a certain vague, terror-stricken sense of the all-powerful
unity of natural forces, and of the existence of an invisible, spiritual essence manifested
in these forces, whether in unfolding the flower and maturing the fruit of the nutrient tree,
in upheaving the soil of the forest, or in rending the clouds with the might of the storm.
We may here trace the revelation of a bond of union, linking together the visible world and
that higher spiritual world which escapes the grasp of the senses.  The two become unconsciously
blended together, developing in the mind of man, as a simple product of ideal conception and
independently of the aid of observation, the first germ of a 'Philosophy of Nature.'

Among nations least advanced in civilization, the imagination revels in strange and fantastic
creations, and, by its predilection for symbols, alike influences ideas and language.  Instead
of examining, men are led to conjecture, dogmatize, and interpret supposed facts that have
never been observed.  The inner world of thought and of feeling does not reflect the image
of the external world in its primitive purity.  That which in some regions of the earth manifested
itself as the rudiments of natural philosophy, only to a small number of persons endowed with
superior intelligence, appears in other regions, and among entire races of men, to be the result
of mystic tendencies and instinctive intuitions.  An intimate communion with nature, and the
vivid and deep emotions thus awakened, are likewise the source from which have sprung the first
impulses toward the worship and deification of the destroying and preserving forces of the
universe.  But by degrees, as man, after having passed through the different gradations of
intellectual development, arrives at the free enjoyment of the regulating power of reflection,
and learns by gradual progress, as it were, to separate the world of ideas from that of sensations,
he no longer rests satisfied merely with a vague presentiment of the harmonious unity of natural
forces; thought begins to fulfill its noble mission; and observation, aided by reason, endeavors
to trace phenomena to the causes from which they spring.

The history of science teaches us the difficulties that have opposed the progress of this active
spirit of inquiry.  Inaccurate and imperfect observations have led, by false inductions, to
the great number of physical views that have been perpetuated as popular prejudices among all
classes of society.  Thus by the side of a solid and scientific knowledge of natural phenomena
there has been preserved a system of the pretended p 38 results of observation, which is so
much the more difficult to shake, as it denies the validity of the facts by which it may be
refuted.  This empiricism, the melancholy heritage transmitted to us from former times, invariably
contends for the truth of its axioms with the arrogance of a narrow-minded spirit.  Physical
philosophy, on the other hand, when based upon science, doubts because it seeks to investigate,
distinguishes between that which is certain and that which is merely probable, and strives
incessantly to perfect theory by extending the circle of observation.

This assemblage of imperfect dogmas, bequeathed by one age to another -- this physical philosophy,
which is composed of popular prejudices -- is not only injurious because it perpetuates error
with the obstinacy engendered by the evidence of ill-observed facts, but also because it hinders
the mind from attaining to higher views of nature.  Instead of seeking to discover the 'mean'
or 'medium' point, around which oscillate, in apparent independence of forces, all the phenomena
of the external world, this system delights in multiplying exceptions to the law, and seeks,
amid phenomena and in organic forms for something beyond the marvel of a regular succession,
and an internal and progressive development.  Ever inclined to believe that the order of nature
is disturbed, it refuses to recognize in the present any analogy with the past, and guided
by its own varying hypotheses, seeks at hazard, either in the interior of the globe or in the
regions of space, for the cause of these pretended perturbations.

It is the special object of the present work to combat those errors which
derive their source from a vicious empiricism and from imperfect inductions.
 The higher enjoyments yielded by the study of nature depend upon the
correctness and the depth of our views, and upon the extent of the subjects
that may be comprehended in a single glance.  Increased mental cultivation
has given rise, in all classes of society, to an increased desire of
embellishing life by augmenting the mass of ideas, and by multiplying means
for their generalization; and this sentiment fully refutes the vague
accusations advanced against the age in which we live, showing that other
interests, besides the material wants of life, occupy the minds of men.

It is almost with reluctance that I am about to speak of a sentiment, which appears to arise
from narrow-minded views, or from a certain weak and morbid sentimentality -- I allude to the
'fear' entertained by some persons, that nature may by degrees lose a portion of the charm
and magic of her power, p 39 as we learn more and more how to unvail her secrets, comprehend
the mechanism of the movements of the heavenly bodies, and estimate numerically the intensity
of natural forces.  It is true that, properly speaking, the forces of nature can only exercise
a magical power over us as long as their action is shrouded in mystery and darkness, and does
not admit of being classed among the conditions with which experience has made us acquainted.
The effect of such a power is, therefore, to excite the imagination, but that, assuredly, is
not the faculty of mind we would evoke to preside over the laborious and elaborate observations
by which we strive to attain to a knowledge of the greatness and excellence of the laws of
the universe.

The astronomer who, by the aid of the heliometer or a double-refracting prism,* determines
the diameter of planetary bodies; who measures patiently year after year, the meridian altitude
and the relative distances of stars, or who seeks a telescopic comet in a group of nebulae,
does not feel his imagination more excited -- and this is the very guarantee of the precision
of his labors -- than the botanist who counts the divisions of the calyx, or the number of
stamens in a flower, or examines the connected or the separate teeth of the peristoma surrounding
the capsule of a moss.  Yet the multiplied angular measurements on the one hand, and the detail
of organic relations on the other, alike aid in preparing the way for the attainment of higher
views of the laws of the universe.

[Footnote]  *Arago's ocular micrometer, a happy improvement upon Rochon's prismatic or double-refraction
micrometer.  See M. Mathieu's note in Delambre's 'Histoire de l'Astronomie au dix-huitieme
Siecle', 1827.

We must not confound the disposition of mind in the observer at the time he is pursuing his
labors, with the ulterior greatness of the views resulting from investigation and the exercise
of thought.  The physical philosopher measures with admirable sagacity the waves of light of
unequal length which by interference mutually strengthen or destroy each other, even with respect
to their chemical actions; the astronomer, armed with powerful telescopes, penetrates the regions
of space, contemplates, on the extremest confines of our solar system, the satellites of Uranus,
or decomposes faintly sparkling points into double stars differing in color.  The botanist
discovers the constancy of the gyratory motion of the chara in the greater number of vegetable
cells, and recognizes in the genera and natural families of plants the intimate relations or
organic forms.  The vault of heaven, studded with nebulae p 40 and stars, and the rich vegetable
mantle that covers the soil in the climate of palms, can not surely fail to produce on the
minds of these laborious observers of nature an impression more imposing and more worthy of
the majesty of creation than on those who are unaccustomed to investigate the great mutual
relations of phenomena.  I can not, therefore, agree with Burke when he says, "it is our ignorance
of natural things that causes all our admiration and chiefly excites our passions."

While the illusion of the senses would make the stars stationary in the vault of heaven, Astronomy,
by her aspiring labors, has assigned indefinite bounds to space; and if she have set limits
to the great nebula to which our solar system belongs, it has only been to show us in those
remote regions of our optic powers, islet on islet of scattered nebulae.  The feeling of the
sublime, so far as it arises from a contemplation of the distance of the stars, of their greatness
and physical extent, reflects itself in the feeling of the infinite, which belongs to another
sphere of ideas included in the domain of mind.  The solemn and imposing impressions excited
by this sentiment are owing to the combination of which we have spoken, and to the analogous
character of the enjoyment and emotions awakened in us, whether we float on the surface of
the great deep, stand on some lonely mountain summit enveloped in the half-transparent vapory
vail of the atmosphere, or by the aid of powerful optical instruments scan the regions of space,
and see the remote nebulous mass resolve itself into worlds of stars.

The mere accumulation of unconnected observations of details, devoid of generalization of ideas,
may doubtlessly have tended to create and foster the deeply-rooted prejudice, that the study
of the exact sciences must necessarily chill the feelings, and diminish the nobler enjoyments
attendant upon a contemplation of nature.  Those who still cherish such erroneous views in
the present age, and amid the progress of public opinion, and the advancement of all branches
of knowledge, fail in duly appreciating the value of every enlargement of the sphere of intellect,
and the importance of the detail of isolated facts in leading us on to general results.  The
fear of sacrificing the free enjoyment of nature, under the influence of scientific reasoning,
is often associated with an apprehension that every mind may not be capable of grasping the
truths of the philosophy of nature. It is certainly true that in the midst of the universal
fluctuation of phenomena and vital p 41 forces -- in that inextricable net-work of organisms
by turns developed and destroyed -- each step that we make in the more intimate knowledge of
nature leads us to the entrance of new labyrinths; but the excitement produced by a presentiment
of discovery, the vague intuition of the mysteries to be unfolded, and the multiplicity of
the paths before us, all tend to stimulate the exercise of thought in every stage of knowledge.
The discovery of each separate law of nature leads to the establishment of some other more
general law, or at least indicates to the intelligent observer its existence. Nature, as a
celebrated physiologist* has defined it, and as the word was interpreted by the Greeks and
Romans, is "that which is ever growing and ever unfolding itself in new forms."

[Footnote] *Carus, 'Von den Urtheilen des Knochen und Schalen Gerustes', 1828 6.

The series of organic types becomes extended or perfected in proportion as hitherto unknown
regions are laid open to our view by the labors and researches of travelers and observers;
as living organisms are compared with those which have disappeared in the great revolutions
of our planet; and as microscopes are made more perfect, and are more extensively and efficiently
employed.  In the midst of this immense variety, and this periodic transformation of animal
and vegetable productions, we see incessantly revealed the primordial mystery of all organic
development, that same great problem of 'metamorphosis' which Gthe has treated with more than
common sagacity, and to the solution of which man is urged by his desire of reducing vital
forms to the smallest number of fundamental types.  As men contemplate the riches of nature,
and see the mass of observations incessantly increasing before them, they become impressed
with the intimate conviction that the surface and the interior of the earth, the depths of
the ocean, and the regions of air will still, when thousands and thousands of years have passed
away, open to the scientific observer untrodden paths of discovery.  The regret of Alexander
can not be applied to the progress of observation and intelligence.*

[footnote] * Plut., in 'Vita Alex. Magni', cap. 7

General considerations, whether they treat of the agglomeration of matter in the heavenly bodies,
or of the geographical distribution of terrestrial organisms, are not only in themselves more
attractive than special studies, but they also afford superior advantages to those who are
unable to devote much time to occupations of this nature.  The different branches of the study
of natural history are only accessible in certain positions of social life, and do not, at
every season p 42 and in every climate, present like enjoyments.  Thus, in the dreary regions
of the north, man is deprived for a long period of the year of the spectacle presented by the
activity of the productive forces of organic nature; and if the mind be directed to one sole
class of objects, the most animated narratives of voyages in distant lands will fail to interest
and attract us, if they do not touch upon the subjects to which we are most partial.

As the history of nations -- if it were always able to trace events to their true causes --
might solve the ever-recurring enigma of the oscillations experienced by the alternately progressive
and retrograde movement of human society, so might also the physical description of the world,
the science of the 'Cosmos', if it were grasped by a powerful intellect, and based upon a knowledge
of all the results of discovery up to a given period, succeed in dispelling a portion of the
contradictions which, at first sight, appear to arise from the complication or phenomena and
the multitude of the perturbations simultaneously manifested.

The knowledge of the laws of nature, whether we can trace them in the alternate ebb and flow
of the ocean, in the measured path of comets, or in the mutual attractions of multiple stars,
alike increases our sense of the calm of nature, while the chimera so long cherished by the
human mind in its early and intuitive contemplations, the belief in a "discord of the elements,"
seems gradually to vanish in proportion as science extends her empire.  General views lead
us habitually to consider each organism as a part of the entire creation, and to recognize
in the plant or the animal not merely an isolated species, but a form linked in the chain of
being to other forms either living or extinct.  They aid us in comprehending the relations
that exist between the most recent discoveries and those which have prepared the way for them.
Although fixed to one point of space, we eagerly grasp at a knowledge of that which has been
observed in different and far-distant regions.  We delight in tracking the course of the bold
mariner through seas of polar ice, or in following him to the summit of that volcano of the
antarctic pole, whose fires may be seen from afar, even at mid-day.  It is by an acquaintance
with the results of distant voyages that we may learn to comprehend some of the marvels of
terrestrial magnetism, and be thus led to appreciate the importance of the establishments of
the numerous observatories which in the present day cover both hemispheres, and are designed
to note p 43 the simultaneous occurrence of perturbations, and the frequency and duration of
'magnetic storms.'

Let me be permitted here to touch upon a few points connected with discoveries, whose importance
can only be estimated by those who have devoted themselves to the study of the physical sciences
generally. Examples chosen from among the phenomena to which special attention has been directed
in recent times, will throw additional light upon the preceding considerations.  Without a
preliminary knowledge of the orbits of comets, we should be unable duly to appreciate the importance
attached to the discovery of one of these bodies, whose elliptical orbit is included in the
narrow limits of our solar system, and which has revealed the existence of an ethereal fluid,
tending to diminish its centrifugal force and the period of its revolution.

The superficial half-knowledge, so characteristic of the present day, which leads to the introduction
of vaguely comprehended scientific views into general conversation, also gives rise, under
various forms, to the expression of alarm at the supposed danger of a collision between the
celestial bodies, or of disturbance in the climatic relations of our globe. These phantoms
of the imagination are so much the more injurious as they derive their source from dogmatic
pretensions to true science.  The history of the atmosphere, and of the annual variations of
its temperature, extends already sufficiently far back to show the recurrence of slight disturbances
in the mean temperature of any given place, and thus affords sufficient guarantee against the
exaggerated apprehension of a general and progressive deterioration of the climates of Europe.
Encke's comet, which is one of the three 'interior comets', completes its course in 1200 days,
but from the form and position of its orbit it is as little dangerous to the earth as Halley's
great comet, whose revolution is not completed in less than seventy-six years (and which appeared
less brilliant in 1835 than it had done in 1759):  the interior comet of Biela intersects the
earth's orbit, it is true, but it can only approach our globe when its proximity to the sun
coincides with our winter solstice.

The quantity of heat received by a planet, and whose unequal distribution determines the meteorological
variations of its atmosphere, depends alike upon the light-engendering force of the sun; that
is to say, upon the condition of its gaseous coverings, and upon the relative position of the
planet and the central body.

p 44 There are variations, it is true, which, in obedience to the laws of universal gravitation,
affect the form of the earth's orbit and the inclination of the ecliptic, that is, the angle
which the axis of the earth makes with the plane of its orbit; but these periodical variations
are so slow, and are restricted within such narrow limits, that their thermic effects would
hardly be appreciable by our instruments in many thousands of years.  The astronomical causes
of a refrigeration of our globe, and of the diminution of moisture at its surface, and the
nature and frequency of certain epidemics -- phenomena which are often discussed in the present
day according to the benighted views of the Middle Ages -- ought to be considered as beyond
the range of our experience in physics and chemistry.

Physical astronomy presents us with other phenomena, which can not be fully comprehended in
all their vastness without a previous acquirement of general views regarding the forces that
govern the universe.  Such, for instance, are the innumerable double stars, or rather suns,
which revolve round one common center of gravity, and thus reveal in distant worlds the existence
of the Newtonian law; the larger or smaller number of spots upon the sun, that is to say, the
openings formed through the luminous and opaque atmosphere surrounding the solid nucleus; and
the regular appearance about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars,
which probably form part of a belt of asteroids, intersecting the earth's orbit, and moving
with planetary velocity.

Descending from the celestial regions to the earth, we would fain inquire into the relations
that exist between the oscillations of the pendulum in air (the theory of which has been perfected
by Bessel) and the density of our planet; and how the pendulum, acting the part of a plummet,
can, to a certain extent, throw light upon the geological constitution of strata at great depths?
By means of this instrument we are enabled to trace the striking analogy which exists between
the formation of the granular rocks composing the lava currents ejected from active volcanoes,
and those endogenous masses of granite, porphyry, and serpentine, which, issuing from the interior
of the earth, have broken, as eruptive rocks, through the secondary strata, and modified them
by contact, either in rendering them harder by the introduction of silex, or reducing them
into dolomite, or, finally, by inducing within them the formation of crystals of the most varied
composition.  The elevation of sporadic islands, of p 45 domes of trachyte, and cones of basalt,
by the elastic forces emanating from the fluid interior of our globe, has led one of the first
geologists of the age, Leopold von Buch, to the theory of the elevation of continents, and
of mountain chains generally.  This action of subterranean forces in breaking through and elevating
strata of sedimentary rocks, of which the coast of Chili, in consequence of a great earthquake,
furnished a recent example, leads to the assumption that the pelagic shells found by M. Bonpland
and myself on the ridge of the Andes, at an elevation of more than 15,000 English feet, may
have been conveyed to so extraordinary a position, not by a rising of the ocean, but by the
agency of volcanic forces capable of elevating into ridges the softened crust of the earth.

I apply the term 'volcanic', in the widest sense of the word, to every action exercised by
the interior of a planet on its external crust.  The surface of our globe, and that of the
moon, manifest traces of this action, which in the former, at least, has varied during the
course of ages.  Those who are ignorant of the fact that the internal heat of the earth increases
so rapidly with the increase of depth that granite is in a state of fusion about twenty or
thirty geographical miles below the surface,* can not have a clear conception of the causes,
and the simultaneous occurrence of volcanic eruptions at places widely removed from one another,
or of the extent and intersection of 'circles of commotion' in earthquakes, or of the uniformity
of temperature, and equality of chemical composition observed in thermal springs during a long
course of years.

[Footnote]  * The determinations usually given of the point of fusion are in general much too
high for refracting substances.  According to the very accurate researches of Mitscherlich,
the melting point of granite can hardly exceed 2372 degrees F. [Dr. Mantell states in 'The
Wonders of Geology', 1848, vol. i., p. 34, that this increase of temperature amounts to 1 degree
of Fahrenheit for every fifty-four feet of vertical depth.] -- Tr.

The quantity of heat peculiar to a planet is, however, a matter of such importance -- being
the result of its primitive condensation, and varying according to the nature and duration
of the radiation -- that the study of this subject may throw some degree of light on the history
of the atmosphere, and the distribution of the organic bodies imbedded in the solid crust of
the earth.  This study enables us to understand how a tropical temperature, independent of
latitude (that is, of the distance from the poles), may have been produced by deep fissures
remaining open, and exhaling heat from the interior p 46 of the globe, at a period when the
earth's crust was still furrowed and rent, and only in a state of semi-solidification; and
a primordial condition is thus revealed to us, in which the temperature of the atmosphere,
and climates generally, were owing rather to a liberation of caloric and of different gaseous
emanations (that is to say, rather to the energetic reaction of the interior on the exterior)
than to the position of the earth with respect to the central body, the sun.

The cold regions of the earth contain, deposited in sedimentary strata, the products of tropical
climates; thus, in the coal formations, we find the trunks of palms standing upright amid coniferae,
tree ferns, goniatites, and fishes having rhomboidal osseous scales;* in the Jura limestone,
colossal skeletons of crocodiles, plesiosauri, planulites, and stems of the cycadeae; in the
chalk formations, small polythalmia and bryozoa, whose species still exist in our seas; in
tripoli, or polishing slate, in the semi-opal and the farina-like opal or mountain meal, agglomerations
of siliceous infusoria, which have been brought to light by the powerful microscope of Ehrenberg;**
and, lastly, in transported soils, and in certain caves, the bones of elephants, hyenas, and lions.

[Footnote] *See the classical work on the fishes of the Old World by Agassiz, 'Rech. sur les
Poissons Fossiles', 1834, vol. i., p. 38; vol. ii., p. 3, 28, 34, App., p. 6.  The whole genus
of Amblypterus, Ag., nearly allied to Palaeoniscus (called also Palaeothrissum), lies buried
beneath the Jura formations in the old carboniferous strata.  Scales which, in some fishes,
as in the family of Lepidoides (order of Ganoides), are formed like teeth, and covered in certain
parts with enamel, belong, after the Placoides, to the oldest forms of fossil fishes; their
living representatives are still found in two genera, the 'Bichir' of the Nile and Senegal,
and the 'Lepidosteus' of the Ohio.

[Footnote] **[The 'polishing slate' of Bilin is stated by M. Ehrenberg to form a 'series' of
strata fourteen feet in thickness, entirely made up of the siliceous shells of 'Gaillonellae',
of such extreme minuteness that a cubic inch of the stone contains forty-one thousand millions!
The 'Bergmehl' ('mountain meal' or 'fossil farina') of San Fiora, in Tuscany, is one mass of
animalculites.  See the interesting work of G. A. Mantell, 'On the Medals of Creation', vol.
i., p. 233.] -- Tr.

An intimate acquaintance with the physical phenomena of the universe leads us to regard the
products of warm latitudes that are thus found in a fossil condition in northern regions not
merely as incentives to barren curiosity, but as subjects awakening deep reflection, and opening
new sources of study.

The number and the variety of the objects I have alluded to give rise to the question whether
general considerations of physical phenomena can be made sufficiently clear to persons who
have not acquired a detailed and special knowledge of p 47 descriptive natural history, geology,
or mathematical astronomy?  I think we ought to distinguish here between him whose task it
is to collect the individual details of various observations, and study the mutual relations
existing among them, and him to whom these relations are to be revealed, under the form of
general results.  The former should be acquainted with the specialities of phenomena, that
he may arrive at a generalization of ideas as the result, at least in part, of his own observations,
experiments, and calculations.  It can not be denied, that where there is an absence of positive
knowledge of physical phenomena, the general results which impart so great a charm to the study
of nature can not all be made equally clear and intelligible to the reader, but still I venture
to hope, that in the work which I am now preparing on the physical laws of the universe, the
greater part of the facts advanced can be made manifest without the necessity of appealing
to fundamental views and principles.  The picture of nature thus drawn, notwithstanding the
want of distinctness of some of its outlines, will not be the less able to enrich the intellect,
enlarge the sphere of ideas, and nourish and vivify the imagination.

There is, perhaps, some truth in the accusation advanced against many German scientific works,
that they lessen the value of general views by an accumulation of detail, and do not sufficiently
distinguish between those great results which form, as it were, the beacon lights of science,
and the long series of means by which they have been attained.  This method of treating scientific
subjects led the most illustrious of our poets* to exclaim with impatience, "The Germans have
the art of making science inaccessible."  An edifice can not produce a striking effect until
the scaffolding is removed, that had of necessity been used during its erection.

[Footnote]  *Gothe, in 'Die Aphorismen uber Naturwissenschaft', bd. I., s. 155 ('Werke kleine
Ausgabe','von' 1833.)

Thus the uniformity of figure observed in the distribution of continental masses, which all
terminate toward the south in a pyramidal form, and expand toward the north (a law that determines
the nature of climates, the direction of currents in the ocean and the atmosphere, and the
transition of certain types of tropical vegetation toward the southern temperate zone), may
be clearly apprehended without any knowledge of the geodesical and astronomical operations
by means of which these pyramidal forms of continents have been determined.  In like manner,
physical geography teaches us by how many leagues p 48 the equatorial axis exceeds the polar
axis of the globe, and shows us the mean equality of the flattening of the two hemispheres,
without entailing on us the necessity of giving the detail of the measurement of the degrees
in the meridian, or the observations on the pendulum, which have led us to know that the true
figure of our globe is not exactly that of a regular ellipsoid of revolution, and that this
irregularity is reflected in the corresponding irregularity of the movements of the moon.

The views of comparative geography have been specially enlarged by that admirable work, 'Erdkunde
im Verhltniss zur Natur und sur Geschichte', in which Carl Ritter so ably delineates the physiognomy
of our globe, and shows the influence of its external configuration on the physical phenomena
on its surface, on the migrations, laws, and manners of nations, and on all the principal historical
events enacted upon the face of the earth.

France possesses an immortal work, 'L'Exposition du Systme du Monde', in which the author
has combined the results of the highest astronomical and mathematical labors, and presented
them to his readers free from all processes of demonstration.  The structure of the heavens
is here reduced to the simple solution of a great problem in mechanics; yet Laplace's work
has never yet been accused of incompleteness and want of profundity.

The distinction between dissimilar subjects, and the separation of the general from the special,
are not only conducive to the attainment of perspicuity in the composition of a physical history
of the universe, but are also the means by which a character of greater elevation may be imparted
to the study of nature.  By the suppression of all unnecessary detail, the great masses are
better seen, and the reasoning faculty is enabled to grasp all that might otherwise escape
the limited range of the senses.

The exposition of general results has, it must be owned, been singularly facilitated by the
happy revolution experienced since the close of the last century, in the condition of all the
special sciences, more particularly of geology, chemistry, and descriptive natural history.
In proportion as laws admit of more general application, and as sciences mutually enrich each
other, and by their extension become connected together in more numerous and more intimate
relations, the development of general truths may be given with conciseness devoid of superficiality.
On being first examined, all phenomena appear to be p 49 isolated, and it is only by the result
of a multiplicity of observations, combined by reason, that we are able to trace the mutual
relations existing between them.  If, however, in the present age, which is so strongly characterized
by a brilliant course of scientific discoveries, we perceive a want of connection in the phenomena
of certain sciences, we may anticipate the revelation of new facts, whose importance will probably
be commensurate with the attention directed to these branches of study.  Expectations of this
nature may be entertained with regard to meteorology, several parts of optics, and to radiating
heat, and electro-magnetism, since the admirable discoveries of Melloni and Faraday.  A fertile
field is here opened to discovery, although the voltaic pile has already taught us the intimate
connection existing between electric, magnetic, and chemical phenomena.  Who will venture to
affirm that we have any precise knowledge, in the present day, of that part of the atmosphere
which is not oxygen, or that thousands of gaseous substances affecting our organs may not be
mixed with the nitrogen, or, finally, that we have even discovered the whole number of the
forces which pervade the universe?

It is not the purpose of this essay on the physical history of the world to reduce all sensible
phenomena to a small number of abstract principles, based on reason only.  The physical history
of the universe, whose exposition I attempt to develop, does not pretend to rise to the perilous
abstractions of a purely rational science of nature, and is simply a 'physical geography, combined
with a description of the regions of space and the bodies occupying them.'  Devoid of the profoundness
of a purely speculative philosophy, my essay on the 'Cosmos' treats of the contemplation of
the universe, and is based upon a rational empiricism, that is to say, upon the results of
the facts registered by science, and tested by the operations of the intellect.  It is within
these limits alone that the work, which I now venture to undertake, appertains to the sphere
of labor to which I have devoted myself throughout the course of my long scientific career.
The path of inquiry is not unknown to me, although it may be pursued by others with greater
success.  The unity which I seek to attain in the development of the great phenomena of the
universe, is analogous to that which historical composition is capable of acquiring.  All points
relating to the accidental individualities, and the essential variations of the actual, whether
in the form and arrangement of natural objects in the struggle of man against the elements,
or of nations against nations, do not admit of being p 50 based only on a 'rational foundation'
-- that is to say, of being deduced from ideas alone.

It seems to me that a like degree of empiricism attaches to the Description of the Universe
and to Civil History; but in reflecting upon physical phenomena and events, and tracing their
causes by the process of reason, we become more and more convinced of the truth of the ancient
doctrine, that the forces inherent in matter, and those which govern the moral necessity, and
in accordance with movements occurring periodically after longer or shorter intervals.

It is this necessity, this occult but permanent connection, this periodical recurrence in the
progressive development of forms, phenomena, and events, which constitute 'nature', obedient
to the first impulse imparted to it. Physics, as the term signifies, is limited to the explanation
of the phenomena of the material world by the properties of matter.  The ultimate object of
the experimental sciences is, therefore, to discover laws, and to trace their progressive generalization.
All that exceeds this goes beyond the province of the physical description of the universe,
and appertains to a range of higher speculative views.

Emmanuel Kant, one of the few philosophers who have escaped the imputation of impiety, has
defined with rare sagacity the limits of physical explanations, in his celebrated essay 'On
the Theory and Structure of the Heavens', published at Konigsberg in 1755.

The study of a science that promises to lead us through the vast range of creation may be compared
to a journey in a far-distant land.  Before we set forth, we consider, and often with distrust,
our own strength, and that of the guide we have chosen.  But the apprehensions which have originated
in the abundance and the difficulties attached to the subjects we would embrace, recede from
view as we remember that with the increase of observations in the present day there has also
arisen a more intimate knowledge of the connection existing among all phenomena.  It has not
unfrequently happened, that the researches made at remote distances have often and unexpectedly
thrown light upon subjects which had long resisted the attempts made to explain them within
the narrow limits of our own sphere of observation.  Organic forms that had long remained isolated,
both in the animal and vegetable kingdom, have been connected by the discovery of intermediate
links or stages of transition.  The geography of beings endowed p 51 with life attains completeness
as we see the species, genera, and entire families belonging to one hemisphere, reflected as
it were, in analogous animal and vegetable forms in the opposite hemisphere.  There are, so
to speak, the 'equivalents' which mutually personate and replace one another in the great series
of organisms.  These connecting links and stages of transition may be traced, alternately,
in a deficiency or an excess of development of certain parts, in the mode of junction of distinct
organs, in the differences in the balance of forces, or in a resemblance to intermediate forms
which are not permanent, but merely characteristic of certain phases of normal development.
Passing from the consideration of beings endowed with life to that of inorganic bodies, we
find many striking illustrations of the high state of advancement to which modern geology has
attained.  We thus see, according to the grand views of Elie de Beaumont, how chains of mountains
dividing different climates and floras and different races of men, reveal to us their 'relative
age', both by the character of the sedimentary strata they have uplifted, and by the directions
which they follow over the long fissures and which the earth's crust is furrowed. Relations
of superposition of trachyte and of syenitic porphyry, of diorite and of serpentine, which
remain in the rich platinum districts of the Oural, and on the south-western declivity of the
Siberian Alti, are elucidated by the observations that have been made on the plateaux of Mexico
and Antioquia, and in the unhealthy ravines of Choco.  The most important facts on which the
physical history of the world has been based in modern times, have not been accumulated by
chance.  It has at length been fully acknowledged, and the conviction is characteristic of
the age, that the narratives of distant travels, too long occupied in the mere recital of hazardous
adventures, can only be made a source of instruction where the traveler is acquainted with
the condition of the science he would enlarge, and is guided by reason in his researches.

It is by this tendency to generalization, which is only dangerous in its abuse, that a great
portion of the physical knowledge already acquired may be made the common property of all classes
of society; but, in order to render the instruction impaired by these means commensurate with
the importance of the subject, it is desirable to deviate as widely as possible from the imperfect
compilations designated, till the close of the eighteenth century, by the inappropriate term
of 'popular p 52 knowledge.'  I take pleasure in persuading myself that scientific subjects
may be treated of in language at once dignified, grave, and animated, and that those who are
restricted within the circumscribed limits of ordinary life, and have long remained strangers
to an intimate communion with nature, may thus have opened to them one of the richest sources
of enjoyment, by which the mind is invigorated by the acquisition of new ideas.  Communion
with nature awakens within us perceptive faculties that had long lain dormant; and we thus
comprehend at a single glance the influence exercised by physical discoveries on the enlargement
of the sphere of intellect, and perceive how a judicious application of mechanics, chemistry,
and other sciences may be made conducive to national prosperity.

A more accurate knowledge of the connection of physical phenomena will also tend to remove
the prevalent error that all branches of natural science are not equally important in relation
to general cultivation and industrial progress.  An arbitrary distinction is frequently made
between the various degrees of importance appertaining to mathematical sciences, to the study
of organized beings, the knowledge of electro-magnetism, and investigations of the general
properties of matter in its different conditions of molecular aggregation; and it is not uncommon
presumptuously to affix a supposed stigma upon researches of this nature, by terming them "purely
theoretical," forgetting , although the fact has been long attested, that in the observation
of a phenomenon, which at first sight appears to be wholly isolated, may be concealed the germ
of a great discovery.  When Aloysio Galvani first stimulated the nervous fiber by the accidental
contact of two heterogeneous metals, his contemporaries could never have anticipated that the
action of the voltaic pile would discover to us, in the alkalies, metals of a silvery luster,
so light as to swim on water, and eminently inflammable; or that it would become a powerful
instrument of chemical analysis, and at the same time a thermoscope and a magnet.  When Hygens
first observed, in 1678, the phenomenon of the polarization of light, exhibited in the difference
between the two rays into which a pencil of light divides itself in passing through a doubly
refracting crystal, it could not have been foreseen that, a century and a half later, the great
philosopher Arago would, by his discovery of 'chromatic polarization', be led to discern, by
means of a small fragment of Iceland spar, whether solar light emanates from a solid body or
a gaseous covering, or p 53 whether comets transmit light directly or merely by reflection.*

(Passage already quoted.)

An equal appreciation of all branches of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences is
a special requirement of the present age, in which the material wealth and the growing prosperity
of nations are principally based upon a more enlightened employment of the products and forces
of nature. The most superficial glance at the present condition of Europe shows that a diminution,
or even a total annihilation of national prosperity, must be the award of those states who
shrink with slothful indifference from the great struggle of rival nations in the career of
the industrial arts.  It is with nations as with nature, which, according to a happy expression
of Gthe,* "knows no pause in progress and development, and attaches her curse on all inaction."

[Footnote]  *Gothe, in 'Die Aphorismen uber Naturwissenschaft.' -- 'Werke', bd. 1., s. 4

The propagation of an earnest and sound knowledge of science can therefore alone avert the
dangers of which I have spoken.  Man can not act upon nature, or appropriate her forces to
his own use, without comprehending their full extent, and having an intimate acquaintance with
the laws of the physical world.  Bacon has said that, in human societies, knowledge is power.
Both must rise and sink together.  But the knowledge that results from the free action of thought
is at once the delight and the indestructible prerogative of man; and in forming part of the
wealth of mankind, it not unfrequently serves as a substitute for the natural riches, which
are but sparingly scattered over the earth.  Those states which take no active part in the
general industrial movement, in the choice and preparation of natural substances, or in the
application of mechanics and chemistry, and among whom this activity is not appreciated by
all classes of society, will infallibly see their prosperity diminish in proportion as neighboring
countries become strengthened and invigorated under the genial influence of arts and sciences.

As in nobler spheres of thought and sentiment, in philosophy, poetry, and the fine arts, the
object at which we aim ought to be an inward one -- an ennoblement of the intellect -- so ought
we likewise in our pursuit of science, to strive after a knowledge of the laws and the principles
of unity that pervade the vital forces of the universe; and it is by such a course that p 54
physical studies may be made subservient to the progress of industry, which is a conquest of
mind over matter.  By a happy connection of causes and effects, we often see the useful linked
to the beautiful and the exalted. The improvement of agriculture in the hands of freemen, and
on properties of a moderate extent -- the flourishing state of the mechanical arts freed from
the trammels of municipal restrictions -- the increased impetus imparted to commerce by the
multiplied means of the intellectual progress of mankind, and of the amelioration of political
institutions, in which this progress is reflected.  The picture presented by modern history
ought to convince those who are tardy in awakening to the truth of the lesson it teaches.

Nor let it be feared that the marked predilection for the study of nature, and for industrial
progress, which is so characteristic of the present age, should necessarily have a tendency
to retard the noble exertions of the intellect in the domains of philosophy, classical history,
and antiquity, or to deprive the arts by which life is embellished of the vivifying breath
of imagination.  Where all the germs of civilization are developed beneath the aegis of free
institutions and wise legislation, there is no cause for apprehending that any one branch of
knowledge should be cultivated to the prejudice of others.  All afford the state precious fruits,
whether they yield nourishment to man and constitute his physical wealth, or whether, more
permanent in their nature, they transmit in the works of mind the glory of nations to remotest
posterity.  The Spartans, notwithstanding their Doric austerity, prayed the gods to grant them
"the beautiful with the good."*

I will no longer dwell upon the considerations of the influence exercised by the mathematical
and physical sciences on all that appertains to the material wants of social life, for the
vast extent of the course on which I am entering forbids me to insist further upon the utility
of these applications.  Accustomed to distant excursions, I may, perhaps, have erred in describing
the path before us as more smooth and pleasant than it really is, for such is wont to be the
practice of those who delight in guiding others to the summits of lofty mountains:  they praise
the view even when great part of the distant plains lie hidden by clouds, knowing that this
half-transparent vapory vail imparts to the scene a certain charm from p 55 the power exercised
by the imagination over the domain of the senses.  In like manner, from the height occupied
by the physical history of the world, all parts of the horizon will not appear equally clear
and well defined. This indistinctness will not, however, be wholly owing to the present imperfect
state of some of the sciences, but in part, likewise, to the unskillfulness of the guide who
has imprudently ventured to ascend these lofty summits.

The object of this introductory notice is not, however, solely to draw attention to the importance
and greatness of the physical history of the universe, for in the present day these are too
well understood to be contested, but likewise to prove how, without detriment to the stability
of special studies, we may be enabled to generalize our ideas by concentrating them in one
common focus, and thus arrive at a point of view from which all the organisms and forces of
nature may be seen as one living active whole, animated by one sole impulse.  "Nature," as
Schelling remarks in his poetic discourse on art, "is not an inert mass; and to him who can
comprehend her vast sublimity, she reveals herself as the creative force of the universe --
before all time, eternal, ever active, she calls to life all things, whether perishable or
imperishable."

By uniting, under one point of view, both the phenomena of our own globe and those presented
in the regions of space, we embrace the limits of the science of the 'Cosmos', and convert
the physical history of the globe into the physical history of the universe, the one term being
modeled upon that of the other.  This science of the Cosmos is not, however, to be regarded
as a mere encyclopedic aggregation of the most important and general results that have been
collected together from special branches of knowledge.  These results are nothing more than
the materials for a vast edifice, and their combination can not constitute the physical history
of the world, whose exalted part it is to show the simultaneous action and the connecting links
of the forces which pervade the universe.  The distribution of organic types in different climates
and at different elevations -- that is to say, the geography of plants and animals -- differs
as widely from botany and descriptive zoology as geology does from mineralogy, properly so
called. The physical history of the universe must not, therefore, be confounded with the 'Encyclopedias
of the Natural Sciences', as they have hitherto been compiled, and whose title is as vague
as their limits are ill defined.  In the work before us, partial facts will be considered only
in relation to the whole. p 56 The higher the point of view, the greater is the necessity for
a systematic mode of treating the subject in language at once animated and picturesque.

But thought and language have ever been most intimately allied.  If language, by its originality
of structure and its native richness, can, in its delineations, interpret thought with grace
and clearness, and if, by its happy flexibility, it can paint with vivid truthfulness the objects
of the external world, it reacts at the same time upon thought, and animates it, as it were,
with the breath of life.  It is this mutual reaction which makes words more than mere signs
and forms of thought; and the beneficent influence of a language is most strikingly manifested
on its native soil, where it has sprung spontaneously from the minds of the people, whose character
it embodies.  Proud of a country that seeks to concentrate her strength in intellectual unity,
the writer recalls with delight the advantages he has enjoyed in being permitted to express
his thoughts in his native language; and truly happy is he who, in attempting to give a lucid
exposition of the great phenomena of the universe, is able to draw from the depths of a language,
which, through the free exercise of thought, and by the effusions of creative fancy, has for
centuries past exercised so powerful an influence over the destinies of man.

I HAVE endeavored, in the preceding part of my work, to explain and illustrate, by various
examples, how the enjoyments presented by the aspect of nature, varying as they do in the sources
from when they flow, may be multiplied and ennobled by an acquaintance with the connection
of phenomena and the laws by which they are regulated.  It remains, then, for me to examine
the spirit of the method in which the exposition of the 'physical description of the universe'
should be conducted, and to indicate the limits of this science in accordance with the views
I have acquired in the course of my studies and travels in various parts of the earth.  I trust
I may flatter myself with a hope that a treatise of this nature will justify the title I have
ventured to adopt for my work, and exonerate me from the reproach of a presumption that would
be doubly reprehensible in a scientific discussion.

Before entering upon the delineation of the partial phenomena p 57 which are found to be distributed
in various groups, I would consider a few general questions intimately connected together,
and bearing upon the nature of our knowledge of the external world and its different relations,
in all epochs of history and in all phases of intellectual advancement.  Under this head will
be comprised the following considerations:

1.  The precise limits of the physical description of the universe, considered as a distinct
science.

2.  A brief enumeration of the totality of natural phenomena, presented under the form of a
'general delineation of nature.'

3.  The influence of the external world on the imagination and feelings, which has acted in
modern times as a powerful impulse toward the study of natural science, by giving animation
to the description of distant regions and to the delineation of natural scenery, as far as
it is characterized by vegetable physiognomy and by the cultivation of exotic plants, and their
arrangement in well-contrasted groups.

4.  The history of the contemplation of nature, or the progressive development of the idea
of the Cosmos, considered with reference to the historical and geographical facts that have
led to the discovery of the connection of phenomena.

The higher the point of view from which natural phenomena may be considered, the more necessary
it is to circumscribe the science within its just limits, and to distinguish it from all other
analogous or auxiliary studies.

Physical cosmography is founded on the contemplation of all created things -- all that exists
in space, whether as substances or forces -- that is, all the material beings that constitute
the universe.  The science which I would attempt to define presents itself, therefore, to man,
as the inhabitant of the earth, under a two-fold form -- as the earth itself and the regions
of space.  It is with a view of showing the actual character and the independence of the study
of physical cosmography, and at the same time indicating the nature of its relations to 'general
physics, descriptive natural history, geology, and comparative geography', that I will pause
for a few moments to consider that portion of the science of the Cosmos which concerns the
earth.  As the history of philosophy does not consist of a mere material enumeration of the
philosophical views entertained in different ages, neither should the physical description
of the universe be a simple encyclopedic compilation of the sciences we have enumerated.  The
difficulty of defining the limits of intimately-connected studies has been increased, because
for centuries it has been customary to designate various branches p 58 of empirical knowledge
by terms which admit either of too wide or too limited a definition of the ideas which they
were intended to convey, and are, besides, objectionable from  having had a different signification
in those classical languages of antiquity from thish chey have been borrowed. The terms physiology,
physics, natural history, geology and geography arose, and were commonly used, long before
clear ideas were entertained of the diversity of objects embraced by these sciences, and consequently
of their reciprocal limitation.  Such is the influence of long habit upon language, that by
one of the nations of Europe most advanced in civilization the word "physic" is applied to
medicine, while in a society of justly deserved universal reputation, technical chemistry,
geology and astronomy (purely experimental sciences) are comprised under the head of "Philosophical
Transactions."

An attempt has often been made, and almost always in vain, to substitute new and more appropriate
terms for these ancient designations, which, notwithstanding their undoubted vagueness, are
now generally understood. These changes have been proposed, for the most part, by those who
have occupied themselves with the general classification of the various branches of knowledge,
from the first appearance of the great encyclopedia ('Margarita Philosophica') of Gregory Reisch,*
prior of the Chartreuse at Freiburg, toward the close of the fifteenth century, to Lord Bacon,
and from Bacon to D'Alembert; and in recent times to an eminent physicist, Andre Marie Ampere.**

[footnote] *The 'Margarita Philosophica' of Gregory Reisch, prior of the Chartreuse at Freiburg,
first appeared under the following title:  Aepitome omnis Philosophi¾, alias Margarita Philosophica,
tractans de omni generi scibili.  The Heidelberg edition (1486), and that of Strasburg (1504),
both bear this title, but the first part was suppressed in the Freiburg edition of the same
year, as well as in the twelve subsequent editions, which succeeded one another, at short intervals,
till 1535.  This work exercised a great influence on the diffusion of mathematical and physical
sciences toward the beginning of the sixteenth century, and Crasles, the learned author of
'L'Aperu  Historique des Methodes en Gometrica' (1837) has shown the great importance of
Reisch's 'Encyclopedia' in the history of mathematics in the Middle Ages.  I have had recourse
to a passage in the 'Margarita Philosophica', found only in the edition of 1513, to elucidate
the important question of the relations between the statements of the geographer of Saint-Die,
Hylacomilus (Martin Waldseemuller), the first who gave the name of America to the New Continent,
and those of Amerigo Vespucci, Rene, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Lorraine, as also those
contained in the celebrated editions of Ptolemy of 1513 and 1522.  See my 'Examen Critique
de la Gegraphie du Nouveau Continent, et des Progres de l'Astronomie Nautique aux 15e et 16e
Siecles', t. iv., p. 99-125.

p 59 The selection of an inappropriate Greek nomenclature has perhaps been even more prejudicial
to the last of these attempts than the injudicious use of binary divisions and the excessive
multiplication of groups.

The physical description of the world, considering the universe as an object of the external
senses, does undoubtedly require the aid of general physics and of descriptive natural history,
but thecontemplation of all created things, which are linked together, and form one 'whole',
animated by internal forces, given to the science we are considering a peculiar character.
Phyical science considers only the general properties of bodies; it is the product of abstraction
-- a generalization of perceptible phenomena; and even in the work in which were laid the first
foundations of general physics, in the eight books on physics of Aristotle,* all the phenomena
of nature are considered as depending upon the primitive and vital action of one sole force,
from which emaate all the movements of the universe.

The terrestrial portion of physical cosmography, for which I would willingly retain the expressive
designation of 'physical geography', treats of the distribution of magnetism in our planet
with relation to its intensity and direction, but does not enter into a consideration of the
laws of attraction or repulsion of the poles, or the means of eliciting either permanent or
transitory electro-magnetic currents.  Physical geography depicts in broad outlines the even
or irregular configuration of continents, the relations of superficial area, and the distribution
of continental masses in the two hemispheres, a distribution which exercises a powerful influence
on the diversity of climate and the meteorological modifications of the atmosphere; this science
defines the character of mountain chains, which, having been elevated at different epochs,
constitute distinct systems, whether they run in parallel lines or intersect one another; determines
the mean height of continents above the level of the sea, the position of the center of gravity
of their volume, and the relation of the highest summits of mountain chains to the mean elevation
of their crests, or to their proximity with the sea-shore.  It depicts the eruptive rocks as
principles of movement, acting upon the sedimentary rocks by traversing, uplifting, and inclining
them at various angles; it p 60 considers volcanoes either as isolated, or ranged in single
or in double series, and extending their sphere of action to various distances, either by raising
long and narrow lines of rocks, or by means of circles of commotion, which expand or diminish
in diameter in the course of ages.  This terrestrial portion of the science of the Cosmos describes
the strife of the liquid element with the solid land; it indicates the features possessed in
common by all great rivers in the upper and lower portion of their course, and in their mode
of bifurcation when their basins are unclosed; and shows us rivers breaking through the highest
mountain chains, or following for a long time a course parallel to them, either at their base,
or at a considerable distance, where the elevation of the strata of the mountain system and
the direction of their inclination correspond to the configuration of the table-land.  It is
only the general results of comparative orography and hydrography that belong to the science
whose true limits I am desirous of determining, and not the special enumeration of the greatest
elevations of our globe, of active volcanoes, of rivers, and the number of their tributaries,
these details falliing rather within the domain of geography, properly so called.  We would
here only consider phenomena in their mutual connection, and in their relations to different
zones of our planet, and to its physical constitution generally.  The specialties both of inorganic
and organized matter, classed according to analogy of form and composition, undoubtedly constitute
a most interesting branch of study, but they appertain to a sphere of ideas having no affinity
with the subject of this work.

The description of different countries certainly furnishes us with the most important materials
for the composition of a physical geography; but the combination of these different descriptions,
ranged in series, would as little give us a true image of the general conformation of the irregular
surface of our globe, as a succession of all the floras of different regions would constitute
that which I designate as a 'Geography of Plants.'  It is by subjecting isolated observations
to the process of thought, and by combining and comparing them, that we are enabled to discover
the relations existing in common between the climatic distribution of beings and the individuality
of organic forms (in the morphology or descriptive natural history of plants and animals);
and it is by induction that we are led to comprehend numerical laws, the proportion of natural
families to the whole number of species, and to designate the latitude or geographical position
of the zones in whose p 61 plains each organic form attains the maximum of its development.
Considerations of this nature, by their tendency to generalization, impress a nobler character
on the physical description of the globe, and enable us to understand how the aspect of the
scenery, that is to say, the impression produced upon the mind by the physiognomy of the vegetation,
depends upon the local distribution, the number, and the luxuriance of growth of the vegetable
forms predominating in the general mass.  The catalogues of organized beings to which was formerly
given the pompous title of 'Systems of Nature', present us with an admirably connected arrangement
by analogies of structure, either in the perfected development of these beings, or in the different
phases which, in accordance with the views of a spiral evolution, affect in vegetables the
leaves, bracts, calyx, corolla and fructifying organs; and in animals, with more or less symmetrical
regularity, the cellular and fibrous tissues, and their perfect or but obscurely developed
articulations.  But these pretended systems of nature, however ingenious their mode of classification
may be, do not show us organic beings as they are distributed in groups throughout our planet,
according to their different relations of latitude and elevation above the level of the sea,
and to climatic influences, which are owing to general and often very remote causes.  The ultimate
aim of physical geography is, however, as we have already said, to recognise unity in the vast
diversity of phenomena, and by the exercise of thought and the combination of observations,
to discern the constancy of phenomena in the midst of apparent changes.  In the exposition
of the terrestrial portion of the Cosmos, it will occasionally be necessary to descend to very
special facts; but this will only be in order to recall the connection existing between the
actual distribution of organic beings over the globe, and the laws of the ideal classification
by natural families, analogy of internal organization and progressive evolution.

It follows from these discussions on the limits of the various sciences, and more particularly
from the distinction which must necessarily be made between descriptive botany (morphology
of vegetables) and the geography of plants, that in the physical history of the globe, the
innumerable multitude of organized bodies which embellish creation are considered rather according
to 'zones of habitation' or 'stations', and to differently inflected 'isothermal bands', than
with reference to the principles of gradation in the development of internal organism.  Notwithstanding
this, botany and zoology, which constitute p 62 the descriptive natural history of all organized
beings, are the fruitful sources whence we draw the materials necessary to give a solid basis
to the study of the mutual relations and connection of phenomena.

We will here subjoin one important observation by way of elucidating the connection of which
we have spoken.  The first general glance over the vegetation of a vast extent of a continent
shows us forms the most dissimilar -- Graminae and Orchideae, Coniferae and oaks, in local
approximation to one another; while natural families and genera, instead of being locally associated,
are dispersed as if by chance.  This dispersion is, however, only apparent.  The physical description
of the globe teaches us that vegetation every where presents numerically constant relations
in the development of its forms and types; that in the same climates, the species which are
wanting in one country are replaced in a neighboring one by other species of the same family;
and that this 'law of substitution', which seems to depend upon some inherent mysteries of
the organism, considered with reference to its origin, maintains in contiguous regions a numerical
relation between the species of various great families and the general mass of the phanerogamic
plants constituting the two floras.  We thus revealed in the multiplicity of the distinct organizations
by which these regions are occupied; and we also discover in each zone, and diversified according
to the families of plants, a slow but continuous action on the aerial ocean, depending upon
the influence of light -- the primary condition of all organic vitality -- on the solid and
liquid surface of our planet.  It might be said, in accordance with a beautiful expression
of Lavoisier, that the ancient marvel of the myth of Prometheus was incessantly renewed before
our eyes.

If we extend the course which we have proposed, following in the exposition of the physical
description of the earth to the sidereal part of the science of the Cosmos, the delineation
of the regions of space and the bodies by which they are occupied, we shall find our task simplified
in no common degree.  If, according to ancient but unphilosophical forms of nomenclature, we
would distinguish between 'physics', that is to say, general considerations on the essence
of matter, and the forces by which it is actuated, and 'chemistry', which treats of the nature
of substances, their elementary composition, and those attractions that are not determined
solely by the relations of mass, we must admit that the description of the earth comprises
at p 63 once 'physical' and 'chemical' actions.  In addition to gravitation, which must be
considered as a primitive force in nature, we observe that attractions of another kind are
at work around us, both in the interior of our planet and on its surface.  These forces, to
which we apply the term 'chemical affinity', act upon molecules in contact, or at infinitely
minute distances from one another,* and which, being differently modified by electricity, heat,
condensation in porous bodies, or by the contact of an intermediate substance, animate equally
the inorganic world and animal and vegetable tissues.

[footnote]  * On the question already discussed by Newton, regarding the difference existing
between the attraction of masses and molecular attraction, see Laplace, 'Exposition du Systeme
du Monde', p. 384, and supplement to book x. of the 'Mecanique Celeste', p. 3, 4; Kant, 'Metaph.
Anfangegrunde der Naturwissenschaft, Sm. Werke', 1839, bd. v., s. 309 (Metaphysical Principles
of the Natural Sciences); Pectet, 'Physique', 1838, vol. i., p. 59-63.

If we except the small asteroids, which appear to us under the forms of aerolites and shooting
stars, the regions of space have hitherto presented to our direct observation physical phenomena
alone; and in the case of these, we know only with certainty the effects depending upon the
quantitative relations of matter of the distribution of masses.  The phenomena of the regions
of space may consequently be considered as influenced by simple dynamical laws -- the laws
of motion.

The effects that may arise from the specific difference and the hererogeneous nature of matter
have not hitherto entered into our calculations of the mechanism of the heavens.  The only
means by which the inhabitants of our planet can enter into relation with the matter contained
within the regions of space, whether existing in scattered forms or united into large spheroids,
is by the phenomena of light, the propagation of the force of gravitation or the attraction
of masses.  The existence of a periodical action of the sun and moon on the variations of terrestrial
magnetism is even at the present day extremely problematical.  We have no direct experimental
knowledge regarding the properties and specific qualities of the masses circulating in space,
or of the matter of which they are probably composed, if we except what may be derived from
the fall of aerolites or meteoric stones, which, as we have already observed, enter within
the limits of our terrestrial sphere.  It will be sufficient here to remark, that the direction
and the excessive velocity of projection (a velocity wholly planetary) manifested by these
masses, render it more than probable that p 64 they are small celestial bodies, which, being
attracted by our planet, are made to deviate from their original course, and thus reach the
earth enveloped in vapors, and in a high state of actual incandescence.  The familiar aspect
of these asteroids, and the analogies which they present with the minerals composing the earth's
crust, undoubtedly afford ample grounds for surprise,* but, in my opinion, the only conclusion
to be drawn from these facts is that, in general, planets and other sidereal masses, which
by the influence of a central body, have been agglomerated into rings of vapor, and subsequently
into spheroids, being integrant parts of the same system, and having one common origin, may
likewise be composed of substances chemically identical.

[footnote]  I[The analysis of an aerolite which fell a few years since in Maryland, United
States, and was examined by Professor Silliman, of New Haven, Connecticut, gave the following
results:  Oxyd of iron, 24; oxyd of nickel, 1.25; silica, with earthy matter, 3.46; sulphur,
a trace - 28.71. Dr. Mantell's 'Wonders of Geology', 1848, vol. i., p. 51.] -- 'Tr.'

Again, experiments with the pendulum, particularly those prosecuted with such rare precision
by Bessel, confirm the Newtonian axiom, that bodies the most heterogeneous in their nature
(as water, gold, quartz, granular limestone, and different masses of aerolites) experience
a perfectly similar degree of acceleration from the attraction of the earth.  To the experiments
of the pendulum may be added the proofs furnished by purely astronomical observations.  The
almost perfect identity of the mass of Jupiter, deduced from the influence exercised by this
stupendous planet on its own satellites, on Enck's comet of short period, and on the small
planets Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, indicates with equal certainty that within the limits
of actual observation attraction is determined solely by the quantity of matter.*

This absence of any perceptible difference in the nature of matter, alike proved by direct
observation and theoretical deductions, imparts a high degree of simplicity to the mechanism
of the heavens.  The immeasurable extent of the regions of space being subjected to laws of
motion alone, the sidereal portion of the science of the Cosmos is based on the pure and abundant
source of mathematical astronomy, as is the terrestrial portion on physics, chemistry, and
organic morphology; but the domain of these three last-named sciences embraces p 65 the consideration
of phenomena which are so complicated and have, up to the present time, been found so little
susceptible of the application of rigorous method, that the physical science of the earth can
not boast of the same certainty and simplicity in the exposition of facts and their mutual
connection which characterize the celestial portion of the Cosmos.  It is not improbable that
the difference to which we allude may furnish an explanation of the cause which, in the earliest
ages of intellectual culture among the Greeks, directed the natural philosophy of the Pythagoreans
with more ardor to the heavenly bodies and the regions of space than to the earth and its productions,
and how through Philolaus, and subsequently through the analogous views of Aristarchus of Samos,
and of Seleucus of Erythrea, this science has been made more conducive to the attainment of
a knowledge of the true system of the world than the natural philosophy of the Ionian school
could ever be to the physical history of the earth.  Giving but little attention to the properties
and specific differences of matter filling space, the great Italian school, in its Doric gravity,
turned by preference toward all that relates to measure, to the form of bodies, and to the
number and distances of the planets,* while the Ionian physicists directed their attention
to the qualities of matter, its true or supposed metamorphoses, and to relations of origin.

It was reserved for the powerful genius of Aristotle, alike profoundly speculative and practical
to sound with equal success the depths of abstraction and the inexhaustible resources of vital
activity pervading the material world.

Several highly distinguished treatises on physical geography are prefaced by an introduction,
whose purely astronomical sections are directed to the consideration of the earth in its planetary
dependence, and as constituting a part of that great system which is animated by one central
body, the sun. This course is diametrically opposed to the one which I propose following. In
order adequately to estimate the dignity of the Cosmos, it is requisite that the sidereal portion,
termed by Kant the 'natural history of the heavens', should not be made subordinate to the
terrestrial.  In the science of the Cosmos, according to the expression of Aristarchus of Samos,
the pioneer of the Copernican system, the sun, with its satellites, was nothing more than one
of the innumerable stars by which space is occupied.  The physical history of the world must,
therefore, begin with the description of the heavenly bodies, p 66 and with a geographical
sketch of the universe, or, I would rather say, a true 'map of th world', such as was traced
by the bold hand of the elder Herschel.  If, notwithstanding the smallness of our planet, the
most considerable space and the most attentive consideration be here afforded to that which
exclusively concerns it, this arises solely from the disproportion in the extent of our knowledge
of that which is accessible and of that which is closed to our observation.  This subordination
of the celestial to the terrestrial portion is met with in the great work of Bernard Varenius,*
which appeared in the middle of the seventeenth century.

[Footnote]  *'Geographia Generalis in qua affectiones generales telluris explicantur.'  The
oldest Elzevir edition bears date 1650, the second 1672, and the third 1681; these were published
at Cambridge, under Newton's supervision.  This excellent work by Varenius is, in the true
sense of the words, a physical description of the earth.  Since the work 'Historia Natural
de las Indias', 1590, in which the Jesuit Joseph de Acosta sketched in so masterly a manner
the delineation of the New Continent, questions relating to the physical history of the earth
have never been considered with such admirable generality.  Acosta is richer in original observations,
while Varenius embraces a wider circle of ideas, since his sojourn in Holland, which was at
that period the center of vast commercial relations, had brought him in contact with a great
number of well-iinformed travelers. 'Generalis sive Universalis Geographia dictur quae tellurem
in genere considerat atque affectiones explicat, non habita particularium regionum ratione.'
The general description of the earth by Varenius ('Pars Absoluta', cap. i.-xxii.) may be considered
as a treatise of comparative geography, if we adopt the term used by the author himself ('Geographia
Comparativa', cap. xxxiii.-xl.), although this must be understood in a limited acceptation.
We may cite the following among the most remarkable passages of this book:  the enumeration
of the systems of mountains; the examination of the relations existing between their directions
and the general form of continents (p. 66, 76, ed. Cantab., 1681); a list of extinct volcanoes,
and such as were still in a state of activity; the discussion of facts relative to the general
distribution of islands and archipelagoes (p. 220); the depth of the ocean relatively to the
height of neighboring coasts (p. 103); the uniformity of level observed in all open seas (p.
97); the dependence of currents on the prevailing winds; the unequal saltness of the sea; the
configuration of shores (p. 139); the direction of the winds as the result of differences of
temperature, etc.  We may further instance the remarkable considerations of Varenius regarding
the equinoctial current from east to west, to which he attributes the origin of the Gulf Stream,
beginning at Cape St. Augustin, and issuing forth between Cuba and Florida (p. 140).  Nothing
can be more accurate than his description of the current which skirts the western coast of
Africa, between Cape Verde and the island of Fernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea.  Varenius explains
the formation of sporadic islands by supposing them to be "the raised bottom of the sea:" 'magna
spirituum inclusorum vi, sicut aliquando montes e terra protusos esse quidam scribunt' (p.
225).  The edition published by Newton in 1681 ('auctior et emendatior' unfortunately contains
no additions from this great authority; and there is not even mention made of the polar compression
of the globe, although the experiments on the pendulum by Richer had been made nine years prior
to the appearance of the Cambridge edition.  Newton's 'Principia Mathematica Philosophie Naturalis'
were not communicated in manuscript to the Royal Society until April, 1686.  Much uncertainty
seems to prevail regarding the birth-place of Varenius.  Jaecher says it was England, while,
according to 'La Biographie Universelle' (b.xlvii., p. 495), he is stated to have been born
at Amsterdam; but it would appear, from the dedicatory address to the burgomaster of that city
(see his 'Geographia Comparativa', that both suppositions are false.  Varenius expressly says
that he had sought refuge in Amsterdam, "because his native city had been burned and completely
destroyed during a long war," words which appear to apply to the north of Germany, and to the
devastations of the Thirty Years' War.  In his dedication of another work, 'Descriptio regni
Japoniae' (Amst., 1649), to the Senate of Hamburgh, Varenius says that he prosecuted his elementary
mathematical studies in the gymnasium of that city.  There is, therefore, every reason to believe
that this admirable geographer was a native of Germany, and was probably born at Luneburg ('Witten.
Mem. Theol.', 1685, p. 2142; Zedler, 'Universal Lexicon', vol. xlvi., 1745, p. 187).

p 67 He was the first to distinguish between 'general and special geography', the former of
which he subdivides into an 'absolute', or, properly speaking, 'terrestrial' part, and a 'relative
or planetary' portion, according to the mode of considering our planet either with reference
to its surface in its different zones, or to its relations to the sun and moon.  It redounds
to the glory of Varenius that his work on 'General and Comparative Geography' should in so
high a degree have arrested the attention of Newton.  The imperfect state of many of the auxiliary
sciences from which this writer was obliged to draw his materials prevented his work from corresponding
to the greatness of the design, and it was reserved for the present age, and for my own country,
to see the delineation of comparative geography, drawn in its full extent, and in all its relations
with the history of man, by the skillful hand of Carl Ritter.*

[Footnote]  *Carl Ritter's 'Erdkunde im Verhltniss zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen,
oder allgemeine vergleichende Geographie' (Geography in relation to Nature and the History
of Man, or general Comparative Geography).

The enumeration of the most important results of the astronomical and physical sciences which
in the history of the Cosmos radiate toward one common focus, may perhaps, to a certain degree,
justify the designation I have given to my work, and, considered within the circumscribed limits
I have proposed to myself, the undertaking may be esteemed less adventurous than the title.
The introduction of new terms, especially with reference to the general results of a science
which p 68 ought to be accessible to all, has always been greatly in opposition to my own practice;
and whenever I have enlarged upon the established nomenclature, it has only been in the specialities
of descriptive botany and zoology, where the introduction of hitherto unknown objects rendered
new names necessary.  The denominations of physical descriptions of the universe, or physical
cosmography, which I use indiscriminantely, have been modeled upon those of 'physical descriptions
of the earth', that is to say, 'physical geography', terms that have long been in common use.
Descartes, whose genius was one of the most powerful manifested in any age, has left us a few
fragments of a great work, which he intended publishing under the title of 'Monde', and for
which he had prepared hiimself by special studies, including even that of human anatomy.  The
uncommon, but definite expression of the 'science of the Cosmos' recalls to the mind of the
inhabitant of the earth that we are treating of a more widely-extended horizon -- of the assemblage
of all things with which space is filled, from the remotest nebulae to the climatic distribution
of those delicate tissues of vegetable matter which spread a variegated covering over the surface
of our rocks.

The influence of narrow-minded views peculiar to the earlier ages of civilization led in all
languages to a confusion of ideas in the synonymic use of the words 'earth' and 'world', while
the common expressions 'voyages round the world', 'map of the world', and 'new world', afford
further illustrations of the same confusion.  The  more noble and precisely-defined expressions
of 'system of the world', 'the planetary world', and 'creation and age of the world', relate
either to the totality of the substances by which space is filled, or to the origin of the
whole universe.

It was natural that, in the midst of the extreme variability of phenomena presented by the
surface of our globe, and the aerial ocean by which it is surrounded, man should have been
impressed by the aspect of the vault of heaven, and the uniform and regular movements of the
sun and planets.  Thus the word Cosmos, which primitively, in the Homeric ages, indicated an
idea of order and harmony, was subsequently adopted in scientific language, where it was gradually
applied to the order observed in the movements of the heavenly bodies, to the whole universe,
and then finally to the world in which this harmony was reflected to us.  According to the
assertion of Philolaus, whose fragmentary works have been so ably commented upon by Bckh,
and conformably to the general testimony p 69 of antiquity, Pythagoras was the first who used
the word Cosmos to designate the order that reigns in the universe, or entire world.*

[footnote]  *[Greek word], in the most ancient, and at the same time most
precise, definition of the word, signified 'ornament' (as an adornment for a
man, a woman, or a horse); taken figuratively for [Greek word], it implied
the order or adornment of a discourse.  According to the testimony of all
the ancients, it was Pythagoras who first used the word to designate the
order in the universe, and the universe itself.  Pythagoras left no
writings; but ancient attestation to the truth of this assertion is to be
found in several passages of the fragmentary works of Philolaus (Stob.,
'Eclog.', p. 360 and 460, Heeren), p. 62, 90, in Bockh's German edition.  I
do not, according to the example of Nake, cite Timof Locris, since his
authenticity is doubtful.  Plutarch ('De plac. Phil.', ii., I) says, in the
most express manner, that Pythatoras gave the name of Cosmos to the universe
on account of the order which reigned throughout it; so likewise does Galen
('Hist. Phil.', p. 429).  This word, together with its novel signification,
passed from the schools of philosophy into the language of poets and prose
writers.  Plato designates the heavenly bodies by the name of 'Uranos', but
the order pervading the regions of space he too terms the Cosmos, and in his
'Timus' (p. 30 a.) he says 'that the world is an animal endowed with a soul'
 [Greek words].  Compare Anaxag. Claz., ed. Schaubach, p. III, and Plut.
('De plac. Phil.', in Aristotle ('De Caelo', I, 9), 'Cosmos' signifies "the
universe and the order pervading it," but it is likewise considered as
divided in space into two parts -- the sublunary world, and the world above
the moon.  ('Meteor.', I., w, 1, and I., 3, 13, p. 339, 'a', and 340, 'b',
Bekk.)  The definition of Cosmos, which I have already cited is taken from
Pseudo-Aristoteles 'de Mundo', cap. ii. (p. 391); the passage referred to is
as follows:  [Greek words].  Most of the passages occurring in Greek writers
on the word 'Cosmos' may be found collected together in the controversy
between Richard Bentley and Charles Boyle ('Opuscula Philologica', 1781, p.
347, 445; 'Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris', 1817, p. 254); on
the historical existence of Zaleucus, legislator of Leucris, in Nake's
excellent work, 'Sched. Crit.', 1812, p. 9, 15; and, finally in Theophilus
Schmidt, 'ad Cleom. Cycl. Theor.', met. I., 1, p. ix., 1 and 99.  Taken in a
more limited sense, the word Cosmos is also used in the plural (Plut., 1,
5), either to designate the stars (Stob., 1, p. 514; Plut., 11, 13) or the
innumerable systems scattered like islands through the immensity of space,
and each composed of a sun and a moon.  (Anax. Claz., 'Fragm.', p. 89, 93,
120; Brandis, 'Gesch. der Griechisch-Rmischen Philosophie', b. i., s. 252
(History of the Greco-Roman Philosophy).  Each of these groups forming thus
a 'Cosmos', the universe, [Greek words], the word must be understood in a
wider sense (Plut., ii., 1).  It was not until long after the time of the
Ptolemies that the word was applied to the earth.  Bockh has made known
inscriptions in praise of Trajan and Adrian ('Corpus Inscr. Graec.', I, n.
334 and 1036), in which [Greek word] occurs for [Greek word] in the same
manner as we still use the term 'world' to signify the earth alone.  We have
already mentioned the singular division of the regions of space
p 70  [Footnote continues]
into three parts, the 'Olympus, Cosmos' and 'Ouranos' (Stob., i., p. 488;
Philolaus, p. 95, 303);  this division applies to the different regions
surrounding that mysterious focus of the universe, the [Greek words] of the
Pythagoreans.  In the fragmentary passage in which this division is found,
the term [Greek word] designates the innermost region, situated between the
moon and earth; this is the domain of changing things.  The middle region,
where the planets circulate in an invariable and harmonious order, is, in
accordance with the special conceptions entertained of the universe,
exclusively termed 'Cosmos', while the word 'Olympus' is used to express the
exterior or igneous region.  Bopp, the profound philologist, has remarked
that we may deduce, as Pott has done, 'Etymol. Forschungen', th.i., s. 39
and 252 ('Etymol. Researches'), the word [Greek word]  from the Sanscrit
root 'sud', 'purificari', by assuming two conditions; first that the Greek
letter 'kappa' in [Greek word] comes from the palatial 'epsilon', which Bopp
represents by 's' and Pott by '' (in the same manner as [Greek word],
'decem, taihun' in Gothic, comes from the Indian word 'dasan'), and, next,
that the Indian 'd'' corresponds, as a general rule, with the Greek 'theta'
('Vergleichende Grammatik' 99 -- Comparative Grammar), which shows the
relation of [Greek word] (for [Greek word]) with the Sanscrit root 'sud',
whence is also derived [Greek word].  Another Indian term for the world is
'gagat' (pronounced 'dschagat'), which is, properly speaking the present
participle of the verb 'gagami' (I go), the root of which is 'ga.'  In
restricting ourselves to the circle of Hellenic etymologies, we find
('Etymol. M.', p. 532, 12) that [Greek word] is intimately associated with
[Greek word] or rather with [Greek word], whence we have [Greek word] or
[Greek word]  Welcker ('Eine Kretische Col in Theben', s. 23 -- A Cretan
Colony in Thebes) combines with this the name [Greek word] , as in Hesychius
[Greek word] signifies a Cretan suit of arms.  When the scientific language
of Greece was introduced among the Romans, the word 'mundus', which at first
had only the primary meaning of [Greek word] (female ornament), was applied
to designate the entire universe.  Ennius seems to have been the first who
ventured upon this innovation.  In one of the fragments of this poet,
preserved by Macrobius, on the occasion of his quarrel with Virgil, we find
the word used in its novel mode of acceptation: "Mundus caeli vastus
constitit silentio" (Sat., vi., 2).  Cicero also says, "Quem nos lucentem
mundum vocamus" (Tim¾us, 'S.de univer.', cap. x.)  The Sanscrit root 'mand'
from which Pott derives the Latin 'mundus' ('Etym. Forsch.', th. i., s.
240), combines the double signification of shining and adorning.  'Loka'
designates in Sanscrit the world and people in general, in the same manner
as the French word 'monde', and is derived according to Bopp, from 'lok' (to
see and shine); it is the same with the Slavonic root 'swjet', which means
both 'light' and 'world.'  (Grimm, 'Deutsche Gramm.', b. iii., s. 394 --
German Grammar.)  The word 'welt', which the Germans make use of at the
present day, and which was 'weralt' in old German, 'worold' in old Saxon,
and 'weruld' in Anglo-Saxon, was, according to James Grimm's interpretation,
a period of time, an age ('saeculum') rather than a term used for the world
in space.  The Etruscans figured to themselves 'mundus' as an inverted dome,
symmetrically opposed to the celestial vault (Otfried Muller's 'Etrusken',
th. ii., s. 96, etc.).  Taken in a still more limited sense, the word
appears to have signified among the Goths the terrestrial surface girded by
seas ('marei, meri',) the 'merigard', literally, 'garden of seas.'

From the Italian school of philosophy, the expression passed, in this signification, into the
language of those early poets p 71 of nature, Parmenides and Empedocles, and from thence into
the works of prose writers.  We will not here enter into a discussion of the manner in which,
according to the Pythagorean views, Philolaus distinguishes between Olympus, Uranus, or the
heavens, and Cosmos, or how the same word, used in a plural sense, could be applied to certain
heavenly bodies (the planets) revolving round one central focus of the world, or to groups
of stars.  In this work I use the word Cosmos in conformity with the Hellenic usage of the
term subsequently to the time of Pythagorus, and in accordance with the precise definition
given of it in the treatise entitled 'De Mundo', which was long erroneously attributed to Aristotle.
It is the assemblage of all things in heaven and earth, the universality of created things
constituting the perceptible world.  If scientific terms had not long been diverted from their
true verbal signification, the present work ought rather to have borne the title of 'Cosmography',
divided into 'Uranography' and 'Geography.'  The Romans, in their feeble essays on philosophy,
imitated the Greeks by applying to the universe the term 'mundus', which, in its primary meaning,
indicated nothing more than ornament, and did not even imply order or regularity in the disposition
of parts.  It is probable that the introduction into the language of Latium of this technical
term as an equivalent for Cosmos, in its double signification, is due to Ennius,* who was a
follower of the Italian school, and the translator of the writings of Epicharmus and some of
his pupils on the Pythagorean philosophy.

[footnote]  *See, on Ennius, the ingenious researches of Leopold Krahner, in his 'Grundlinien
zur Geschichte des Verfalls der Romischen Staats-Reigion', 1837, s. 41-45 (Outlines of the
History of the Decay of the Established Religion among the Romans).  In all probability, Ennius
did not quote from writings of Epicharmus himself, but from poems composed in the name of that
philosopher, and in accordance with his views.

We would first distinguish between the physical 'history' and the physical 'description' of
the world.  The former, conceived in the most general sense of the word, ought, if materials
for writing it existed, to trace the variations experienced by the universe in the course of
ages from the new stars which have suddenly appeared and disappeared in the vault of heaven,
from nebul¾ dissolving or condensing -- to the first stratum of cryptogamic vegetation on the
still imperfectly cooled surface of the earth, or on a reef of coral uplifted from the depths
of ocean.  'The physical description of the world' presents a picture of all that exists in
space -- of the siimultaneous action of p 72 natural forces, together with the phenomena which
they produce.

But if we would correctly comprehend nature, we must not entirely or absolutely separate the
consideration of the present state of things from that of the successive phases through which
they have passed.  We can not form a just conception of their nature without looking back on
the mode of their formation.  It is not organic matter alone that is continually undergoing
change, and being dissolved to form new combinations.  The globe itself reveals at every phase
of its existence the mystery of its former conditions.

We can not survey the crust of our planet without recognizing the traces of the prior existence
and destruction of an organic world.  The sedimentary rocks present a succession of organic
forms, associated in groups, which have successively displaced and succeeded each other.  The
different super-imposed strata thus display to us the faunas and floras of different epochs.
In this sense the description of nature is intimately connected with its history; and the geologist,
who is guided by the connection existing among the facts observed, can not form a conception
of the present without pursuing, through countless ages, the history of the past.  In tracing
the physical delineation of the globe, we behold the present and the past reciprocally incorporated,
as it were, with one another; for the domain of nature is like that of languages, in which
etymological research reveals a successive development, by showing us the primary condition
of an idiom reflected in the forms of speech in use at the present day.  The study of the material
world renders this reflection of the past peculiarly manifest, by displaying in the process
of formation rocks of eruption and sedimentary strata similar to those of former ages.  If
I may be allowed to borrow a striking illustration from the geological relations by which the
physiognomy of a country is determined, I would say that domes of trachyte, cones of basalt,
lava streams ('coules')of amygdaloid with elongated and parallel pores, and white deposits
of pumice, intermixed with black scoriae, animate the scenery by the associations of the past
which they awaken, acting upon the imagination of the enlightened observer like traditional
records of an earlier world.  Their form is their history.

The sense in which the Greeks and Romans originally employed the word 'history' proves that
they too were intimately convinced that, to form a complete idea of the present state of the
universe, it was necessary to consider it in its successive p 73 phases.  It is not, however,
in the definition given by Valerius Flaccus,* but in the zoological writings of Aristotle,
that the word 'history' presents itself as an exposition of the results of experience and observation.

[Footnote] *Aul. Gell., 'Nect. Att.', v., 18.

The physical description of the word by Pliny the elder bears the title of 'Natural History',
while in the letters of his nephew it is designated by the nobler term of 'History of Nature.'
The earlier Greek historians did not separate the description of countries from the narrative
of events of which they had been the theater.  With these writers, physical geography and history
were long intimately associated, and remained simply but elegantly blended until the period
of the development of political interests, when the agitation in which the lives of men were
passed caused the geographical portion to be banished from the history of nations, and raised
into an independent science.

It remains to be considered whether by the operation of thought, we may hope to reduce the
immense diversity of phenomena comprised by the Cosmos to the unity of a principle, and the
evidence afforded by rational truths.  In the present state of empirical knowledge, we can
scarcely flatter ourselves with such a hope.  Experimental sciences, based on the observation
of the external world, can not aspire to completeness; the nature of things, and the imperfection
of our organs, are alike opposed to it.  We shall never succeed in exhausting the immeasurable
riches of nature; and no generation of men will ever have cause to boast of having comprehended
the total aggregation of phenomena.  It is only by distributing them into groups that we have
been able, in the case of a few, to discover the empire of certain natural laws, grand and
simple as nature itself.  The extent of this empire will no doubt increase in proportion as
physical sciences are more perfectly developed.  Striking proofs of this advancement have been
made manifest in our own day, in the phenomena of electro-magnetism, the propagation of luminous
waves and radiating heat.  In the same manner, the fruitful doctrine of evolution shows us
how, in organic development, all that is formed is sketched out beforehand, and how the tissues
of vegetable and animal matter uniformly arise from the multiplication and transformation of cells.

The generalization of laws, which, being at first bounded by narrow limits, had been applied
solely to isolated groups of phenomena, acquires in time more marked gradations, and gains
in extent and certainty as long as the process of reasoning p 74 is applied strictly to analogous
phenomena; but as soon as dynamical views prove insufficient where the specific properties
and heterogeneous nature of matter come into play; it is to be feared that, by persisting in
the pursuit of laws, we may find our course suddenly arrested by an impassible chasm. The principle
of unity is lost sight of, and the guiding clew is rent asunder whenever any specific and peculiar
kind of action manifests itself amid the active forces of nature.  The law of equivalents and
the numerical proportions of composition, so happily recognized by modern chemists, and proclaimed
under the ancient form of atomic symbols, still remains isolated and independent of mathematicl
laws of motion and gravitation.

Those productions of nature which are objects of direct observation may be logically distributed
in classes, orders, and families.  This form of distribution undoubtedly sheds some light on
descriptive natural history, but the study of organized bodies, considered in their linear
connection, although it may impart a greater degree of unity and simplicity to the distribution
of groups, can not rise to the height of a classification based on one sole principle of composition
and internal organization.  As different gradations are presented by the laws of nature according
to the extent of the horizon, or the limits of the phenomena to be considered, so there are
likewise differently graduated phases in the investigation of the external world.  Empiricism
originates in isolated views, which are subsequently grouped according to their analogy or
dissimilarity.  To direct observation succeeds, although long afterward, the wish to prosecute
experiments; that is to say, to evoke phenomena under different determined conditions.  The
rational experimentalist does not proceed at hazard, but acts under the guidance of hypotheses,
founded on a half indistinct and more or less just intuition of the connection existing among
natural objects or forces.  That which has been conquered by observation or by means of experiments,
leads, by analysis and induction, to the discovery of empirical laws.  These are the phases
in human intellect that have marked the different epochs in the life of nations, and by means
of which that great mass of facts has been accumulated which constitutes at the present day
the solid basis of the natural sciences.

Two forms of abstraction conjointly regulate our knowledge, namely, relations of 'quantity',
comprising ideas of number and size, and relations of 'quality', embracing the consideration
of the specific properties and the heterogeneous nature p 75 of matter.  The former, as being
more accessible to the exercise of thought, appertains to mathematics; the latter, from the
apparent mysteries and greater difficulties, falls under the domain of the chemical sciences.
In order to submit phenomena to calculation, recourse is had to a hypothetical construction
of matter by a combination of molecules and atoms, whose number, form, position, and polarity
determine, modify, or vary phenomena.

The mythical ideas long entertained of the imponderable substances and vital forces peculiar
to each mode of organization, have complicated our views generally, and shed an uncertain light
on the path we ought to pursue.

The most various forms of intuition have thus, age after age, aided in augmenting the prodigious
mass of empirical knowledge, which, in our own day has been enlarged with ever-increasing rapidity.
The investigating spirit of man strives from time to time, with varying success, to break through
those ancient forms and symbols invented, to subject rebellious matter to rules of mechanical
construction.

We are still very far from the time when it will be possible for us to reduce, by the operation
of thought, all that we perceive by the senses, to the unity of a rational principle.  It may
even be doubted if such a victory could ever be achieved in the field of natural philosophy.
The complication of phenomena, and of the vast extent of the Cosmos, would seem to oppose such
a result; but even a partial solution of the problem -- the tendency toward a comprehension
of the phenomena of the universe -- will not the less remain the eternal and sublime aim of
every investigation of nature.

In conformity with the character of my former writings, as well as with the labors in which
I have been engaged during my scientific career, in measurements, experiments, and the investigation
of facts, I limit myself to the domain of empirical ideas.

The exposition of mutually connected facts does not exclude the classification of phenomena
according to their rational connection, the generalization of many specialities in the great
mass of observations, or the attempt to discover laws.  Conceptions of the universe solely
based upon reason, and the principles of speculative philosophy, would no doubt assign a still
more exalted aim to the science of the Cosmos.  I am far from blaming the efforts of others
solely because their success has hitherto remained very doubtful.  Contrary to the wishes and
counsel of of those profound and powerful thinkers who p 76 have given new life to speculations
which were already familiar to the ancients, systems of natural philosophy have in our own
country for some time past turned aside the minds of men from the graver study of mathematical
and physical sciences.  The abuse of better powers, which has led many of our noble but ill-judging
youth into the saturnalia of a purely ideal science of nature, has been signalized by the intoxication
of pretended conquests, by a novel and fantastically symbolical phraseology, and by a predilection
for the formulae of a scholastic rationalism, more contracted in its views than any known to
the Middle Ages.  I use the expression "abuse of better powers," because superior intellects
devoted to philosophical pursuits and experimental sciences have remained strangers to these
saturnalia.  The results yielded by an earnest investigation in the path of experiment can
not be at variance with a true philosophy of nature. If there be any contradiction, the fault
must lie either in the unsoundness of speculation, or in the exaggerated pretensions of empiricism,
which thinks that more is proved by experiment than is actually derivable from it.

External nature may be opposed to the intellectual world, as if the latter were not comprised
within the limits of the former, or nature may be opposed to art when the latter is defined
as a manifestation of the intellectual power of man; but these contrasts, which we find reflected
in the most cultivated languages, must not lead us to separate the sphere of nature from that
of mind, since such a separation would reduce the physical science of the world to a mere aggregation
of empirical specialities.  Science does not present itself to man until mind conquers matter
in striving to subject the result of experimental investigation to rational combinations. 
Science is the labor of mind applied to nature, but the external world has no real existence
for us beyond the image reflected within ourselves through the medium of the senses.  As intelligence
and forms of speech, thought and its verbal symbols, are united by secret and indissoluble
links, so does the external world blend almost unconsciously to ourselves with our ideas and
feelings.  "External phenomena," says Hegel, in his 'Philosophy of History', "are in some degree
translated in our inner representations."  The objective world, conceived and reflected within
us by thought, is subjected to the eternal and necessary conditions of our intellectual being.
The activity of the mind exercises itself on the elements furnished to it by the perceptions
of the senses.  Thus, in the p 77 early ages of mankind, there manifests itself in the simple
intuition of natural facts, and in the efforts made to comprehend them, the germ of the philosophy
of nature.  These ideal tendencies vary, and are more or less powerful, according to the individual
characteristics and moral dispositions of nations, and to the degrees of their mental culture,
whether attained amid scenes of nature that excite or chill the imagination.

History has preserved the record of the numerous attempts that have been made to form a rational
conception of the whole world of phenomena, and to recognize in the universe the action of
one sole active force by which matter is penetrated, transformed, and animated.  These attempts
are traced in classical antiquity in those treatises on the principles of things which emanated
from the Ionian school, and in which all the phenomena of nature were subjected to hazardous
speculations, based upon a small number of observations.  By degrees, as the influence of great
historical events has favored the development of every branch of science supported by observation,
that ardor has cooled which formerly led men to seek the essential nature and connection of
things by ideal construction and in purely rational principles.  In recent times, the mathematical
portion of natural philosophy has been most remarkably and admirably enlarged.  The method
and the instrument (analysis) have been simultaneously perfected.  That which has been acquired
by means so different -- by the ingenious application of atomic suppositions, by the more general
and intimate study of phenomena, and by the improved construction of new apparatus -- is the
common property of mankind, and shouldnot, in our opinion, now, more than in ancient times,
be withdrawn from the free exercise of speculative thought.

It can not be denied that in this process of thought, the results of experience have had to
contend with many disadvantages; we must not, therefore, be surprised if, in the perpetual
vicissitude of theoretical views, as is ingeniously expressed by the author of 'Giordano Bruno',
"most men see nothing in philosophy but a succession of passing meteors, while even the grander
forms in which she has revealed herself share the fate of comets, bodies that do not rank in
popular opinion among the eternal and permanent works of nature, p 78 but are regarded as mere
fugitive apparitions of igncor vapor."

(Bruno, on the 'Divine and Natural Principle of Things')

We would here remark that the abuse of thought, and the false track it too often pursues, ought
not to sanction an opinion derogatory to the intellect, which would imply that the domain of
mind is essentially a world of vague fantastic illusions, and that the treasures accumulated
by laborious observations in philosophy are powers hostile to its own empire.  It does not
become the spirit which characterizes the present age distrustfully to reject every generalization
of views and every attempt to examine into the nature of things by the process of reason and
induction.  It would be a denial of the dignity of human nature and the relative importance
of the faculties with which we are endowed, were we to condemn at one time austere reason engaged
in investigating causes and their natural connections, and at another that exercise of the
imagination which prompts and excites discoveries by its creative powers.

DELINEATION OF NATURE.  GENERAL REVIEW OF NATURAL PHENOMENA.

WHEN the human mind first attempts to subject to its control the world of
physical phenomena, and strives by meditative contemplation to penetrate the
rich luxuriance of living nature, and the mingled web of free and restricted
natural forces, man feels himself raised to a height from whence, as he
embraces the vast horizon, individual things blend together in varied
groups, and appear as if shrouded in a vapory
 vail.  These figurative expressions are used in order to illustrate the
point of view from whence we would consider the universe both in its
celestial and terrestrial sphere.  I am not insensible of the boldness of
such an undertaking.  Among all the forms of exposition to which these pages
are devoted, there is none more difficult than the general delineation of
nature, which we purpose sketching, since we must not allow ourselves to be
overpowered by a sense of the stupendous richness and variety of the forms
presented to us, but must dwell only on the consideration of masses either
possessing actual magnitude, or borrowing its semblance from the
associations awakened within the subjective sphere of ideas.  It is by a
separation and classification of phenomena by an intuitive insight into the
play of obscure forces, and by animated expressions, in which the
perceptible spectacle is reflected with vivid truthfulness, that we may hope
to comprehend and describe the 'universal all' [Greek words] in a manner
worthy of the dignity of the word 'Cosmos' in its signification of
'universe, order of the world', and 'adornment' of this universal order.
May the immeasurable diversity of phenomena which crowd into the picture of
nature in no way detract from that harmonious impression of rest and unity
which is the ultimate object of every literary or purely artistical
composition.

Beginning with the depths of space and the regions of remotest nebulae, we will gradually descend
through the starry zone to which our solar system belongs, to our own terrestrial spheroid,
circled by air and ocean, there to direct our attention p 80 to its form, temperature, and
magnetic tension, and to consider the fullness of organic life unfolding itself upon its surface
beneath the vivifying influence of light.  In this manner a picture of the world may, with
a few strokes, be made to include the realms of infinity no less than the minute microscopic
animal and vegetable organisms which exist in standing waters and on the weather-beaten surface
of our rocks.  All that can be perceived by the senses, and all that has been accumulated up
to the present day by an attentive and variously directed study of nature, constitute the materials
from which this representation is to be drawn, whose character is an evidence of its fidelity
and truth.  But the descriptive picture of nature which we purpose drawing must not enter too
fully into detail, since a minute enumeration of all vital forms, natural objects, and processes
is not requisite to the completeness of the undertaking.  The delineator of nature must resist
the tendency toward endless division, in order to avoid the dangers presented by the very abundance
of our empirical knowledge.  A considerable portion of the qualitative properties of matter
-- or, to speak more in accordance with the language of natural philosophy, of the qualitative
expression of forces -- is doubtlessly still unknown to us, and the attempt perfectly to represent
unity in diversity must therefore necessarily prove unsuccessful.  Thus, besides the pleasure
derived and tinged with a shade of sadness, an unsatisfied longing for something beyond the
present -- a striving toward regions yet unknown and unopened.  Such a sense of longing binds
still faster the links which, in accordance with the supreme laws of our being, connect the
material with the ideal world, and animates the mysterious relation existing between that which
the mind receives from without, and that which it reflects from its own depths to the external
world.  If, then, nature (understanding by the term all natural objects and phenomena) be illimitable
in extent and contents, it likewise presents itself to the human intellect as a problem which
can not be grasped, and whose solution is impossible, since it requires a knowledge of the
combined action of all natural forces.  Such an acknowledgement is due where the actual state
and prospective development of phenomena constitute the sole objects of direct investigation,
which does not venture to depart from the strict rules of induction.  But, although the incessant
effort to embrace nature in its universality may remain unsatisfied, the history of the contemplation
of the universe (which p 81 will be considered in another part of this work) will teach us
how, in the course of ages, mankind has gradually attained to a partial insight into the relative
dependence of phenomena.  My duty is to depict the results of our knowledge in all their bearings
with reference to the present.  In all that is subject to motion and change in space, the ultimate
aim, the very expression of physical laws, depend upon 'mean numerical values', which show
us the constant amid change, and the stable amid apparent fluctuations of phenomena.  Thus
the progress of modern physical science is especially characterized by the attainment and the
rectification of the mean values of certain quantities by means of the processes of weighing
and measuring; and it may be said, that the only remaining and widely-diffused hieroglyphic
characters still in our writing -- 'numbers' -- appear to us again, as powers of the Cosmos,
although in a wider sense than that applied to them by the Italian School.

The earnest investigator delights in the simplicity of numerical relations, indicating the
dimensions of the celestial regions, the magnitudes and periodical disturbances of the heavenly
bodies, the triple elements of terrestrial magnetism, the mean pressure of the atmosphere,
and the quantity of heat which the sun imparts in each year, and in every season of the year,
to all points of the solid and liquid surface of our planet.  These sources of enjoyment do
not, however, satisfy the poet of Nature, or the mind of the inquiring many.  To both of these
the present state of science appears as a blank, now that she answers doubtingly, or wholly
rejects as unanswerable, questions to which former ages deemed they could furnish satisfactory
replies.  In her severer aspect, and clothed with less luxuriance, she shows herself deprived
of that seductive charm with which a dogmatizing and symbolizing physical philosophy knew how
to deceive the understanding and give the rein to imagination.  Long before the discovery of
the New World, it was believed that new lands in the Far West might be seen from the shores
of the Canaries and the Azores.  These illusive images were owing, not to any extraordinary
refraction of the rays of light, but produced by an eager longing for the distant and the unattained.
The philosophy of the Greeks, the physical views of the Middle Ages, and even those of a more
recent period, have been eminently imbued with the charm springing from similar illusive phantoms
of the imagination.  At the limits of circumscribed knowledge, as from some lofty island shore,
the eye delights to penetrate p 82 to distant regions.  The belief in the uncommon and the
wonderful lends a definite outline to every manifestation of ideal creation; and the realm
of fancy -- a fairy-land of cosmological, geognostical, and magnetic visions -- becomes thus
involuntarily blended with the domain of reality.

Nature, in the manifold signification of the word -- whether considered as the universality
of all that is and ever will be -- as the inner moving force of all phenomena, or as their
mysterious prototype -- reveals itself to the simple mind and feelings of man as something
earthly, and closely allied to himself.  It is only within the animated circles of organic
structure that we feel ourselves peculiarly at home.  Thus, wherever the earth unfolds her
fruits and flowers, and gives food to countless tribes of animals, there the image of nature
impresses itself most vividly upon our senses.  The impression thus produced upon our minds
limits itself almost exclusively to the reflection of the earthly.  The starry vault and the
wide expanse of the heavens belong to a picture of the universe, in which the magnitude of
masses, the number of congregated suns and faintly glimmering nebulae, although they excite
our wonder and astonishment, manifest themselves to us in apparent isolation, and as utterly
devoid of all evidence of their being the scenes of organic life.  Thus, even in the earliest
physical views of mankind, heaven and earth have been separated and opposed to one another
as an upper and lower portion of space.  If, then, a picture of nature were to correspond to
the requirements of contemplation by the senses, it ought to begin with a delineation of our
native earth.  It should depict, first, the terrestrial planet as to its size and form; its
increasing density and heat at increasing depths in its superimposed solid and liquid strate;
the separation of sea and land, and the vital forms animating both, developed in the cellular
tissues of plants and animals; the atmospheric ocean, with its waves and currents, through
which pierce the forest-crowned summits of our mountain chains.  After this delineation of
purely telluric relations, the eye would rise to the celestial regions, and the Earth would
then, as the well-known seat of organic development, be considered as a planet, occupying a
place in the series of those heavenly bodies which circle round one of the innumerable host
of self-luminous stars.  This succession of ideas indicates the course pursued in the earliest
stages of perceptive contemplation, and reminds us of the ancient conception of the "sea-girt
disk of earth," supporting the vault of heaven. It begins to exercise in action p 83 at the
spot where it originated, and passes from the consideration of the known to the unknown, of
the near to the distant.  It corresponds with the method pursued in our elementary works on
astronomy (and which is so admirable in a mathematical point of view), of proceeding from the
apparent to the real movements of the heavenly bodies.

Another course of ideas must, however, be pursued in a work which proposes merely to give an
exposition of what is known -- of what may in the present state of our knowledge be regarded
as certain, or as merely probable in a greater or lesser degree -- and does not enter into
a consideration of the proofs on which such results have been based.  Here, therefore, we do
not proceed from the subjective point of view of human interests.  The terrestrial must be
treated only as grand and free, uninfluenced by motives of proximity, social sympathy, or relative
utility.  A physical cosmography -- a picture of the universe -- does not begin, therefore,
with the picture of the universe -- does not begin, therefore, with the terrestrial, but with
that which fills the regions of space.  But as the sphere of contemplation contracts in dimension
our perception of the richness of individual parts, the fullness of physical phenomena, and
of the heterogeneous properties of matter becomes enlarged.  From the regions in which we recognize
ony the dominion of the laws of attraction, we descend to our own planet, and to the intricate
play of terrestrial forces.  The method here described for the delineation of nature is opposed
to that which mst be pursued in establishing conclusive results.  The one enumerates what the
other demonstrates.

Man learns to know the external world through the organs of the senses. Phenomena of light
proclaim the existence of matter in remotest space, and the eye is thus made the medium through
which we may contemplate the universe.  The discovery of telescopic vision more than two centuries
ago, has transmitted to latest generations a power whose limits are as yet unattained.

The first and most general consideration of the Cosmos is that of the 'contents of space' --
the distribution of matter, or of creation, as we are wont to designate the assemblage of all
that is and ever will be developed. We see matter either agglomerated into rotating, revolving
spheres of different density and size, or scattered through space in the form of self-luminous
vapor.  If we consider first the cosmical vapor dispersed in definite nebulous spots, its state
of aggregation will p 84 appear constantly to vary, sometimes appearing separated into round
or elliptical disks, single or in pairs, occasionally connected by a thread of light; while,
at another time, these nebulae occur in forms of larger dimensions, and are either elongated,
or variously branched or fan-shaped or appear like well-defined rings, including a dark interior.
It is conjectured that these bodies are undergoing variously developed formative processes,
as the cosmical vapor becomes condensed in conformity with the laws of attraction, either round
one or more of the nuclei.  Between two and three thousand of such unresolvable nebulae, in
which the most powerful telescopes have hitherto been unable to distinguish the presence of
stars, have been counted, and their positions determined.

The genetic evolution -- that perpetual state of development which seems to affect this portion
of the regions of space -- has led philosophical observers to the discovery of the analogy
existing among organic phenomena. As in our forests we see the same kind of tree in all the
various stages of its growth, and are thus enabled to form an idea of progressive, vital development,
so do we also in the great garden of the universe, recognise the most different phases of sidereal
formation.  The process of condensation, which formed a part of the doctrines of Anaximenes
and of the Ionian School, appears to be going on before our eyes.  This subject of investigation
and conjecture is especially attractive to the imagination, for in the study of the animated
circles of nature, and of the action of all the moving forces of the universe, the charm that
exercises the most powerful influence on the mind is derived less from a knowledge of that
which 'is' than from a perception of that which 'will be', even though the latter be nothing
more than a new condition of a known material existence; for of actual creation, of origin,
the beginning of existence from non-existence, we have no experience, and can therefore form
no conception.

A comparison of the various causes influencing the development manifested by the greater or
less degree of condensation in the interior of nebulae, no less than a successive course of
direct observations, have led to the belief that changes of form have been recognized first
in Andromeda, next in the constallation Argo, and in the isolated filamentous portion of the
nebula in Orion.  But want of uniformity in the power of the instruments employed, different
conditions of our atmosphere, and other optical relations, render a part of the results invalid
as historical evidence.

p 85 'Nebulous stars' must not be confounded either with irregularly-shaped nebulous spots,
properly so called, whose separate parts have an unequal degree of brightness (and which may,
perhaps, become concentrated into stars as their circumference contracts), nor with the so-called
planetary nebulae, whose circular or slightly oval disks manifest in all their parts a perfectly
uniform degree of faint light.  'Nebulous stars' are not merely accidental bodies projected
upon a nebulous ground, but are a part of the nebulous matter constituting one mass with the
body which it surrounds.  The not unfrequently considerable magnitude of their apparent diameter,
and the remote distance from which they are revealed to us, show that both the planetary nebulae
and the nebulous stars must be of enormous dimensions. New and ingenious considerations of
the different influence exercised by distance* on the intensity of light of a disk of appreciable
diameter, and of a single self-luminous point, render it not improbable that the planetary
nebulae are very remote nebulous stars, in which the difference between the central body and
the surrounding nebulous covering can no longer be detected by our telescopic instruments.

The magnificent zones of the southern heavens, between 50 degrees and 80 degrees, are especially
rich in nebulous stars, and in compressed unresolvable nebua e.  The larger of the two Magellanic
clouds, which circle round the starless, desert pole of the south, appears, according to the
most recent researches,* as "a collection of clusters of stars, composed of globular clusters
and nebulae of different magnitude, and of large nebulous spots

p 86 not resolvable, which, producing a general brightness in the field of view, form, as it
were, the back-ground of the picture."

[footnote]  *The two Magellanic clouds, Nubecula major and Nubecula minor, are very remarkable
objects.  The larger of the two is an accumulated mass of stars, and consists of clusters of
stars of irregular form, either conical masses or nebulae of different magnitudes and degrees
of condensation.  This is interspersed with nebulous spots, not resolvable into stars, but
which are probably 'star dust', appearing only as a general radiance upon the telescopic field
of a twenty-feet reflector, and forming a luminous ground on which other objects of striking
and indescribable form are scattered.  In no other portion of the heavens are so many nebulous
and stellar masses thronged together in an equally small space.  Nubecula minor is much less
beautiful, has more unresolvable nebulous light, while the stellar masses are fewer and fainter
in intensity. -- (From a letter of Sir John Herschel, Feldhuysen, Cape of Good Hope, 13th June,
1836.)

The appearance of these clouds, of the brightly-beaming constellation Argo, of the Milky Way
between Scorpio, the Centaur, and the Southern Cross, the picturesque beauty, if one may so
speak, of the whole expanse of the southern celestial hemisphere, has left upon my mind an
ineffaceable impression.  The zodiacal light, which rises in a pyramidal form, and constantly
contributes, by its mild radiance, to the external beauty of the tropical nights, is either
a vast nebulous ring, rotating between the Earth and Mars, or, less probably, the exterior
stratum of the solar atmosphere. Besides these luminous clouds and nebulae of definite form,
exact and corresponding observations indicate the existence and the general distribution of
an apparently non-luminous, infinitely-divided matter, which posssesses a force of resistance
and manifests its presence in Encke's, and perhaps also in Biela's comet, by diminishing their
eccentricity and shortening their period of revolution.  Of this impending, ethereal, and cosmical
matter, it may be supposed that it is in motion; that it gravitates, notwithstanding its original
tenuity; that it is condensed in the vicinity of the great mass of the Sun; and, finally, that
it may, for myriads of ages, have been augmented by the vapor emanating from the tails of comets.

If we now pass from the consideration of the vaporous matter of the immeasurable regions of
space [(Greek)*] -- whether scattered without definite form and limits, it exists as a cosmical
other, or is condensed into nebulous spots, and becomes comprised among the solid agglomerated
bodies of the universe -- we approach a class of phenomena exclusively designated by the form
of stars, or as the sidereal world.

[footnote]  *I should have made use, in the place of garden of the universe, of the beautiful
expression [Greek], borrowed by Hesychius from an unknown poet, if [Greek] had not rather signified
in general an inclosed space.  The connection with the German 'garten' and the English 'garden',
'gards' in Gothic (derived according to Jacob Grimm, from 'gairdan', 'to gird'), is, however,
evident, as is likewise the affinity with the Slavonic 'grad', 'gorod', and as Pott remarks,
in his 'Etymol. Forschungen', th. i., s. 144 (Etymol. Researches), with the Latin 'chors',
whence we have the Spanish 'corte', the French 'cour', and the English word 'court', together
with the Ossetic 'khart'.  To these may be further added the Scandinavian 'gard',** 'gard',
a place inclosed, as a court, or a country seat, and the Persian 'gerd', 'gird', a district,
a circle, a princely country seat, a castle or city, as we find the term applied to the names
of places in Firdusi's Schahnameh, as 'Siyawakschgird', 'Darabgird', etc.

** (This word is written 'gaard' in the Danish) -- Tr.

p 87 Here, too, we find differences existing in the solidity or density of the spheroidally
agglomerated matter.  Our own solar system presents all stages of 'mean' density (or of the
relation of 'volume' to 'mass'.)  On comparing the planets from Mercury to Mars with the Sun
and with Jupiter, and these two last named with the yet inferior density of Saturn, we arrive,
by a descending scale -- to draw our illustration from the terrestrial substances -- at the
respective densities of antimony, honey, water, and pine wood.  In comets, which actually constitute
the most considerable portion of our solar system with respect to the number of individual
forms, the concentrated part, usually termed the 'head', or 'nucleus', transmits sidereal light
unimpaired.  The mass of a comet probably in no case equals the five thousandth part of that
of the earth, so dissimilar are the formative processes manifested in the original and perhaps
still progressive agglomerations of matter.  In proceeding from general to special considerations,
it was particularly desirable to draw attention to this diversity, not merely as a possible,
but as an actually proved fact.

The purely speculative conclusions arrived at by Wright, Kant, and Lambert,
concerning the general structural arrangement of the universe, and of the
distribution of matter in space, have been confirmed by Sir William
Herschel, on the more certain path of observation and measurement.  That
great and enthusiastic, although cautious observer, was the first to sound
the depths of heaven in order to determine the limits and form of the starry
stratum which we inhabit, and he, too, was the first who ventured to throw
the light of investigation upon the relations existing between the position
and distance of remote nebulae and our own portion of the sidereal universe.
 William Herschel, as is well expressed in the elegant inscription on his
monument at Upton, broke through the inclosures of heaven ('caelorum
perrupit claustra'), and, like another Columbus, penetrated into an unknown
ocean, from which he beheld coasts and groups of islands, whose true
position it remains for future ages to determine.

Considerations regarding the different intensity of light in stars, and their relative number,
that is to say, their numerical frequency on telescopic fields of equal magnitude, have led
to the assumption of unequal distances and distribution in space in the strata which they compose.
Such assumptions, in as far as they may lead us to draw the limits of the individual portions
of the universe, can not offer the same degree of mathematical certainty as that which may
be attained in all that p 88 relates to our solar system, whether we consider the rotation
of double stars with unequal velocity round one common center of gravity, or the apparent or
true movements of all the heavenly bodies.  If we take up the physical description of the universe
from the remotest nebulae, we may be inclined to compare it with the mythical portions of history.
The one begins in the obscurity of antiquity, the other in that of inaccessible space; and
at the point where reality seems to flee before us, imagination becomes doubly incited to draw
from its own fullness, and give definite outline and permanence to the changing forms of objects.

If we compare the regions of the universe with one of the island-studded seas of our own planet,
we may imagine matter to be distributed in groups, either as unresolvable nebulae of different
ages, condensed around one or more nuclei, or as already agglomerated into clusters of stars,
or isolated spheroidal bodies.  The cluster of stars, to which our cosmical island belongs,
forms a lens-shaped, flattened stratum, detached on every side, whose major axis is estimated
at seven or eight hundred, and its minor one at a hundred and fifty times the distance of Sirius.
It would appear, on the supposition that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than that accurately
determined for the brightest star in the Centaur (0".9128), that light traverses one distance
of Sirius in three years, while it also follows, from Bessel's earlier excellent Memoir* on
the parallax of the remarkable star 61 Cygni (0".3483), (whose considerable motion might lead
to the inference of great proximity), that a period of nine years and a quarter is required
for the transmission of light from this star to our planet.

[footnote]  *See Maclear's "Results from 1839 to 1840," in the 'Trans. of the Astronomical
Soc.', vol. xii., p. 370, on 'a' Centauri, the probable mean error being 0".0649.  For 61 Cygni,
see Bessel, in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch', 1839, s. 47, and Schumacher's 'Astron. Nachr.', bd.
xviii., s. 401, 402, probable mean error, 0".0141.  With reference to the relative distances
of stars of different magnitudes, how those of the third magnitude may probably be three times
more remote, and the manner in which we represent to ourselves the material arrangement of
the starry strata, I have found the following remarkable passage in Kepler's 'Epitome Astronomiae
Copernicanae', 1618, t. i., lib. 1, p. 34-39:  "Sol hic noster nil aliud est quam una ex fixis,
nobis major et clarior visa, quia propior quam fixa. Pone terram stare ad latus, una semi-diametro
via e lactea e, tunc ha ec via lactea apparebit circulus parvus, vel ellipsis parva, tota declinans
ad latus alterum; eritque simul uno intuitu conspicua, quae nunc no potest nisi dimidia conspici
quovis momento.  Itaque fix arum spha era non tantum orbe stellarum, sed etiam circulo lactis
versus not deorsum est terminata."

Our starry stratum is a disk of inconsiderable thickness, divided a p 89 third of its length
into two branches; it is supposed that we are near this division, and nearer to the region
of Sirius than to the constellation Aquila, almost in the middle of the stratum in the line
of its thickness or minor axis.

This position of our solar system, and the form of the whole discoidal stratum, have been inferred
from sidereal scales, that is to say, from that method of counting the stars to which I have
already alluded, and which is based upon the equidistant subdivision of the telescopic field
of view.  The relative depth of the stratum in all directions is measured by the greater or
smaller number of stars appearing in each division.  These divisions give the length of the
ray of vision in the same manner as we measure the depth to which the plummet has been thrown,
before it reaches the bottom, although in the case of a starry stratum there can not, correctly
speaking, be any idea of depth, but merely of outer limits.  In the direction of the longer
axis, where the stars lie behind one another, the more remote ones appear closely crowded together,
united, as it were, by a milky-white radiance or luminous vapor, and are perspectively grouped,
encircling as in a zone, the visible vault of heaven.  This narrow and branched girdle, studded
with a radiant light, and here and there interrupted by dark spots, deviates only by a few
degrees from forming a perfect large circle round the concave sphere of heaven, owing to our
being near the center of the large starry cluster, and almost on the plane of the Milky Way.
If our planetary system were far 'outside' this cluster, the Milky Way would appear to telescopic
vision as a ring, and at a still greater distance as a resolvable discoidal nebula.

Among the many self-luminous moving suns, erroneously called 'fixed stars', which constitute
our cosmical island, our own sun is the only one known by direct observation to be a 'central
body' in its relations to spherical agglomerations of matter directly depending upon and revolving
round it, either in the form of planets, comets, or aerolite asteroids.  As far as we have
hitherto been able to investigate 'multiple' stars (double stars or suns), these bodies are
not subject, with respect to relative motion and illumination, to the same planetary dependence
that characterizes our own solar system.  Two or more self-luminous bodies, whose planets and
moon, if such exist, have hitherto escaped our telescopic powers of vision, certainly revolve
around one common center of gravity; but this is in a portion of space which is probably occupied
merely by unagglomerated matter or cosmical vapor, while in our system p 90 the center of gravity
is often comprised within the innermost limits of a 'visible' central body.  If, therefore,
we regard the Sun and the Earth, or the Earth and the Moon, as double-stars, and the whole
of our planetary solar system as a multiple cluster of stars, the analogy thus suggested must
be limited to the universality of the laws of attraction in different systems, being alike
applicable to the independent processes of light and to the method of illumination.

For the generalization of cosmical views, corresponding with the plan we have proposed to follow
in giving a delineation of nature or of the universe, the solar system to which the Earth belongs
may be considered in a two-fold relation:  first, with respect to the different classes of
individually agglomerated matter, and the relative size, conformation, density, and distance
of the heavenly bodies of this system; and secondly, with reference to other portions of our
starry cluster, and of the changes of position of its central body, the Sun.

The solar system, that is to say, the variously-formed matter circling round the Sun, consists,
according to the present state of our knowledge of 'eleven primary planets',* eighteen satellites
p 91 or secondary planets, and myriads of comets, three of which, known as the "planetary comets,"
do not pass beyond the narrow limits of the orbits described by the principal planets.

[footnote]  * (Since the publication of Baron Humboldt's work in 1845, several other planets
have been discovered, making the number of those belonging to our planetary system 'sixteen'
instead of 'eleven'.  Of these, Astrea, Hebe, Flora, and Iris are members of the remarkable
group of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter.  Astrea and Hebe were discovered by Hencke at
Driesen, the one in 1846 and the other in 1847; Flora and Iris were both discovered in 1847
by Mr. Hind, at the South Villa Observatory, Regent's Park.  It would appear from the latest
determinations of their elements, that the small planets have the following order with respect
to mean distance from the Sun:  Flora, Iris, Vesta, Hebe, Astrea, Juno, Ceres, Pallas.  Of
these, Flora has the shortest period (about 3 1/4 years).  The planet Neptune, which, after
having been predicted by several astronomers, was actually observed on the 25th of September,
1846, is situated on the confines of our planetary system beyond Uranus.  The discovery of
this planet is not only highly interesting from the importance attached to it as a question
of science, but also from the evidence it affords of the care and unremitting labor evinced
by modern astronomers in the investigation and comparison of the older calculations, and the
ingenious application of the results thus obtained to the observation of new facts.  The merit
of having paved the way for the discovery of the planet Neptune is due to M. Bouvard, who,
in his persevering and assiduous efforts to deduce the entire orbit of Uranus from observations
made during the forty years that succeeded the discovery of that planet in 1781, found the
results yielded by theory to be at variance with fact, in a degree that had no parallel in
the history of astronomy.  This startling discrepancy, which seemed only to gain additional
weight from every attempt made by M. Bouvard to correct his calculations, led Leverrier, after
a careful modification of the tables of Bouvard, to establish the proposition that there was
"a formal incompatibility between the observed motions of Uranus and the hypothesis that he
was acted on 'only' by the Sun and known planets, according to the law of universal gravitation."
Pursuing this idea, Leverrier arrived at the conclusion that the disturbing cause must be a
'planet', and finally, after an amount of labor that seems perfectly overwhelming, he, on the
31st of August, 1846, laid before the French Institute a paper, in which he indicated the exact
spot in the heavens where this new planetary body would be found, giving the following data
for its various elements:  mean distance from the Sun, 36.154 times that of the Earth; period
of revolution, 217.387 years; mean long., Jan. 1st, 1847, 318 degrees 47'; mass, 1/9300th;
heliocentric long., Jan 1st1847, 326 degrees 32'.  Essential difficulties still intervened,
however, and as the remoteness of the planet rendered it improbable that its disk would be
discernible by any telescopic instrument, no other means remained for detecting the suspected
body but its planetary motion, which could only be ascertained by mapping, after every observation,
the quarter of the heavens scanned, and by a comparison of the various maps.  Fortunately for
the verification of Leverrier's predictions, Dr. Bremiker had just completed a map of the precise
region in which it was expected the new planet would apper, this being one of a series of maps
made for the Academy of Berlin, of the small stars along the entire zodiac.  By means of this
valuable assistance, Dr. Galle, of the Berlin Observatory, was led, on the 25th of September,
1846, by the discovery of a star of the eighth magnitude, not recorded in Dr. Bremiker's map,
to make the first observation of the planet predicted by Leverrier.  By a singular coincidence,
Mr. Adams, of Cambridge, had predicted the appearance of the planet simultaneously with M.
Leverrier; but by the concurrence of several circumstances much to be regretted, the world
at large were not made acquainted with Mr. Adams's valuable discovery until subsequently to
the period at which Leverrier published his observations.  As the data of Leverrier and Adams
stand at present, there is a discrepancy between the predicted and the true distance, and in
some other elements of the planet; it remains therefore, for these or future astronomers to
reconcile theory with fact, or perhaps, as in the case of Uranus, to make the new planet the
means of leading to yet greater discoveries.  It would appear from the most recent observations,
that the mass of Neptune, instead of being, as at first stated, 1/9300th, is only about 1/23000th
that of the Sun, while its periodic time is now given with a greater probability at 166 years,
and its mean distance from the Sun nearly 30.  The planet appears to have a ring, but as yet
no accurate observations have been made regarding its system of satellites.  See 'Trans. Astron.
Soc.', and 'The Planet Neptune', 1848, by J. P. Nicholl.) -- Tr.

We may, with no incondsiderable degree of probability, include within the domain of our Sun,
in the immediate sphere of its central force, a rotating ring of vaporous matter, lying probably
between the orbits of Venus and Mars, but certainly beyond that of the Earth,* which appears
to us in p 92 a pyramidal form, and is known as the 'Zodiacal Light'; and a host of very small
asteroids, whose orbits either intersect, or very nearly approach, that of our earth, and which
present us with the phenomena of aerolites and falling or shooting stars.

[footnote]  * "If there should be molecules in the zones diffused by the atmosphere of the
Sun of too volatile a nature either to combine with one another or with the planets, we must
suppose that they would, in circling round that luminary, present all the appearances of zodiacal
light, without opposing any appreciable resistance to the different bodies composing the planetary
system, either owing to their extreme rarity, or to the similarity existing between their motion
and that of the planets with which they come in contact." -- Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde'
(ed. 5), p. 415.

When we consider the complication of variously-formed bodies which revolve round the Sun in
orbits of such dissimilar eccentricity--although we may not be disposed, with the immortal
author of the 'Mecanique Celeste', to regard the largr number of comets as nebulous stars,
passing from one central system to another,* we yet can not fail to acknowledge that the planetary
system, especially so called (that is, the group of heavenly bodies which, together with their
satellites, revolve with but slightly eccentric orbits round the Sun), constitutes but a small
portion of the whole system with respect to individual numbers, if not to mass.

[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Exp. du Syst. du Monde', p. 396, 414.

It has been proposed to consider the telescopic planets, Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, with
their more closely intersecting, inclined, and eccentric orbits, as a zone of separation, or
as a middle group in space; and if this view be adopted, we shall discover that the interior
planetary group (consisting of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars) presents several very striking
contrasts* when compared with the exterior group, comprising Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.

[footnote] *Littrow, 'Astronomie', 1825, bd.xi., 107.  Mdler, 'Astron.', 1841, ¤ 212.  Laplace,
'Exp. du Syst. du Monde', p. 210.

The planets nearest the Sun, and consequently included in the inner group, are of more moderate
size, denser, rotate more slowly and with nearly equal velocity (their periods of revolution
being almost all about 24 hours), are less compressed at the poles, and with the exception
of one, are without satellites.  The exterior planets, which are further removed from the Sun,
are very considerably larger, have a density five times less, more than twice as great a velocity
in the period of their rotation round their axes, are more compressed at the poles, and if
six satellites may be ascribed to Uranus, have a quantitative preponderance in the number of
their attendant moons, which is as seventeen to one.

p 93 Such general considerations regarding certain characteristic properties appertaining to
whole groups, can not, however, be applied with equal justice to the individual planets of
every group, nor to the relations between the distances of the revolving planets from the central
body, and their absolute size, density, period or rotation, eccentricity, and the inclination
of their orbits and the axes.  We know as yet of no inherent necessity,  no mechanical natural
law, similar to the one which teaches us that the squares of the periodic times are proportional
to the cubes of the major axes, by which the above-named six elements of the planetary bodies
and the form of their orbit are made dependent either on one another, or on their mean distance
from the Sun.  Mars is smaller than the Earth and Venus, although further removed from the
Sun than these last-named planets, approaching most nearly in size to Mercury, the nearest
planet to the Sun. Saturn is smaller than Jupiter, and yet much larger than Uranus.  The zone
of the telescopic planets, which have so inconsiderable a volume, immediately procede Jupiter
(the greatest in size of any of the planetary bodies), if we consider them with regard to distance
from the Sun; and yet the disks of these small asteroids, which scarcely admit of measurement,
have an areal surface not much more than half that of France, Madagascar, or Borneo.  However
striking may be the extremely small density of all the colossal planets, which are furthest
removed from the Sun, we are yet unable in this respect to recognize any regular succession.*

[footnote] *See Kepler, on the increasing density and volume of the planets
in proportion with their increase of distance from the Sun, which is
described as the densest of all the heavenly bodies; in the 'Epitome Astran.
Copern. in' vii. 'libros digesta', 1618-1622, p. 420.  Leibnitz also
inclined to the opinions of Kepler and Otto von Guericke, that the planets
increase in volume in proportion to their increase of distance from the Sun.
 See his letter to the Magdeburg Burgomaster (Mayence, 1671), in Leibnitz,
'Deutschen Schriften, herausg. von Guhrauer', th. i., 264.

Uranus appears to be denser than Saturn, even if we adopt the smaller mass, 1/24605, assumed
by Lamont; and, notwithstanding the inconsiderable difference of density observed in the innermost
planetary group,* we find both Venus and Mars less dense than the Earth, which lies between them.

[footnote] *On the arrangement of masses, see Encke, in Schum., 'Astr. Nachr', 1843 Nr. 488, 114.

The time of rotation certainly diminishes with increasing solar distance, but yet it is greater
in Mars than in the Earth, and in Saturn than in Jupiter.  The elliptic p 94 orbits of Juno,
Pallas, and Mercury have the greatest degree of eccentricity, and Mars and Venus, which immediately
follow each other, have the least.  Mercury and Venus exhibit the same contrasts that may be
observed in the four smaller planets, or asteroids, whose paths are so closely interwoven.

The eccentriciities of Juno and Pallas are very nearly identical, and reach three times as
great as those of Ceres and Vesta.  The same may be said of the inclination of the orbits of
the planets toward the plane of projection of the ecliptic, or in the position of their axes
of rotation with relation to their orbits, a position on which the relations of climate, seasons
of the year, and length of the days depend more than on eccentricity.  Those planets that have
the most elongated elliptic orbits, as Juno, Pallas, and Mercury, have also, although not to
the same degree their orbits most strongly inclined toward the ecliptic.  Pallas has a comet-like
inclination nearly twenty-six times greater than that of Jupiter, while in the little planet
Vesta, which is so near Pallas, the angle of inclination scarcely by six times exceeds that
of Jupiter.  An equally irregular succession is observed in the position of the axes of the
few planets (four or five) whose planes of rotation we know with any degree of certainty. 
It would appear from the position of the satellites of Uranus, two of which, the second and
fourth, have been recently observed with certainty, that the axis of this, the outermost of
all the planets is scarcely inclined as much as 11 degrees toward the plane of its orbit, while
Saturn is placed between this planet, whose axis almost coincides with the plane of its orbit,
and Jupiter, whose axis of rotation is nearly perpendicular to it.

In this enumeration of the forms which compose the world in space, we have delineated them
as possessing an actual existence, and not as objects of intellectual contemplation, or as
mere links of a mental and causal chain of connection.  The planetary system, in its relations
of absolute size and relative position of the axes, density, time of rotation, and different
degrees of eccentricity of the orbits, does not appear to offer to our apprehension any stronger
evidence of a natural necessity than the proportion observed in the distribution of land and
water on the Earth, the configuration of continents, or the height of mountain chains.  In
these respects we can discover no common law in the regions of space or in the inequalities
of the earth's crust.  They are 'facts' in nature that have arisen from the conflict of manifold
forces acting under unknown p 95 conditions, although man considers as 'accidental' whatever
he is unable to explain in the planetary formation on purely genetic principles.  If the planets
have been formed out of separate rings of vaporous matter revolving round the Sun, we may conjecture
that the different thickness, unequal density, temperature, and electro-magnetic tension of
these rings may have given occasion to the most various agglomerations of matter, in the same
manner as the amount of tangential velocity and small variations in its direction have produced
so great a differencein the forms and inclinations of the elliptic orbits.  Attractions of
mass and laws of gravitation have no doubt exercised an influence here, no less than in the
geognostic relations of the elevations of continents; but we are unable from the present forms
to draw any conclusions regarding the series of conditions through which they have passed.
Even the so-called law of the distances of the planets from the Sun, the law of progression
(which led Kepler to conjecture the existence of a planet supplying the link that was wanting
in the chain of connection between Mars and Jupiter), has been found numerically inexact for
the distances between Mercury, Venus, and the Earth, and a variance with the conception of
a series, owing to the necessity for a supposition in the case of the first member.

The hitherto disscovered principal planets that revolve round our Sun are attended certainly
by fourteen, and probably by eighteen secondary planets (moons or satellites).  The principal
planets are, therefore, themselves the central bodies of subordinate systems.  We seem to recognize
in the fabric of the universe the same process of arrangement so frequently exhibited in the
development of organic life, where we find in the manifold combinations of groups of plants
or animals the same typical form repeated in the 'subordinate classes'.  The secondary planets
or satellites are more frequent in the external region of the planetary system, lying beyond
the intersecting orbits of the smaller planets or asteroids; in the inner region none of the
planets are attended by satellites, with the exception of the Earth, whose moon is relatively
of great magnitude, since its diameter is equal to a fourth of that of the Earth, while the
diameter of the largest of all known secondary planets -- the sixth satellite of Saturn --
is probably about one seventeenth, and the largest of Jupiter's moons, the third, only about
one twenty-sixth part that of the primary planet or central body.  The planets which are attended
by the largest number of satellites are most remote from the Sun, p 96 and are at the same
time the largest, most compressed at the poles, and the least dense.  According to the most
recent measurements of Mdler, Uranus has a greater planetary compression than any other of
the planets, viz., 1/9.92d.  In our Earth and her moon, whose mean distance from one another
amounts to 207,200 miles, we find that the differences of mass* and diameter between the two
are much less considerable than are usually observed to exist between the principal planets
and their attendant satellites, or between bodies of different orders in the solar system.

[footnote]  *If, according to Burckhardt's determination, the Moon's radius be 0.2725 and its
volume 1/49.00th, its density will be 0.5596, or nearly five ninths.  Compare, also, Wilh.
Beer and H. Madler, 'der Mond', 2, 10, and Madler, 'Ast.',  157.  The material contents of
the Moon are, according to Hansen, nearly 1/34th (and dler 1/40.6th) that of the Earth, and
its mass equal to 1/87.73d that of the Earth.  In the largest of Jupiter's moons, the third,
the relations of volume to the central body are 1/15370th, and of mass 1/11300th.  On the polar
flattening of Uranus, see Schum, 'Astron. Nachr.', 1844, No. 493.

While the density of the Moon is five ninths less than that of the Earth, it would appear,
if we may sufficiently depend upon the determinations of their magnitudes and masses, that
the second of Jupiter's moons is actually denser than that great planet itself.  Among the
fourteen satellites that have been investigated with any degree of certainty, the system of
the seven satellites of Saturn presents an instance of the greatest possible contrast, both
in absolute magnitude and in distance from the central body.  The sixth of these satellites
is probably not much smaller than Mars, while our moon has a diameter which does not amount
to more than half that of the latter planet.  With respect to volume, the two outer, the sixth
and seventh of Saturn's satellites, approach the nearest to the third and brightest of Jupiter's
moons.  The two innermost of these satellites belong perhaps, together with the remote moons
of Uranus to the smallest cosmical bodies of our solar system, being only made visible under
favorable circumstances by the most powerful instruments.  They were first discovered by the
forty-foot telescope of William Herschel in 1789, and were seen again by John Herschel at the
Cape of Good Hope, by Vico at Rome, and by Lamont at Munich. Determinations of the 'true' diameter
of satellites, made by the measurement of the apparent size of their small disks, are subjected
to many optical difficulties; but numerical astronomy, whose task it is to predetermine by
calculation the motions of the heavenly bodies as they will appear when viewed from the Earth,
is directed almost p 97 exclusively to motion and mass, and but little to volume.  The absolute
distance of a satellite from its central body is greatest in the case of the outermost or seventh
satellite of Saturn, its distance from the body round which it revolves amounting to more than
two millions of miles, or ten times as great a distance as that of our moon from the Earth.
In the case of Jupiter we find that the outermost or fourth attendant moon is only 1,040,000
miles from that planet, while the distance between Uranus and its sixth satellite (if the latter
really exist) amounts to as much as 1,360,000 miles.  If we compare, in each of these subordinate
systems, the volume of the satellite, we discover the existence of entirely new numerical relations.
The distances of the outermost satellites of Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter are when expressed
in semi-diameters of the main planets, as 91, 64, and 27.  The outermost satellite of Saturn
appears, therefore, to be removed only about one fifteenth further from the center of that
planet than our moon is from the Earth.  The first or innermost of Saturn's satellites is nearer
to its central body than any other of the secondary planets, and presents, moreover, the only
instance of a period of revolution of less than twenty-four hours.  Its distance from the center
of Saturn may, according to Mdler and Wilhelm Beer, be expressed as 2.47 semi-diameters of
that planet, or as 80,088 miles.  Its distance from the surface of the main planet is therefore
47,480 miles, and from the outer-most edge of the ring only 4916 miles.  The traveler may form
to himself an estimate of the smallness of this amount by remembering the statement of an enterprising
navigator, Captain Beechey, that he had in three years passed over 72,800 miles.  If, instead
of absolute distances, we take the semi-diameters of the principal planets, we shall find that
even the first or nearest of the moons of Jupiter (which is 26,000 miles further removed from
the center of that planet than our moon is from that of the Earth) is only six semi-diameters
of Jupiter from its center, while our moon is removed from us fully 60 1/3d semi-diameters
of the Earth.

In the subordinate systems of satellites, we find that the same laws of gravitation which regulate
the revolutions of the principal planets round the Sun likewise govern the mutual relations
existing between these planets among one another and with reference to their attendant satellites.
The twelve moons of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Earth all most like the primary planets from west
to east, and in elliptic orbits, deviating p 98 but little from circles.  It is only in the
case of one moon, and perhaps in that of the first and innermost of the satellites of Saturn
(0.068), that we discover an eccentricity greater than that of Jupiter; according to the very
exact observations of Bessel, the eccentricity of the sixth of Saturn's satellites (0.029)
exceeds that of the Earth.  On the extremest limits of the planetary system, where, at a distance
nineteen times greater than that of our Earth, the centripetal force of the Sun is greatly
diminished, the satellites of Uranus (which most striking contrasts from the facts observed
with regard to other secondary planets.  Instead, as in all other satellites, of having their
orbits but slightly inclined toward the ecliptic and (not excepting even Saturn's ring, which
may be regarded as a fusion of agglomerated satellites) moving from west to east, the satellites
of Uranus are almost perpendicular to the ecliptic, and move retrogressively from east to west,
as Sir John Herschel has proved by observations continued during many years.  If the primary
and secondary planets have been formed by the condensation of rotating rings of solar and planetary
atmospheric vapor, there must have existed singular causes of retardation or impediment in
the vaporous rings revolving round Uranus, by which, under the relations with which we are
unacquainted, the revolution of the second and fourth of its satellites was made to assume
a direction opposite to that of the rotation of the central planet.

It seems highly probable that the period of rotation of 'all' secondary planets is equal to
that of their revolution round the main planet, and therefore that they always present to the
latter the same side. Inequalities, occasioned by sight variations in the revolution, give
rise to fluctuations of from 6 degrees to 8 degrees, or to an apparent libration in longitude
as well as in latitude.  Thus, in the case of our moon, we sometimes observe more than the
half of its surface, the eastern and northern edges being more visible at one time, and the
western or southern at another.  By means of this libration* we are enabled to see the annular
mountain Malapert (which occasionally conceals the Moon's south pole), the arctic landscape
round the crater of Gioja, and the large gray plane near Endymion which exceeds in superficial
extent the 'Mare Vaporum'.

Three sevenths of the Moon's surface are entirely p 99 concealed from our observation, and
must always remain so, unless new and unexpected disturbing causes come into play.  These cosmical
relations involuntarily remind us of nearly similar conditions in the intellectual world, where,
in the domain of deep research into the mysteries and the primeval creative forces of nature,
there are regions similarly turned away from us, and apparently unattainable, of which only
a narrow margin has revealed itself, for thousands of years, to the human mind, appearing,
from time to time, either glimmering in true or delusive light.  We have hitherto considered
the primary planets, their satellites, and the concentric rings which belong to one, at least,
of the outermost planets, as products of tangential force, and as closely connected together
by mutual attraction; it therefore now only remains for us to speak of the unnumbered host
of 'comets' which constitute a portion of the cosmical bodies revolving in independent orbits
round the Sun.  If we assume an equable distribution of their orbits, and the limits of their
perihelia, or greatest proximities to the Sun, and the possibility of their remaining invisible
to the inhabitants of the Earth, and base our estimates on the rules of the calculus of probabilities,
we shall obtain as the result an amount of myriads perfectly astonishing.  Kepler, with his
usual animation of expression, said that there were more comets in the regions of space than
fishes in the depths of the ocean.  As yet, however, there are scarcely one hundred and fifty
whose paths have been calculated, if we may assume at six or seven hundred the number of comets
whose appearance and passage through known constellations have been ascertained by more or
less precise observations.  While the so-called classical nations of the West, the Greeks and
Romans, although they may occasionally have indicated the position in which a comet first appeared,
never afford any information regarding its apparent path, the copious literature of the Chinese
(who observed nature carefully, and recorded with accuracy what they saw) contains circumstantial
notices of the constellations through which each comet was observed to pass.  These notices
go back to more than five hundred years before the Christian era, and many of them are still
found to be of value in astronomical observations.*

[footnote]  *The first comets of whose orbits we have any knowledge, and
which were calculated from Chinese observations, are those of 240 (under
Gordian II.), 539 (under Justinian), 565, 568, 574, 837, 1337, and 1385.
See John Russell Hind, in Schum., 'Astron. Nachr.', 1843, No. 498.  While
the comet of 837 (which, according to Du Sejour, continued during
twenty-four hours within a distance of 2,000,000 miles from the Earth)
terrified Louis I. of France to that degree that he busied himself in
building churches and founding monastic establishments, in the hope of
appeasing the evils threatened by its appearance, the Chinese astronomers
made observations on the path of this cosmical body, whose tail extended
over a space of 60 degrees, appearing sometimes single and sometimes
multiple.  The first comet that has been calculated solely from European
observations was that of 1456, known as Halley's comet, from the belief
long, but erroneously, entertained that the period when it was first
observed by that astronomer was its first and only well-attested appearance.
 See Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1836, p. 204, and Langier, 'Comptes Rendus
des Seances de l'Acad.', 1843, t. xvi., 1006.

p 100 Although comets have a smaller mass than any other cosmical bodies -- being, according
to our present knowledge, probably not equal to 1/5000th part of the Earth's mass -- yet they
occupy the largest space, as their tails in several instances extend over many millions of
miles.  The cone of luminous vapor which radiates from them has been found, in some cases (as
in 1680 and 1811), to equal the length of the Earth's distance from the Sun, forming a line
that intersects both the orbits of Venus and Mercury.

Comets exhibit such diversities of form, which appear rather to appertain to the individual
than the class, that a description of one of these "wandering light-clouds," as they were already
called by Xenophanes and Theon of Alexandria, contemporaries of Pappus, can only be applied
with caution to another.  The faintest telescopic comets are generally devoid of visible tails,
and resemble Herschel's nebulous stars.  They appear like circular nebulae of faintly-glimmering
vapor, with the light concentrted toward the middle.  This is the most simple type; but it
can not, however, be regarded as rudimentary, since it might equally be the type of an older
cosmical body, exhausted by exhalation.  In the larger comets we may distinguish both the so-called
"head" or "nucleus," and the single or multiple tail, which is characteristically denominated
by the Chinese astronomers "the brush" ('sui').  The nucleus generally presents no definite
outline, although, in a few rare cases, it appears like a star of the first or second magnitude,
and has even been seen in bright sunshine;* as, p 101 for instance, in the large comets of
1402, 1532, 1577, 1744, and 1843.

[footnote]  *Arago, 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 209, 211.  The phenomenon of the
tail of a comet being visible in bright sunshine, which is recorded of the
comet of 1402, occurred again in the case of the large comet of 1843, whose
nucleus and tail were seen in North America on the 28th of February
(according to the testimony of J. G. Clarke, of Portland, state of Maine),
between 1 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon.(a)  The distance of the very dense
nucleus from the sun's light admitted of being measured with much exactness.
 The nucleus and tail appeared like a very pure white cloud, a darker space
intervening between the tail and the nucleus.  ('Amer. Journ. of Science',
vol. xiv., No. 1, p. 229.)

[footnote]  (a)  [The translator was at New Bedford, Massachusetts, U.S., on the 28th February,
1843, and distinctly saw the comet, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon.  The sky at the time
was intensely blue, and the sun shining with a dazzling brightness unknown in European climates.]
-- Tr

This latter circumstance indicates, in particular individuals, a denser mass, capable of reflecting
light with greater intensity.  Even in Herschel's large telescope, only two comets, that discovered
in Sicily in 1807, and the splendid one of 1811, exhibited well-defined disks;* the one at
an angle of 1 second, and the other at 0.77 seconds, whence the true diameters are assumed
to be 536 and 428 miles.

[footnote] *'Phil. Trans.' for 1808, Part ii., p. 155, and for 1812, Part i., p. 118.  The
diameters found by Herschel for the nuclei were 538 and 428 English miles.  For the magnitudes
of the comets of 1798 and 1805, see Arago, 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 203.

The diameters of the less well-defined nuclei of the comets of 1798 and 1805 did not appear
to exceed 24 or 28 miles.

In several comets that have been investigated with great care, especially in the above-named
one of 1811, which continued visible for so long a period, the nucleus and its nebulous envelope
were entirely separated from the tail by a darker space.  The intensity of light in the nucleus
of comets does not augment toward the center in any uniform degree, brightly shining zones
being in many cases separated by concentric nebulous envelopes.  The tails sometimes appear
single, sometimes, although more rarely, double; and in the comets of 1807 and 1843 the branches
were of different lengths; in one instance (1744) the tail had six branches, the whole forming
an angle of 60 degrees.  The tails have been sometimes straight, sometimes curved, either toward
both sides, or toward the side appearing to us as the exterior (as in 1811), or convex toward
the direction in which the comet is moving (as in that of 1618); and sometimes the tail has
even appeared like a flame in motion.  The tails are always turned away from the sun, so that
their line of prolongation passes through its center; a fact which, according to Edward Biot,
was noticed by the Chinese astronomers as early as 837, but was first generally made known
in Europe by Fracastoro and Peter Apian in the sixteenth century.  These emanations may be
regarded as conoidal envelopes of greater of less thickness, p 102 and, considered in this
manner, they furnish a simple explanation of many of the remarkable optical phenomena already
spoken of.

Comets are not only characteristically different in form, some being entirely without a visible
tail, while others have a tail of immense length (as in the instance of the comet of 1618,
whose tail measured 104 degrees), but we also see the same comets undergoing successive and
rapidly-changing processes of configuration.  These variations of form have been most accurately
and admirably described in the comet of 1744, by Hensius, at St. Petersburg, and in Halley's
comet, on its last reappearance in 1835, by Bessel, at Konigsberg.  A more or less well-defined
tuft of rays emanated from that part of the nucleus which was turned toward the Sun; and the
rays being bent backward, formed a part of the tail.  The nucleus of Halley's comet; with its
emanations, presented the appearance of a burning rocket, the end of which was turned sideways
by the force of the wind.  The rays issuing from the head were seen by Arago and myself, at
the Observatory at Paris, to assume very different forms on successive nights.*

[footnote]  *Arago, 'Des Changements physiques de la Comete de Halley du 15-23 Oct., 1835.
'Annuaire', 1836, p. 218, 221.  The ordinary direction of the emanations was noticed even in
Nero's time.  "Comae radios solis effugiunt." -- Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.', vii., 20.

The great Konigsberg astronomer concluded from many measurements, and from theoretical considerations,
"that the cone of light issuing from the comet deviated considerably both to the right and
the left of the true direction of the Sun, but that it always returned to that direction, and
passed over to the opposite side, so that both the cone of light and the body of the comet
from whence it emanated experienced a rotatory, or, rather, a vibratory motion in the plane
of the orbit."  He finds that "the attractive force exercised by the Sun on heavy bodies is
inadequate to explain such vibrations, and is of opinion that they indicate a polar force,
which turns one semi-diameter of the comet toward the Sun, and strives to turn the opposite
side away from that luminary.  The magnetic polarity possessed by the Earth may present some
analogy to this, and, should the Sun have an opposite polarity, an influence might be manifested,
resulting in the precession of the equinoxes."  This is not the place to enter more fully upon
the grounds on which explanations of this subject have been based; but observations so remarkable,*
and views of so exalted p 103 a character, regarding the most wonderful class of the cosmical
bodies belonging to our solar system, ought not to be entirely passed over in this sketch of
a general picture of nature.

on the beautiful comet of 1811, believed that he had discovered evidences of the rotation of
the nucleus and tail ('Phil. Trans.' for 1812, Part i., p. 140).  Dunlop, at Paramatta thought
the same with reference to the third comet of 1825.

Although, as a rule, the tails of comets increase in magnitude and brilliancy in the vicinity
of the sun, and are directed away from that central body, yet the comet of 1823 offered the
remarkable example of two tails, one of which was turned toward the sun, and the other away
from it, forming with each other an angle of 160 degrees.  Modifications of polarity and the
unequal manner of its distribution, and of the direction in which it is conducted, may in this
rare instance have occasioned a double, unchecked, continuous emanation of nebulous matter.*

Aristotle, in his 'Natural Philosophy', makes these emanations the means of bringing the phenomena
of comets into a singular connection with the existence of the Milky Way.  According to his
views, the innumerable quantity of stars which compose this starry zone give out a self-luminous,
incandescent matter.  The nebulous belt which separates the different portions of the vault
of heaven was therefore regarded by the Stagirite as a large comet, the substance of which
was incessantly being renewed.*

'Phil. des Aristoteles', bd. ii., s. 86.  Since Aristotle exercised so great an influence throughout
the whole of the Middle Ages, it is very much to be regretted that he was so averse to those
grander views of the elder Pythagoreans, which inculcated ideas so nearly approximating to
truth respecting the structure of the universe.  He asserts that comets are transitory meteors
belonging to our atmosphere in the very book in which he cites the opinion of the Pythagorean
school, according to which these cosmical bodies are supposed to be planets having long periods
of revolution.  (Aristot., i., 6, 2.)  This Pythagorean doctrine, which, according to the testimony
of Apollonius Myndius, was still more ancient, having originated with the Chaldeans, passed
over to the Romans, who in this instance, as was their usual practice, were merely the copiers
of others. The Myndian philosopher describes the path of comets as directed toward the upper
and remote regions of heaven.  Hence Seneca says, in his 'Nat. Quaest.', vii., 17:  "Cometes
non est species falsa, sed proprium sidus sicut solis et lunae:  altiora mundi secat et tunc
demum apparet quum in imum cursum sui venit;" and again (at vii., 27), "Cometes aternos esse
et sortis ejusdem, cujus caetera (sidera), etiamsi faciem illis non habent similem."  Pliny
(ii., 25) also refers to Apollonius Myndius, when he says, "Sunt qui et haec sidera perpetua
esse credant suoque ambitu ire, sed non nisi relicta a sole cerni."

p 104 The occulation of the fixed stars by the nucleus of a comet, or by its innermost vaporous
envelopes, might throw some light on the physical character of these wonderful bodies; but
we are unfortunately deficient in observations by which we may be assured* that the occulation
was perfectly central; for, as it has already been observed, the parts of the envelope contiguous
to the nucleus are alternately composed of layers of dense or very attenuated vapor.

[footnote]  *Olbers, in 'Astr. Nachr.', 1828, s. 157, 184.  Arago, 'De la Constitution physique
des Cometes; Annuaire de' 1832, p. 203, 208.  The ancients were struck by the phenomenon that
it was possible to see through comets as through a flame.  The earliest evidence to be met
with of stars having been seen through comets is that of Democritus (Aristot., 'Meteor.', i.,
6, 11), and the statement leads Aristotle to make the not unimportant remark, that he himself
had observed the occulation of one of the stars of Gemini by Jupiter.  Seneca only speaks decidedly
of the transparence of the tail of comets.  "We may see," says he, "stars through a comet as
through a cloud ('Nat. Quaest.', vii., 18); but we can ony see through the rays of the tail,
and not through the body of the comet itself:  'non in ea parte qua sidus ipsum est spissi
et solidi ignis, sed qua rarus splendor occurrit et in crines dispergitur.  Per intervalla
ignium, non er ipsos, vides" (vii., 26).  The last remark is unnecessary, since, as Galileo
observed in the 'Saggiatore (Lettera a Monsignor Cesarini', 1619), we can certainly see through
a flame when it is not of too great a thickness'.

On the other hand the carefully conducted measurements of Bessel prove, beyond all doubt, that
on the 29th of September, 1835, the light of a star of the tenth magnitude, which was then
at a distance of 7".78 from the central point of the head of Halley's comet, passed through
very dense nebulous matter, without experiencing any deflection during its passage.*

[footnote]  *Bessel, in the 'Astron. Nachr.', 1836, No. 301, s. 204, 206.
Struve, in 'Recueil des Mem. de l'Acad. de St. Peterab.', 1836, p. 140, 143,
and 'Astr. Nachr.', 1836, No. 303, s. 238, writes as follows:  "At Dorpat
the star was in conjunction only 2".2 from the brightest point of the comet.
 The star remained continually visible, and its light was not perceptibly
diminished, while the nucleus of the comet seemed to be almost extinguished
before the radiance of the small star of the ninth or tenth magnitude."

If such an absence of refracting power must be ascribed to the nucleus of a comet, we can scarcely
regard the matter composing comets as a gaseous fluid.  The question here arises whether this
absence of refracting power may not be owing to the extreme tenuity of the fluid; or does the
comet consist of separated particles, constituting a cosmical stratum of clouds, which, like
the clouds of our atmosphere, that exercise no influence on the p 105 zenith distance of the
stars, does not affect the ray of light passing through it?  In the passage of a comet over
a star, a more or less considerable diminution of light has often been observed; but this has
been justly ascribed to the brightness of the ground from which the star seems to stand forth
during the passage of the comet.

The most important and decisive observations that we possess on the nature and the light of
comets are due to Arago's polarization experiments.  His polariscope instructs us regarding
the physical constitution of the Sun and comets, indicating whether a ray that reaches us from
a distance of many millions of miles transmits light directly or by reflection; and if the
former, whther the source of light is a solid, a liquid, or a gaseous body. His apparatus was
used at the Paris Observatory in examining the light of Capella and that of the great comet
of 1819.  The latter showed polarized, and therefore reflected light, while the fixed star,
as was to be expected, appeared to be a self-luminous sun.*

[footnote]  *On the 3d of July, 1819, Arago made the first attempt to analyze the light of
comets by polarization, on the evening of the sudden appearance of the great comet.  I was
present at the Paris Observatory, and was fully convinced, as were also Matthieu and the late
Bouvard of the dissimilarity in the intensity of the light seen in the polariscope, when the
instrument received cometary light.  When it received light from Capella, which was near the
comet, and at an equal altitude, the images were of equal intensity.  On the reappearance of
Halley's comet in 1835, the instrument was altered so as to give, according to Arago's chromatic
polarization, two images of complementary colors (green and red).  ('Annales de Chimie', t.
xiii., p. 108; 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 216.)  "We must conclude from these observations," says
Arago, "that the cometary light was not entirely composed of rays having the properties of
direct light, there being light which was reflected specularly or polarized, that is, coming
from the sun.  It can not be stated with absolute certainty that comets shine only with borrowed
light, for bodies, in becoming self-luminous, do not, on that account, lose the power of reflecting
foreign light."

The existance of polarized cometary light announced itself not only by the inequality of the
images, but was proved with greater certainty on the reappearance of Halley's comet, in the
year 1835, by the more striking contrast of the complementary colors, deduced from the laws
of chromatic polarization discovered by Arago in 1811.  These beautiful experiments still leave
it undecided whether, in addition to this reflected solar light, comets may not have light
of their own.  Even in the case of the planets, as, for instance, in Venus, an evolution of
independent light seems very probable.

The variable intensity of light in comets can not always be p 106 explained by the position
of their orbits and their distance from the Sun. It would seem to indicate, in some individuals,
the existence of an inherent process of condensation, and an increased or diminished capacity
of reflecting borrowed light.  In the comet of 1618, and in that which has a period of three
years, it was observed first by Hevelius that the nucleus of the comet diminished at its perihelion
and enlarged at its aphelion, a fact which, after remaining long unheeded, was again noticed
by the talented astronomer Valz at Nismes.  The regularity of the change of volume, according
to the different degrees of distance from the Sun, appears very striking.  The physical explanation
of the phenomenon can not, however, be sought in the condensed layers of cosmical vapor occurring
in the vicinity of the Sun, since it is difficult to imagine the nebulous envelope of the nucleus
of the comet to be vesicular and impervious to the other.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 217-220.  Sir John Herschel, 'Astron.', 488.

The dissimilar eccentricity of the orbits of comets has, in recent times (1819), in the most
brilliant manner enriched our knowledge of the solar system.  Encke has discovered the existence
of a comet of so short a period of revolution that it remains entirely within the limits of
our planetary system, attaining its aphelion between the orbits of the smaller planets and
that of Jupiter.  Its eccentricity must be assumed at 0.845, that of Juno (which has the greatest
eccentricity of any of the planets) being 0.255. Encke's comet has several times, although
with difficulty, been observed by the naked eye, as in Europe in 1819, and according to Rumker,
in New Holland in 1822.  Its period of revolution is about 3 1/3d years; but, from a careful
comparison of the epochs of its return to its perihelion, the remarkable fact has been discovered
that these periods have diminished in the most regular manner between the years 1786 and 1838,
the diminution amounting, in the course of 52 years, to about 1 3/10th days.  The attempt to
bring into unison the results of observation and calculation in the investigation of all the
planetary disturbances, with the view of explaining this phenomenon, has led to the adoption
of the very probable hypothesis that there exists dispersed in space a vaporous substance capable
of acting as a resisting medium.  This matter diminished the tangential force, and with it
the major axis of the comet's orbit.  The value of the constant of the resistance appears to
be somewhat different before and after the perihelion; and this may, perhaps, be ascribed p
107 to the altered form of the small nebulous star in the vicinity of the Sun, and to the action
of the unequal density of the strata of cosmical ether.*

[footnote]  *Encke, in the 'Astronomiche Nachrichten', 1843, No. 489, s. 130-132.

These facts, and the investigations to which they have led, belong to the most interesting
results of modern astronomy.  Encke's comet has been the means of leading astronomers to a
more exact investigation of Jupiter's mass (a most important point with reference to the calculation
of perturbations); and, more recently, the course of this comet has obtained for us the first
determination, although only an approximative one, of a smaller mass for Mercury.

The discovery of Encke's comet, which had a period of only 3 1/3d years, was speedily followed,
in 1826, by that of another, Biela's comet, whose period of revolution is 6 3/4th years, and
which is likewise planetary, having its aphelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter, but within that
of Saturn.  It has a fainter light than Encke's comet, and, like the latter, its motion is
direct, while Halley's comet moves in a course opposite to that pursued by the planets.  Biela's
comet presents the first certain example of the orbit of a comet intersecting that of the Earth.
This position, with reference to our planet, may therefore be productive of danger, if we can
associate an idea of danger with so extraordinary a natural phenomenon, whose history presents
no parallel, and the results of which we are consequently unable correctly to estimate.  Small
masses endowed with enormous velocity may certainly exercise a considerable power; but Laplace
has shown that the mass of the comet of 1770 is probably not equal to 1/5000th that of the
Earth, or about 1/2000th that of the Moon.*

[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 216, 237.

We must not confound the passage of Biela's comet through the Earth's orbit with its proximity
to, or collision with our globe.  When this passage took place, on the 29th of October, 1832,
it required a full month before the Earth would reach the point of intersection of the two
orbits.  These two comets of short periods of revolution also intersect each other, and it
has been justly observed,* that amid the many perturbations experienced by such small bodies
from the largr planets, there is a 'possibility' -- supposing a meeting of these comets to
occur in October -- that the inhabitants of the Earth may witness the extraordinary spectacle
of an encounter between two cosmical bodies, and possibly of their reciprocal penetration and
amalgamation, or of their destruction by means of exhausting emanations.

[footnote]  *Littrow, 'Beschreibende Astron.', 1835, s. 274.  On the inner comet recently discovered
by M. Faye, at the Observatory of Paris, and whose eccentricity is 0.551, its distance at its
perihelion 1.690, and its distance at its aphelion 5.832, see Schumacher, 'Astron. Nachr.',
1844, No. 495.  Regarding the supposed identity of the comet of 1766 with the third comet of
1819, see 'Astr. Nachr.', 1833, No. 239; and on the identity of the comet of 1743 and the fourth
comet of 1819, see No. 237 or the last mentioned work.

Events of this nature, resulting either from deflection occasioned by disturbing masses or
primevally intersecting orbits, must have been of frequent occurrence in the course of millions
of years in the immeasurable regions of ethereal space; but they must be regarded as isolated
occurrences, exercising no more general or alternative effects on cosmical relations than the
breaking forth or extinction of a volcano within the limited sphere of our Earth.

A third interior comet, having likewise a short period of revolution was discovered by Faye
on the 22d of November, 1843, at the Observatory at Paris.  Its elliptic path, which approaches
much more nearly to a circle than that of any other known comet, is included within the orbits
of Mars and Saturn.  This comet, therefore, which, according to Goldschmidt, passes beyond
the orbit of Jupiter, is one of the few whose perihelia are beyond Mars.  Its period of revolution
is 7 29/100 years, and it is not improbable that the form of its present orbit may be owing
to its great approximation to Jupiter at the close of the year 1839.

If we consider the comets in their inclosed elliptic orbits as members of our solar system,
and with respect to the length of their major axes, the amount of their eccentricity, and their
periods of revolution, we shall probably find that the three planetary comets of Encke, Biela,
and Faye are most nearly approached in these respects, first, by the comet discovered in 1766
by Messier, and which is regarded by Clausen as identical with the third comet of 1819; and
next, by the fourth comet of the last-mentioned year, discovered by Blaupain, but considered
by Clausen as identical with that of the year 1743, and whose orbit appears, like that of Lexell's
comet, to have suffered great variations from the proximity and attraction of Jupiter.  The
two last-named comets would likewise seem to have a period of revolution not exceeding five
or six years, and their aphelia are in the vicinity of Jupiter's orbit.  Among the comets that
have a period of revolution of from seventy to p 109 seventy-six years, the first in point
of importance with respect to theoretical and physical astronomy is Halley's comet, whose last
appearance, in 1835, was much less brilliant than was to be expected from preceding ones; next
we would notice Olbers's comet, discovered on the 6th of March, 1815; and, lastly, the comet
discovered by Pons in the year 1812, and whose elliptic orbit has been determined by Encke.
The two latter comets were invisible to the naked eye.  We now know with certainty of nine
returns of Halley's large comet, it having recently been proved by Laugier's calculations*,
that in the Chinese table of comets, first made known to us by Edward Biot, the comet of 1378
is identical with Halley's; its periods of revolution have varied in the interval between 1378
and 1835 from 74.91 to 77.58 years, the mean being 76.1.

[footnote]  *Laugier, in the 'Comptes Rendus des Seances de l'Academie', 1843, t. xvi., p. 1006.

A host of other comets may be contrasted with the cosmical bodies of which
we have spoken, requiring several thousand years to perform their orbits,
which it is difficult to determine with any degree of certainty.  The
beautiful comet of 1811 requires, according to Argelander, a period of 3065
years for its revolution, and the colossal one of 1680 as much as 8800
years, according to Encke's calculation.  These bodies respectively recede,
therefore, 21 and 44 times further than Uranus from the Sun, that is to say,
33,600 and 70,400 millions of miles.  At this enormous distance the
attractive force of the Sun is still manifested; but while the velocity of
the comet of 1680 at its perihelion is 212 miles in a second, that is,
thirteen times greater than that of the Earth, it scarcely moves ten feet in
the second when at its aphelion.  This velocity is only three times greater
than that of water in our most sluggish European rivers, and equal only to
half that which I have observed in the Cassiquiare, a branch of the Orinoco.
 It is highly probable that, among the innumerable host of uncalculated or
undiscovered comets, there are many whose major axes greatly exceed that of
the comet of 1680.  In order to form some idea by numbers, I do not say of
the sphere of attraction, but of the distance in space of a fixed star, or
other sun, from the aphelion of the comet of 1680 (the furthest receding
cosmical body with which we are acquainted in our solar system), it must be
remembered that, according to the most recent determinations of parallaxes,
the nearest fixed star is full 250 times further removed from our sun than
the comet in its aphelion.  The comet's distance is only 44
p 110
times that of Uranus, while 'a' Centauri is 11,000 and 61 Cygni 31,000 times
that of Uranus, according to Bessel's determinations.

Having considered the greatest distances of comets from the central body, it now remains for
us to notice instances of the greatest proximity hitherto measured.  Lexell and Burckhardt's
comet of 1770, so celebrated on account of the disturbances it experienced from Jupiter, has
approached the Earth within a smaller distance than any other comet.  On the 28th of June,
1770, its distance from the Earth was ony six times than of the Moon.  The same comet passed
twice, viz., in 1769 and 1779, through the system of Jupiter's four satellites without producing
the slightest notable change in the well-known orbits of these bodies.  The great comet of
1680 approached at its perihelion eight or nine times nearer to the surface of the Sun than
Lexell's comet did to that of our Earth, being on the 17th of December a sixth part of the
Sun's diameter, or seven tenths of the distance of the Moon from that luminary.  Perihelia
occurring beyond the orbit of Mars can seldom be observed by the inhabitants of the Earth,
owing to the faintness of the light of distant comets; and among those already calculated the
comet of 1729 is the only one which has its perihelion between the orbits of Pallas and Jupiter;
it was even observed beyond the latter.

Since scientific knowledge, although frequently blended with vague and superficial views, has
been more extensively diffused through wider circles of social life, apprehensions of the possible
evils threatened by comets have acquired more weight as their direction has become more definite.
The certainty that there are within the known planetary orbits comets which revisit our regions
of space at short intervals -- that great disturbances have been produced by Jupiter and Saturn
in their orbits, by which such as were apparently harmless have been converted into dangerous
bodies -- the intersection of the Earth's orbit by Biela's comet -- the cosmical vapor, which,
acting as a resisting and impeding medium, tends to contract all orbits -- the individual difference
of comets, which would seem to indicate considerable decreasing gradations in the quantity
of the mass of the nucleus, are all considerations more than equivalent, both as to number
and variety, to the vague fears entertained in early ages of the general conflagration of the
world by 'flaming swords', and stars with 'fiery streaming hair'.  As the consolatory considerations
which may be derived from the calculus of probabilities address themselves to reason and to
p 111 meditative understanding only, and not to the imagination or to a desponding condition
of mind, modern science has been accused, and not entirely without reason, of not attempting
to allay apprehensions which it has been the very means of exciting.  It is an inherent attribute
of the human mind to experience fear, and not hope or joy, at the aspect of that which is unexpected
and extraordinary.*

[footnote]  *Fries, 'Vorlesungen uber die Sternkunde', 1833, s. 262-267 (Lectures on the Science
of Astronomy).  An infelicitously chosen instance of the good omen of a comet may be found
in Seneca, 'Nat. Quest.', vii., 17 and 21.  The philosopher thus writes of the comet:  "Quem
nos Neronis principatu latissimo vidimus et qui cometis detraxit infamiam."

The strange form of a large comet, its faint nebulous light, and its sudden appearance in the
vault of heaven, have in all regions been almost invariably regarded by the people at large
as some new and formidable agent inimical to the existing state of things.  The sudden occurrence
and short duration of the phenomenon lead to the belief of some equally rapid reflection of
its agency in terrestrial matters, whose varied nature renders it easy to find events that
may be regarded as the fulfillment of the evil foretold by the appearance of these mysterious
cosmical bodies.  In our own day, however, the public mind has taken another and more cheerful,
although singular, turn with regard to comets; and in the German vineyards in the beautiful
valleys of the Rhine and Moselle, a belief has arisen, ascribing to these once ill-omened bodies
a beneficial influence on the ripening of the vine.  The evidence yielded by experience, of
which there is no lack in these days, when comets may so frequently be observed, has not been
able to shake the common belief in the meteorological myth of the existence of wandering stars
capable of radiating heat.

[footnote]  * (Much valuable information may be obtained regarding the origin and composition
of arolites or meteoric stones in Memoirs on the subject, by Baumbeer and other writers, in
the numbers of Poggendorf's 'Annalen', from 1845 to the present time.) -- Tr.

If I should seem to dwell on the specific enumeration of these bodies, and of comets, longer
than the general nature of this work might warrant, I have not done so undesignedly.  The diversity
existing in the individual characteristics of comets has already been noticed.  The imperfect
knowledge we possess of their physical character renders it p 112 diifficult in a work like
the present, to give the proper degree of circumstantiality to the phenomena, which, although
of frequent recurrence, have been observed with such various degrees of accuracy, or to separate
the necessary from the accidental.  It is only with respect to measurements and computations
that the astronomy of comets has made any marked advancement, and, consequently, a scientific
consideration of these bodies must be limited to a specification of the differences of physiognomy
and conformation in the nucleus and tail, the instances of great approximation to other cosmical
bodies, and of the extremes in the length of their orbits and in their periods of revolution.
A faithful delineation of these phenomena, as well as of those which we proceed to consider,
can only be given by sketching individual features with the animated circumstantiality of reality.

Shooting stars, fire-balls, and meteoric stones are, with great probability, regarded as small
bodies moving with planetary velocity, and revolving in obedience to the laws of general gravity
in conic sections round the Sun. When these masses meet the Earth in their course, and are
attracted by it, they enter within the limits of our atmosphere in a luminous condition, and
frequently let fall more or less strongly heated stony fragments, covered with a shining black
crust.  When we enter into a careful investigation of the facts observed at those epochs when
showers of shooting stars fell periodically in Cumana in 1799, and in North America during
the years 1833 and 1834, we shall find that 'fire-balls' can not be considered separately from
shooting stars.  Both these phenomena are frequently not only simultaneous and blended together,
but they likewise are often found to merge into one another, the one phenomenon gradually assuming
the character of the other alike with respect to the size of their disks, the emanation of
sparks, and the velocities of their motion.  Although exploding smoking luminous fire-balls
are sometimes seen, even in the brightness of tropical daylight,* equaling in size the apparent
p 113 diameter of the Moon, innumerable quantities of shooting stars have, on the other hand,
been observed to fall in forms of such extremely small dimensions that they appear only as
moving points or 'phosphorescent lines.'**

[footnote]  *A friend of mine, much accustomed to exact trigonometrical measurements, was in
the year 1788 at Popayan, a city which is 2 degrees 26' north latitude, lying at an elevation
of 5583 feet above the level of the sea, and at noon, when the sun was shining brightly in
a cloudless sky, saw his room lighted up by a fire-ball.  He had his back to the window at
the time, and on turning round, perceived that great part of the path traversed by the fire-ball
was still illuminated by the brightest radiance.  Different nations have had the most various
terms to express these phenomena:  The Germans use the word 'Sternschnuppe', literally 'star
snuff' -- an expression well suited to the physical views of the vulgar in former times, according
to which, the lights in the firmament were said to undergo a process of 'snuffing' or cleaning;
and other nations generally adopt a term expressive of a 'shot' or 'fall' of stars, as the
Swedish 'stjernifall', the Italian 'stella cadente', and the English 'star shoot.'  In the
woody district of the Orinoco, on the dreary banks of the Cassiquiare, I heard the natives
in the Mission of Vasiva use terms still more inelegant than the German 'star snuff.'  ('Relation
Historique du Voy. aux Rgions Equinox.', t. ii., p. 513.)  These same tribes term the pearly
drops of dew which cover the beautiful leaves of the heliconia 'star spit.'  In the Lithuanian
mythology, the imagination of the people has embodied its ideas of the nature and signification
of falling stars under nobler and more graceful symbols.  The Parc¾, 'Werpeja', weave in heaven
for the new-born child its thread of fate, attaching each separate thread to a star.  When
death approaches the person, the thread is rent, and the star wanes and sinks to the earth.
Jacob Grimm, 'Deutsche Mythologie', 1843, s. 685.

[footnote]  ** According to the testimony of Professor Denison Olmsted, of Yale College, New
Haven, Connecticut.  (See Poggend., 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxx., s. 194.)  Kepler, who excluded
fire-balls and shooting stars from the domain of astronomy, because they were, according to
his views, "meteors arising from the exhalations of the earth, and blending with the higher
ether," expresses himself, however, generally with much caution.  He says: "Stell¾ cadentes
sunt materia viscida inflammata.  Earum aliqu¾ inter cadendum absumuntur, aliqu¾ ver in terram
cadunt, pondere suo tract¾. Nec est dissimile vero, quasdam conglobatas esse ex materia f¾culent,
in ipsam auram ¾theream immixta:  exque atheris regione, tractu rectilineo, per arem trajicere,
ceu minutos competas, occult causa motus utrorumque." -- Kepler, 'Epit. Astron. Copernican¾',
t. i., p. 80.

It still remains undertermined whether the many luminous bodies that shoot across the sky may
not vary in their nature.  On my return from the equinoctial zones, I was impressed with an
idea that in the torrid regions of the tropics I had more frequently than in our colder latitudes
seen shooting stars fall as if from a height of twelve or fifteen thousand feet; that they
were of brighter colors, and left a more brilliant line of light in their track; but this impression
was no doubt owing to the greater transparency of the tropical atmosphere*, which enables the
eye to penetrate further into distance.

[footnote]  *'Relation Historique', t. i., p. 80, 213, 527.  If in falling stars, as in comets,
we distinguish between the head or nucleus and the tail, we shall find that the greater transparency
of the atmosphere in tropical climates is evinced in the greater length and brilliancy of the
tail which may be observed in those latitudes.  The phenomenon is therefore not necessarily
more frequent there, because it is oftener seen and continues longer visible.  The influence
exercised on shooting stars by the character of the atmosphere is shown occasionally even in
our temperate zone, and at very small distances apart.  Wartmann relates that on the occasion
of a November phenomenon at two places lying very near each other, Geneva and Aux Planchettes,
the number of the meteors counted were as 1 to 7.  (Wartmann, 'Mm. sur les Etoiles filantes',
p. 17.)  The tail of a shooting star (or its 'train'), on the subject of which Brandes has
made so many exact and delicate observations, is in no way to be ascribed to the continuance
of the impression produced by light on the retina.  It sometimes continues visible a whole
minute, and in some rare instances longer than the light of the nucleus of the shooting star;
in which case the luminous track remains motionless.  (Gilb., 'Ann.', bd. xiv., s. 251.)  This
circumstance further indicates the analogy between large shooting stars and fire-balls. Admiral
Krusenstern saw, in his voyage round the world, the train of a fire-ball shine for an hour
after the lluminous body itself had disappeared, and scarcely move throughout the whole time.
('Reise', th. i., s. 58.)  Sir Alexander Burnes gives a charming description of the transparency
of the clear atmosphere of Bokhara, which was once so favorable to the pursuit of astronomical
observations.  Bokhara is situated in 39 degrees 48' north latitude, and at an elevation of
1280 feet above the level of the sea. "There is a constant serenity in its atmosphere, and
an admirable clearness in the sky.  At night, the stars have uncommon luster, and the Milky
Way shines gloriously in the firmament.  There is also a never-ceasing display of the most
brilliant meteors, which dart like rockets in the sky; ten or twelve of them are sometimes
seen in an hour, assuming every color -- fiery red, blue, pale, and faint.  It is a noble country
for astronomical science, and great must have been the advantage enjoyed by the famed observatory
of Samarkand."  (Burnes, 'Travels into Bokhara', vol. ii. (1834), p. 158.)  A mere traveler
must not be reproached for calling ten or twelve shooting stars in an hour "many," since it
is only recently that we have learned, from careful observations on this subject in Europe,
that eight is the mean number which may be seen in an hour in the field of vision of one individual
(Quetelet, 'Corresp. Mathm.', Novem., 1837, p. 447); this number is, however, limited to five
or six by that diligent observer, Olbers.  (Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1838, s. 325.)

p 114 Sir Alexander Burnes likewise extols as a consequence of the purity of the atmosphere
in Bokhara the enchanting and constantly-recurring spectacle of variously-colored shooting stars.

The connection of meteoric stones with the grander phenomenon of fire-balls -- the former being
known to be projected from the latter with such force as to penetrate from ten to fifteen feet
into the earth -- has been proved, among many other instances, in the falls of azzzuerolites
at Barbotan, in the Department des Landes (24th July, 1790), at Siena (16th June, 1794), at
Weston, in Connecticut, U. S. (14th December, 1807), and at Juvenas in the Department of Ardche
(14th June, 1821).  Meteoric stones are in some instances thrown from dark clouds suddenly
formed in a clear sky, and fall with a noise resembling thunder.  Whole districts have thus
occasionally been covered with thousands of fragmentary masses, of uniform character but unequal
magnitudes, that p 115 have been hurled from one of these moving clouds.  In less frequent
cases, as in that which occurred on the 16th of September, 1843, at Kleinwenden, near Mhilhausen,
a large arolite fell with a thundering crash while the sky was clear and cloudless.  The intimate
affinity between fire-balls and shooting stars is further proved by the fact that fire-balls,
from which meteoric stones have been thrown have occasionally been found, as at Angers, on
the 9th of June, 1822, having a diameter scarcely equal to that of the small fire-works called
Roman candles.

The formative power, and the nature of the physical and chemical processes involved in these
phenomena are questions all equally shrouded in mystery, and we are as yet ignorant whether
the particles composing the dense mass of meteoric stones are originally, as in comets, separated
from one another when they become luminous to our sight, or whether in the case of smaller
shooting stars, any compace substance actually falls, or, finally, whether a meteor is composed
only of a smoke-like dust, containing iron and nickel; while we are wholly ignorant of what
takes place within the dark cloud from which a noise like thunder is often heard for many minutes
before the stones fall.*

[footnote]  *On 'mteoric dust', see Arago, in the 'Annuaire' for 1832, p. 254.  I haave very
recently endeavored to show, in another work ('Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 408). how the Scythian
saga of the sacred gold, which fell burning from heaven, and remained in the possession of
the Golden Horde of the Paralat¾ (Herod., iv., 5-7), probably originated in the vague recollection
of the fall of an arolite.  The ancients had also some strange fictions (Dio Cassius, lxxv.,
1259) or silver which had fallen from heaven, and with which it had been attempted, under the
Emperor Severus, to cover bronze coins; metallic iron was however, known to exist in meteoric
stones.  (Plin., ii., 56.)  The frequently-recurring expression 'lapidibus pluit' must not
always be understood to refer to falls of arolites.  In Liv., xxv., 7, it probably refers
to pumice ('rapilli') ejected from the volcano, Mount Albanus (Monte Cavo), which was not wholly
extinguished at the time.  (See Heyne, 'Opuscula Acad.', t. iii., p. 261; and my 'Relation
Hist.', t. i., p. 394.)  The contest of Hercules with the Ligyans, on the road from the Caucasus
to the Hesperides, belongs to a different sphere of ideas, being an attempt to explain mythically
the origin of the round quartz blocks in the Ligyan field of stones at the mouth of the Rhone,
which Aristotle supposes to have been ejected from a fissure during an earthquake, and Posidonius
to have been caused by the force of the waves of an inland piece of water.  In the fragments
that we still possess of the play of ®schylus, the 'Prometheus Delivered', every thing proceeds,
however, in part of the narration, as in a fall of arolites, for Jupiter draws together a
cloud, and causes the "district around to be covered by a shower of round stones".  Posidonius
even ventured to deride the geognostic myth of the blocks and stones.  The Lygian field of
stones was, however, very naturally and well described by the ancients.  The district is now
known as 'La Crau.'  (See Guerin, 'Mesures Baromtriques dans les Alpes, et Mtorologie d'Avignon',
1829, chap. xii., p. 115.)

p 116 We can ascertain by measurement the enormous, wonderful, and wholly planetary velocity
of shooting stars, fire-valls and meteoric stones, and we can gain a knowledge of what is the
general and uniform character of the phenomenon, but not of the genetically cosmical process
and the results of the metamorphoses.  If meteoric stones while revolving in space are already
consolidated into dense masses,* less dense, however, p 117 than the mean density of the earth,
they must be very small nuclei, which surrounded by inflammable vapor or gas, form the innermost
part of fire-balls, from the height and apparent diameter of which we may, in the case of the
largest, estimate that the actual diameter varies from 500 to about 2800 feet.

[footnote] *The specific weight of arolites varies from 1.9 (Alais) to 4.3 (Tabor).  Their
general density may be set down as 3, water being 1.  As to what has been said in the text
of the actual diameters of fire-balls, we must remark, that the numbers have been taken from
the few measurements that can be relied upon as correct.  These give for the fire-ball of Weston,
Connecticut (14th December, 1807), only 500; for that observed by Le Roi (10th July, 1771)
about 1000 and for that estimated by Sir Charles Blagden (18th January, 1783) 2600 feet in
diameter.  Brandes ('Unterhaltungen' bd.i., s. 42) ascribes a diameter varying from 80 to 120
feet to shooting stars, and a luminous train extending from 12 to 16 miles.  There are, however,
ample optical causes for supposing that the apparent diameter of fire-balls and shooting stars
has been very much overrated.  The volume of the largest fire-ball yet observed can not be
compared with that of Ceres, estimating generally so exact and admirable treatise, 'On the
Connection of the Physical Sciences', 1835, p. 411.)  With the view of elucidating what has
been stated in the text regarding the large zrolite that fell into the bed of the River Narni,
but has not again been found, I will give the passage made known by Pertz, from the 'Chronicon
Benedicti, Monachi Sancti Andre¾ in Mont Soracte', a MS. belonging to the tenth century, and
preserved in the Chigi Library at Rome.  The Barbarous Latin of that age has been left unchanged.
"Anno 921, temporibus domini Johannis Decimi pape, in anno pontificatus illius 7 visa sunt
signa.  Nam juxta urben Romam lapides plurimi de c¾lo cadere visi sunt.  In civilate qu¾ vocatur
Narnia tam diri ac tetri, ut nihil aliud credatur, quam de infernalibus locis deducti essent.
Nam ita ex illis lapidibus unus omnium maximum est, ut decidens in flumen Narnus, ad mensuram
unius cubiti super aquas fluminus usque hodie videretur.  Nam et ignit¾ita ut pene terra contingeret.
Ali cadentes," etc.  (Pertz, 'Monum. Germ. Hist. Scriptores', t. iii., p. 715.)  On the arolites
of gos Potamus, which fell, according to the Parian Chroniccle, in the 78 1 Olympiad, see Bckh,
'Corp. Inscr. Graec', t. ii., p. 302, 320, 340; also Aristot., 'Meteor.', i., 7 (Ideler's 'Comm.',
t. i., p. 404-407); Stob., 'Eel. Phys.', i., 25, p. 508 (Heeren); Plut., 'Lys.', c. 12; Diog.
Laert., ii., 10; and see, also, subsequent notes in this work.  According to a Mongolisn tradition,
a black fragment of a rock, forty feet in height, fell from heaven on a plain near the source
of the Great Yellow River in Western China.  (Abel Rmusat, in Lamtherie, 'Jour. de Phys.',
1819, Mai p. 264.)

The largest meteoric masses as yet known are those of Otumpa, in Chaco, and of Bahia, in Brazil,
described by Rubi de Celis as being from 7 to 7 1/2 feet in length.  The meteoric stone of
gos Potamos, celebrated in antiquity, and even mentioned in the Chronicle of the Parian Marbles,
which fell about the year in which Socrates was born, has been described as of the size of
two mill-stones, and equal in weight to a full wagon load.  Notwithstanding the failure that
has attended the efforts of the African traveler, Brown, I do not wholly relinquish the hope
that, even after the lapse of 2312 years, this Thracian meteoric mass, which it would be so
difficult to destroy, may be found, since the region in which it fell is now bcome so easy
of access to European travelers.  The huge arolite which in the beginning of the tenth century
fell into the river at Narni, projected between three and four feet above the surface of the
water, as we learn from a document lately discovered by Pertz.  It must be remarked that these
meteoric bodies, whether in ancient or modern times can only be regarded as the principal fragments
of masses that have been broken up by the explosion either of a fire-ball of a dark cloud.

On considering the enormous velocity with which, as has been mathematically proved, meteoric
stones reach the earth from the extremest confines of the atmosphere, and the lengthened course
traversed by fire-balls through the denser strata of the air, it seems more than improbable
that these metalliferous stony masses, containing perfectly-formed crystals of olivine, labradorite,
and pyroxene, should in so short a period of time has been converted from a vaporous condition
to a solid nucleus.  Moreover, that which falls from meteoric masses, even where the internal
composition is chemically different, exhibits almost always the peculiar character of a fragment,
being of a prismatic or truncated pyramidal form, with broad, somewhat curved faces, and rounded
angles.  But whence comes this form, which was first recognized by Schreiber as characteristic
of the 'severed' part of a rotating planetary body?  Here, as in the sphere of organic life,
all that appertains to the history of development remains hidden in obscurity.  Meteoric masses
become luminous and kindle at heights which p 118 must be regarded as almost devoid of air,
of occupied by an atmosphere that does not even contain 1/100000th part of oxygen.  The recent
investigations of Biot on the important phenomenon of twilight* have considerably lowered the
lines which had, perhaps with some degree of temerity, been usually termed the boundaries of
the atmosphere; but processes of light may be evolved independently of the presence of oxygen,
and Poisson conjectured that aroliteswere ignited far beyond the range of our atmosphere.
Numerical calculation and geometrical measurement are the only means by which as in the case
of the larger bodies of our solar system, we are enabled to impart a firm and safe basis to
our investigations of meteoric stones.

[footnote]  *Biot, 'Trait d'Astronomie Physique' (3me d.), 1841, t. i., p. 149, 177, 238,
312.  My lamented friend Poisson endeavored, in a singular manner, to solve the difficulty
attending an assumption of the spontaneous ignition of meteoric stones at an elevation where
the density of the atmosphere is almost null.  These are his words:  "It is difficult to attribute,
as is uaually done, the incandescence of arolites to friction against the molecules of the
atmosphere at an elevation above the earth where the density of the air is almost null.  May
we not suppose that the electric fluid, in a neutral condition, forms a kind of atmosphere,
extending far beyond the mass of our atmosphere, yet subject to terrestrial attraction, although
physically imponderable, and consequently following our globe in its motion?  According to
this hypothesis, the bodies of which we have been speaking would, on entering this imponderable
atmosphere, decompose the neutral fluid by their unequal action on the two electricities, and
they would thus be heated, and in a state of incandescence, by becoming electrified."  (Poisson,
'Rech. sur la Probabilit des Jugements', 1837, p. 6.)

Although Halley pronounced the great fire-ball of 1686, whose motion was opposite to that of
the earth in its orbit,* to be a cosmical body, Chadni, in 1794, first recognized, with ready
acuteness of mind, the connection between fire-balls and the stones projected from the atmosphere,
and the motions of the former bodies in space.**

[footnote] **The first edition of Chlandni's important treatise, 'Ueber den Ursprung der von
Pallas gefundenen und anderen Eisenmassen' (On the Origin of the masses of Iron found by Pallas,
and other similar masses), appeared two months prior to the shower of stones at Siena, and
two years before Lichtenberg stated, in the 'Gttingen Taschenbuch', that "stones reach our
atmosphere from the remoter regions of space.'  Comp., also, Olbers's letter to Benzenberg,
18th Nov., 1837, in Benzenberg's 'Treatise on Shooting Stars', p. 186.

A brilliant confirmation of the cosmical origin of these phenomena has been afforded by Denison
Olmsted, at New Haven, Connecticut, who has shown on the concurrent authority of all eye-witnesses,
that during the celebrated fall of shooting stars on the night between the 12th p 119 and 13th
of November, 1833, the fire-balls and shooting stars all emerged from one and the same quarter
of the heavens, namely, in the vicinity of the star 'gamma' in the constellation Leo, and did
not deviate from this point, although the star changed its apparent height and azimuth during
the time of the observation.  Such an independence of the Earth's rotation shows that the luminous
body must have reached our atmosphere from 'without.' According to Encke's computation* of
the whole p 120 number of observations made in the United States of North America, between
the thirty-fifth and the forty-second degrees of latitude, it would appear that all these meteors
came from the same point of space in the direction in which the Earth was moving at the time.

[footnote]  *Encke, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiii. (1834), s. 213.
Arago, in the 'Annuaire' for 1836, p. 291.  Two letters which I wrote to
Benzenberg, May 19 and October 22, 1837, on the conjectural precession of
the nodes in the orbit of periodical falls of shooting stars.  (Benzenberg's
'Sternsch.', s. 207 and 209.)  Olbers subsequently adopted this opinion of
the gradual retardation of the November phenomenon.  ('Astron. Nachr.',
1838, No. 372, s. 180.)  If I may venture to combine two of the falls of
shooting stars mentioned by the Arabian writers with the epochs found by
Boguslawski for the fourteenth century, I obtain the following more or less
accordant elements of the movements of the nodes:
     In Oct., 902, on the night in which King Ibrahim ben Ahmed died, there
fell a heavy shower of shooting stars, "like a fiery rain;" and this year
was, therefore, called the year of stars.  (Conde, 'Hist. de la Domin.' de
los Arabes', p. 346.)
     On the 19th of Oct., 1202, the stars were in motion all night.  "They
fell like locusts."  ('Comptes Rendus', 1837, t. i., p. 294; and Fr¾hn, in
the 'Bull. de l'Acadmie de St. Ptersbourg', t. iii., p. 308.)
     On the 21st Oct., O.S., 1366, "'die sequente post festum XI. millia
Virginum ab hora matutina usque ad horam primam vis¾ sunt quasi stell¾ de
c¾lo cadere continuo, et in tanta multitudine, quod nemo narrare suf
ficit.'"  This remarkable notice, of which we shall speak more fully in the
subsequent part of this work, was found by the younger Von Boguslawski, in
Benesse (de Horowic) de Weitmil or Weithml, 'Chronicon Ecclesi¾
Pragensis', p. 389.  This chronicle may also be found in the second part of
'Scriptores rerum Bohemicarum', by Pelzel and Dobrowsky, 1784.  (Schum.,
'Astr. Nachr.', Dec., 1839.)
     On the night between the 9th and 10th of November, 1787, many falling
stars were observed at Manheim, Southern Germany, by Hemmer (Kmtz,
'Meteor.', th. iii., s. 237.)
     After midnight, on the 12th of November, 1799, occurred the
extraordinary fall of stars at Cumana, which Bonpland and myself have
described, and which was observed over a great part of the earth.  ('Relat.
Hist.', t. i., p. 519-527.)
     Between the 12th and 13th of November, 1822, shooting stars,
intermingled with fire-balls, were seen in large numbers by Kloden, at
Potsdam.  (Gilbert's 'Ann.', bd. lxxii., s. 291.)
     On the 13th of November, 1831, at 4 o'clock in the morning, a great
shower of falling stars was seen by Captain Brard, on the Spanish coast,
near Carthagena del Levante.  ('Annuaire', 1836, p. 297.)
     In the night between the 12th and 13th of November, 1833, occurred the
phenomenon so admirably described by Professor Olmsted, in North America.
     In the night of the 13-14th of November, 1834, a similar fall of
shooting stars was seen in North America, although the numbers were not
quite so considerable.  (Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiv., s. 129.)
     On the 13th of November, 1835, a barn was set on fire by the fall of a
sporadic fire-ball, at Belley, in the Department de l'Ain.  ('Annuaire',
1836, p. 296.)
     In the year 1838, the stream showed itself most decidedly on the night
of the 13-14th of November.  ('Astron. Nachr.', 1838, No. 372.)

On the recurrence of falls of shooting stars in North America, in the month of November of
the years 1834 and 1837, and in the analogous falls observed at Bremen in 1838, a like general
parallelism of the orbits, and the same direction of the meteors from the constellation Leo,
were again noticed.  It has been supposed that a greater parallelism was observable in the
direction of periodic falls of shooting stars than in those of sporadic occurrence; and it
has further been remarked, that in the periodically-recurring falls in the month of August,
as, for instance, in the year 1839, the meteors came principally from one point between Perseus
and Taurus, toward the latter of which constellations in the Earth was then moving.  This peculiarity
of the phenomenon, manifested in the retrograde direction of the orbits in November and August,
should be thoroughly investigated by accurate observations, in order that it may either be
fully confirmed or refuted.

The heights of shooting stars, that is to say, the heights of the points at which they begin
and cease to be visible, vary exceedingly, fluctuating between 16 and 140 miles.  This important
result, and the enormous velocity of these problematical asteroids, were first ascertained
by Benzenberg and Brandes, by simultaneous observations and determinations of parallax at the
extremities of a base line of 49,020 feet in length.*

[footnote]  *I am well aware that, among the 62 shooting stars
simultaneously observed in Silesia, in 1823, at the suggestion of Professor
Brandes some appeared to have an elevation of 183 to 240, or even 400 miles.
 (Brandes, 'Unterhaltungen fr Freunde der Astronomie und Physik', heft i.,
s. 48.  Instructive Narratives for the Lovers of Astronomy and Physics.)
But Olbers considered that all determinations for elevations beyond 120
miles must be doubtful, owing to the smallness of the parallax.

The relative velocity of motion is from 18 to 36 miles in a second, and consequently equal
to planetary velocity.  This planetary velocity,* as well as the direction of the orbits p
121 of fire-balls and shooting stars, which has frequently been observed to be opposite to
that of the Earth, may be considered as conclusive arguments against the hypothesis that arolites
derive their origin from the so-called active 'lunar volcanoes.'

[footnote]  *The planetary velocity of translation, the movement in the orbit, is in Mercury
26.4, in Venus 19.2, and in the Earth 16.4 miles in a second.

Numerical views regarding a greater or lesser volcanic force on a small cosmical body, not
surrounded by any atmosphere, must, from their nature, be wholly arbitrary.  We may imagine
the reaction of the interior of a planet on its crust ten or even a hundred times greater than
that of our present terrestrial volcanoes; the direction of masses projected from a satellite
revolving from west to east might appear retrogressive, owing to the Earth in its orbit subsequently
reaching that point of space at which these bodies fall.  If we examine the whole sphere of
relations which I have touched upon in this work, in order to escape the charge of having made
unproved assertions, we shall find that the hypothesis of the selenic origin of meteoric stones*
depends upon a number of conditions p 122 whose accidental coincidence could alone convert
a possible into an actual fact.

[footnote]  *Chladni states that an Italian physicist, Paolo Maria Terzago,
on the occasion of the fall of an arolite at Milan in 1660, by which a
Franciscan monk was killed, was the first who surmised that arolites were
of selenic origin.  He says, in a memoir entitled 'Mus¾um Septalianum,
Manfredi Septal¾, Patricii Mediolanensis, industrioso labore constructum'
(Tortona, 1664, p. 44), "Labant philosophorum mentes sub horum lapidum
ponderibus; ni dicire velimus, lunan terram alteram, sine mundum esse, ex
cujus montibus divisa frustra in inferiorem nostrum hunc orben dela bantur."
 Without any previous knowledge of this conjecture, Olbers was led, in the
year 1795 (after the celebrated fall at Siena on the 16th of June, 1794),
into an investigation of the amount of the initial tangential force that
would be requisite to bring to the Earth masses projected from the Moon.
This ballistic problem occupied, during ten or twelve years, the attention
of the geometricians Laplace, Biot, Brandes, and Poisson.  The opinion which
was then so prevalent, but which has since been abandoned, of the existence
of active volcanoes in the Moon, where air and water are absent, led to a
confusion in the minds of the generality of persons between mathematical
possibilities and physical probabilities.  Olbers, Brandes, and Chladni
thought "that the velocity of 16 to 32 miles, with which fire-balls and
shooting stars entered our atmosphere," furnished a refutation to the view
of their selenic origin.  According to Olbers, it would require to reach the
Earth, setting aside the resistance of the air, an initial velocity of 8292
feet in the second; according to Laplace, 7862; to Biot, 8282; and to
Poisson, 7595.  Laplace states that this velocity is only five or six times
as great as that of a cannon ball; but Olbers has shown "that, with such an
initial velocity as 7500 or 8000 feet in a second, meteoric stones would
arrive at the surface of our earth with a velocity of only 35,000 feet (or
1.53 German geographical mile).  But the measured velocity of meteoric
stones averages five such miles, or upward of 114,000 feet to a second; and,
consequently, the original velocity of projection from the Moon must be
almost 110,000 feet, and therefore fourteen times greater than Laplace
asserted."  (Olbers, in Schum, 'Jahrb.', 1837, p. 52-58; and in Gehler,
'Neues Physik.'  'Wrterbuche', bd. vi., abth.3, s. 2199-2136.)  If we
could assume volcanic forces to be still active on the Moon's surface, the
absence of atmospheric resistance would certainly give to their projectile
force an advantage over that of our terrestrial volcanoes; but even in
respect to the measure of the latter force (the projectile force of our own
volcanoes), we have no observations on which any reliance can be placed, and
it has probably been exceedingly overrated.  Dr. Peters, who accurately
observed and measured the phenomena presented by ®tna, found that the
greatest velocity of any of the stones projected from the crater was only
1250 feet to a second.  Observations on the Peak of Teneriffe, in 1798, gave
3000 feet.  Although Laplace, at the end of his work ('Expos. du Syst. du
Monde', ed. de 1824, p. 399), cautiously observes, regarding arolites,
"that in all probability they come from the depths of space," yet we see
from another passage (chap. vi., p. 233) 6that, being probably unacquainted
with the extraordinary planetary velocity of meteoric stones, he inclines to
the hypothesis of their lunar origin, always, however, assuming that the
stones projjected from the Moon "become satellites of our Earth, describing
around it more or less eccentric orbits, and thus not reaching its
atmosphere until several or even many revolutions have been accomplished."
As an Italian at Tortona had the fancy that arolites came from the Moon,
so some of the Greek philosophers thought they came from the Sun.  This was
the opinion of Diogenes Laertius (ii., 9) regarding the origin of the mass
that fell at "gos Potamos (see note, p. 116).  Pliny, whose labors in
recording the opinions and statements of preceding writers are astonishing,
repeats the theory, and derides it the more freely, because he, with earlier
writers (Diog. Laert., 3 and 5, p. 99, Hbner), accuses Anaxagoras of
having predicted the fall of arolites from the
Sun:  "Celebrant Gr¾ci Anaxagoram Clazomenium Olympiadis septuagesim¾
octav¾ secundo anno pr¾dixisse c¾lestium litterarum scientia quibus
diebus saxum casurum esse e sole, idque factum interdia in Thraci¾ parte ad
gos flumen.  Quod si quis pr¾dictum credat, simul fateatur necesse est,
majoris miraculi divinitatem Anaxagor¾ fuisse, solvique rerum natur¾
intellectum, et confundi omnia, si aut ipse Sol lapis esse aut unquam
lapidem in eo fuisse credatur; decidere tamen crebro non erit dubium."  The
fall of a moderate-sized stone, which is preserved in the Gymnasium at
Abydos, is also reported to have been foretold by Anaxagoras.  The fall of
arolites in bright sunshine, and when the Moon's disk was invisible,
probably led to the idea of sun-stones.  Moreover, according to one of the
physical dogmas of Anaxagoras, which brought on him the persecution of the
theologians (even as they have attacked the geologists of our own times),
the Sun was regarded as "a molten fiery mass" ([Greed words]).  In
accordance with these views of Anaxagoras, we find Euripides, in 'Phaton',
terming the Sun "a golden mass;" that is to say, a fire-colored,
brightly-shining matter, but not leading to the inference that arolites
are golden sun-stones.  (See note to page 115.)  Compare Valckenaer,
'Diatribe in Eurip. perd. Dram. Reliquias', 1767, p. 30.  Diog. Laert., ii.,
40.  Hence, among the Greek philosophers, we find four hypotheses regarding
the origin of falling stars:  a telluric origin from ascending exhalations;
masses of stone raised by hurricane (see Aristot., 'Meteor., lib. i., cap.
iv., 2-13, and cap. vii., 9); a solar origin; and, lastly, an origin in the
regions of space, as heavenly bodies which had long remained invisible.
Respecting this  last opinion, which is that of Diogenes of Apollonia, and
entirely accords with that of the present day, see pages 124 and 125.  It is
worthy of remark, that in Syria, as I have been assured by a learned
Orientalist, now resident at Smyrna, Andrea de Nericat, who instructed me in
Persian, there is a popular belief that arolites chiefly fall on clear
moonlight nights.  The ancients, on the contrary, especially looked for
their fall during lunar eclipses.  (See Pliny, xxxvii., 10, p. 164.
Solinus, c. 37.  Salm., 'Exere.', p. 531; and the passages collected by
Ukert, in his 'Geogr. der Griechen und Rmer', th. ii., 1, s. 131, note
14.)  On the improbability that meteoric masses are formed from
metal-dissolving gases, which, according to Fusinieri, may exist in the
highest strata of our atmosphere, and previously diffused through an almost
boundless space, may suddenly assume a solid condition, and on the
penetration and misceability of gases, see my '
Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 525.

p 122 The view of the original existence of p 123 small planetary masses in space is simpler,
and at the same time, more analogous with those entertained concerning the formation of other
portions of the solar system.

It is very probable that a large number of these cosmical bodies traverse space undestroyed
by the vicinity of our atmosphere, and revolve round the Sun without experiencing any alteration
but a slight increase in the eccentricity of their orbits, occasioned by the attraction of
the Earth's mass.  We may, consequently, suppose the possibility of these bodied remaining
invisible to us during many years and frequent revolutions.  The supposed phenomenon of ascending
shooting stars and fire-balls, which Chladni has unsuccessfully endeavored to explain on the
hypothesis of the 'reflection' of strongly compressed air, appears at first sight as the consequence
of some unknown tngential force propelling bodies from the earth; but Bessel has shown by theoretical
deductions, confirmed by Feldt's carefully-conducted calculations, that, owing to the absence
of any proofs of the simultaneous occurrence of the observed disappearances, the assumptiopn
of an ascent of shooting stars was rendered wholly improbable, and inadmissible as a result
of observation.*

[footnote] *Bessel, in Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.', 1839, No 389 und 381, s. 222 und 346.  At the
conclusion of the Memoir there is a comparison of the Sun's longitudes with the epochs of the
November phenomenon, from the period of the first observations in Cumana in 1799,

The opinion advanced by Olbers that the explosion of shooting stars and ignited fire-balls
not moving in straight lines may impel meteors upward in the manner of rockets, and influence
the direction of their orbits, must be made the subject of future researches.

Shooting stars fall either seprately and in inconsiderable numbers, that is, sporadically,
or in swarms of many thousands. p 124 The latter, which are compared by Arabian authors to
swarms of locusts, are periodic in their occurrence, and move in streams, generally in a parallel
direction.  Among periodic falls, the most celebrated are that known as the November phenomenon,
occurring from about the 12th to the 14th of November, and that of the festival of St. Lawrence
(the 10th of August), whose "fiery tears" were noticed in former times in a church calendar
of England, no less than in old traditionary legends, as a meteorological event of constant
recurrence.*

[footnote]  *Dr. Thomas Forster ('The Pocket Encyclopedia of Natural Phenomena' 1827, p. 17)
states that a manuscript is preserved in the library of Christ's College, Cambridge,** written
in the tenth century by a monk, and entitled 'Ephemerides Rerum Naturalium', in which the natural
phenomena for each day of the year are inscribed as, for instance, the first flowering of plants,
the arrival of birds, etc.; the 10th of August is distinguished by the word "meteorodes." 
It was this indication, and the tradition of the fiery tears of St. Lawrence, that chiefly
induced Dr. Forster to undertake his extremely zealous investigation of the August phenomena.

Notwithstanding the great quantity of shooting stars and fire-balls of the most various dimensions,
which, according to Klden, were seen to fall at Potsdam on the night between the 12th and
13th of November, 1822, and on the same night of the year in 1832 throughout the whole of Europe,
from Portsmouth to Orenburg on the Ural River, and even in the southern hemisphere, as in the
Isle of France, no attention was directed to the 'periodicity' of the phenomenon, and no idea
seems to have been entertained of the connection existing between the fall of shooting stars
and the recurrence of certain days, until the prodigious swarm of shooting stars which occurred
in North America between the 12th and 13th of November, 1833, and was observed by Olmsted and
Palmer.  The stars fell on this occasion, like flakes of snow, and it was calculated that at
least 240,000 had fallen during a period of nine hours.  Palmer, of New Haven, Connecticut,
was led, in consequence of this splendid phenomenon, to the recollection of the fall of meteoric
stones in 1799, first described by Ellicot and myself,* and which, by p 125 a comparison of
the facts I had adduced, showed that the phenomenon had been simultaneously seen in the New
Continent, from the equator to New Herrnhut in Greenland (65 degrees 14' north latitude), and
between 46 degrees and 82 degrees longitude.

[footnote]  *Humb., 'Rel. Hist.', t. i., p. 519-527.  Ellicot in the 'Transactions of the American
Society', 1804, vol. vi., . 29.  Arago makes the following observations in reference to the
November phenomena:  "We thus become more and more confirmed in the belief that there exists
a zone composed of millions of small bodies, whose orbits cut the plane of the ecliptic at
about the point which out Earth annually occupies between the 11th and 13th of November.  It
is a new planetary world beginning to be revealed to us."  ('Annuaire', 1836, p. 296.)

The identity of the epochs was recognized with astonishment.  The stream which had been seen
from Jamaica to Boston (40 degrees 21' north latitude) to traverse the whole vault of heaven
on the 12th and 13th of November, 1833, was again observed in the United States in 1834, on
the night between the 13th and 14th of November, although on this latter occasion it showed
itself with somewhat less intensity.  In Europe the periodicity of the phenomenon has since
been manifested with great regularity.

Another and a like regularly recurring phenomenon is that noticed in the month of August, the
meteoric stream of St. Lawrence, appearing between the 9th and 14th of August.  Muschenbrock,*
as early as in the middle of the last century, drew attention to the frequency of meteors in
the month of August' but their certain periodic return about the time of St. Lawrence's day
was first shown by Quetelet, Olbers, and Benzenberg.

[footnote]  *Compare Muschenbroek, 'Introd. ad Phil. Nat.', 1762, t. ii., p.
1061; Howard, 'On the Climate of London', vol. ii., p. 23, observations of
the year 1806; seven years, therefore aftr the earliest observations of
Brandes (Benzenberg, 'ber Sternschnuppen', s. 240-244); the August
observations of Thomas Forster, in Quetelet, op. cit., p. 438-453; those of
Adolph Erman, Boguslawski, and Kreil, in Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1838, s. 317-330.
 Regarding the point of origin in Perseus, on the 10th of August, 1839, see
the accurate measurements of Bessel and Erman (Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.', No.
385 und 428); but on the 10th of August, 1837, the path does not apper to
have been retrograde; see Arago in 'Comptes Rendus', 1837, t. ii., p. 183.

We shall, no doubt, in time, discover other periodically appearing streams,* probably about
the 22d to the p. 126 25th of April, between the 6th and 12th of December, and, to judge by
the number of true falls of arolites enumerated by Capocci, also between the 27th and 29th
of November, of about the 17th of July.

[footnote]  *On the 25th of April, 1095, "innumerable eyes in France saw stars falling from
heaven as thickly as hail" ('ut grando, nisi lucerent, pro densitate putaretur'; Baldr., p.
88), and this occurrence was regarded by the Council of Clermont as indicative of the great
movement in Christendom.  (Wilken, 'Gesch. der Kreuzzge', bd. i., s. 75.)  On the 25th of
April, 1800, a great fall of stars was observed in Virginia and Massachusetts; it was "a fire
of rockets that lasted two hours."  Arago was the first to call attention to the "traine d'asterodes,"
as a recurring phenomenon.  ('Annuaire', 1836, p. 297.)  The falls of arolites in the beginning
of the month of December are also deserving of notice.  In reference to their periodic recurrence
as a meteoric stream, we may mention the early observation of Brandes on the night of the 6th
and 7th of December, 1798 (when he counted 2000 falling stars), and very probably the enormous
fall of arolites that occurred at the Rio Assu, near the village of Macao, in the Brazils,
on the 11th of December, 1836.  (Brandes, 'Unterhalt. fr Freunde der Physik', 1825, heft i.,
s. 65, and 'Comptes Rendus', t. v., p. 211.)  Capocci, in the interval between 1809 and 1839,
a space of thirty years, has discovered twelve authenticated cases of arolites occurring between
the 27th and 29th of November, besides others on the 13th of November, the 10th of August,
and the 17th of July. ('Comptes Rendus', t. xi., p. 357.)  It is singular that in the portion
of the Earth's path corresponding with the months of January and February, and probably also
with March, no 'periodic' streams of falling stars of arolites have as yet been noticed; although
when in the South Sea in the year 1803, I observed on the 15th of March a remarkably large
number of falling stars, and they were seen to fall as in a swarm in the city of Quito, shortly
before the terrible earthquake of Riobamba on the 4th of February, 1797.  From the phenomena
hitherto observed, the following epochs seem especially worthy of remark: 22d to the 25th of
April. 17th of July (17th to the 26th of July?).  (Quet., 'Corr.', 1837, p. 435.) 10th of August.
12th to the 14th of November. 27th to the 29th of November. 6th to the 12th of December. When
we consider that the regions of space must be occupied by myriads of comets, we are led by
analogy, notwithstanding the differences existing between isolated comets and rings filled
with asteroids, to regard the frequency of these meteoric streams with less astonishment than
the first consideration of the phenomenon would be likely to excite.

Although the phenomena hitherto observed appear to have been independent of the distance from
the pole, the temperature of the air, and other climatic relations, there is, however, one
perhaps accidentally coincident phenomenon which must not be wholly disregarded.  The Northern
Light, the Aurora Borealis, was unusually brilliant on the occurrence of the Borealis, was
unusually brilliant on the occurrence of the splendid fall of meteors of the 12th and 13th
November, 1833, described by Olmsted.  It was also observed at Bremen in 1838, where the periodic
meteoric fall was, however, less remarkable than at Richmond, near London.  I have mentioned
in another work the singular fact observed by Admiral Wrangel, and frequently confirmed to
me by himself,* that when he p 127 was on the Siberian coast of the Polar Sea, he observed,
during an Aurora Borealis, certain portions of the vault of heaven which were not illuminated,
light up and continue luminous whenever a shooting star passed over them.

[footnote]  *Ferd. v. Wrangle, 'Reise lngs der Nordkste von Sibirien in den Jahren', 1820-1824,
th. ii., s. 259.  Regarding the recurrence of the denser swarm of the November stream after
an interval of thirty-three years, see Olbers, in 'Jahrb.', 1837, s. 280.  I was informed in
Cumana that shortly before the fearful earthquake of 1766, and consequently thirty-three years
(the same interval) before the great fall of stars on the 11th and 12th of November, 1799,
a similar fiery manifestation had been observed in the heavens.  But it was on the 21st of
October, 1766, and not in the beginning of November, that the earthquake occurred.  Possibly
some traveler in Quito may yet be able to ascertain the day on which the volcano of Cayambe,
which is situated there, was for the space of an hour enveloped in falling stars, so that the
inhabitants endeavored to appease heaven by religious processions.  ('Relat. Hist.', t. i.,
chap. iv., p 307; chap. x., p. 520 and 527.)

The different meteoric streams, each of which is composed of myriads of small cosmical bodies,
probably intersect our Earth's orbit in the same manner as Biela's comet.  According to this
hypothesis, we may represent to ourselves these asteroid-meteors as composing a closed ring
or zone, within which they all pursue one common orbit.  The s aller planets between Mars and
Jupiter present us if we except Pallas with an analogous relation in their constantly intersecting
orbits.  As yet, however, we have no certain knowledge as to whether changes in the periods
at which the stream becomes visible, or the 'retardations' of the phenomena of which I have
already spoken, indicate a regular precession of oscillation of the nodes -- that is to say,
of the points of intersection of the Earth's orbit and of that of the ring; or whether this
ring or zone attains so considerable a degree of breadth from the irregular grouping and distances
apart of the small bodies, that it requires several days for the Earth to traverse it.  The
system of Saturn's satellites shows us likewise a group of immense width, composed of most
intimately-connected cosmical bodies.  In this system, the orbit of the outermost (the seventh)
satellite has such a vast diameter, that the Earth, in her revolution round the Sun, requires
three days to traverse an extent of space equal to this diameter.  If, therefore, in one of
these rings, which we regard as the orbit of a periodical stream, the asteroids should be so
irregularly distributed as to consist of but few groups sufficiently dense to give rise to
these phenomena, we may easily understand why we so seldom witness such glorious spectacles
as those exhibited in the November months of 1799 and 1833.  The acute mind of Olbers led him
almost to predict that the next appearance of the phenomenon of shooting stars and fire-balls
intermixed, falling like flakes of snow, would not recur until between the 12th and 14th of
November, 1867.

p 128 The stream of the November asteroids has occasionally only been visible in a small section
of the Earth.  Thus, for instance, a very splendid 'meteoric shower' was seen in England in
the year 1837, while a most attentive and skillful observer at Braunsberg, in Prussia only
saw on the same night, which was there uninterruptedly clear, a few sporadic shooting stars
fall between seven o'clock in the evening and sunrise the next morning.  Bessel* concluded
from this "that a dense group of the bodies composing the great ring may have reached that
part of the Earth in which England is situated, while the more eastern districts of the Earth
might be passing at the time through a part of the meteoric ring proportionally less densely
studded with bodies."

[footnote]  *From a letter to myself, dated Jan. 24th, 1838.  The enormous swarm of falling
stars in November, 1799, was almost exclusively seen in America, where it was witnessed from
New Herrnhut in Greenland to the equator.  The swarms of 1831 and 1832 were visible only in
Europe, and those of 1833 and 1834 only in the United States of North America.

If the hypothesis of a regular progression or oscillation of the nodes should acquire greater
weight, special interest will be attached to the investigation of older observations.  The
Chinese annals, in which great falls of shooting stars, as well as the phenomena of comets,
are recorded, go back beyond the age of Tyrt¾s, or the second Messenian war.  They give a description
of two streams in the month of March, one of which is 687 years anterior to the Christian era.
Edward Biot has observed that among the fifty-two phenomena which he has collected from the
Chinese annals, those that were of most frequent recurrence are recorded at periods nearly
corresponding with the 20th and 22d of July, O.S., and might consequently be identical with
the stream of St. Lawrence's day, taking into account that it has advanced since the epochs*
indicated.

Filantes en Chine, in the 'Bull. de l'Acadmie de Bruxelles', 1843, t. x., No. 7, p. 8.  On
the notice from the 'Chronicon Ecclesi¾ Pragensis', see the younger Boguslawski, in Poggend.,
'Annalen', bd. xlviii., s. 612.

If the fall of shooting stars of the 21st of October, 1366, O.S. (a notice of which was found
by the younger Von Boguslawski, in Benessius de Horowic's 'Chronicon Ecclesi¾ Pragensis'),
be identical with our November phenomenon, although the occurrence in the fourteenth century
was seen in broad daylight, we find by the precession in 477 years that this system of meteors,
or, rather, its common center of gravity, must describe p 129 a retrograde orbit round the
Sun.  It also follows, from the views thus developed, that the non-appearance, during certain
years, in any portion of the Earth, of the two streams hitherto observed in November and about
the time of St. Lawrence's day, must be ascribed either to an interruption in the meteoric
ring, that is to say, to intervals occurring between the asteroid groups, or, according to
Poisson to the action of the larger planets* on the form and position of this annulus.

[footnote]  *"It appears that an apparently inexhaustible number of bodies, too small to be
observed, are moving in the regions of space, either around the Sun or the planets, or perhaps
even around their satellites.  It is supposed that when these bodies come in contact with our
atmosphere, the difference between their velocity and that of our planet is so great, that
the friction which they experience from their contact with the air heats them to incandescence,
and sometimes causes their explosion.  If the group of falling stars form an annulus around
the Sun, its velocity of circulation may be very different from that of our Earth; and the
displacements it may experience in space, in consequence of the actions of the various planets,
may render the phenomenon of its intersecting the planes of the ecliptic possible at some epochs,
and altogether impossible at others." -- Poisson, 'Recherches sur la Probabilit des Jugements',
p. 306, 307.

The solid masses which are observed by night to fall to the earth from fire-balls, and by day
generally when the sky is clear, from a cark small cloud, are accompanied by much candescence.
They undeniably exhibit a great degree of general identity with respect to their external form,
the character of their crust, and the chemical composition of their principal constituents.
These characteristics of identity have been observed at all the different epochs and in the
most various parts of the earth in which these meteoric stones have been found.  This striking
and early-observed analogy of physiognomy in the denser meteoric masses is, however, met by
many exceptions regarding individual points.  What differences, for instance, do we not find
between the malleable masses of for instance, do we not find between the malleable masses of
iron of Hradeschina in the district of Agram, those from the shores of the Sisim in the government
of Jeniseisk, rendered so celebrated by Pallas, or those which I brought from Mexico,* all
of which contain 96 per cent. of iron, from the arolites of Siena, in which the iron scarcely
amounts to 2 per cent., or the earthy arolite of Alais (in the Department du Gard), which
broke up in water, or, lastly, from those of Jonzac and Javenas, which contained no metallic
iron, but presented a p 130 mixture of oryctognostically distinct crystalline compoonents!

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Essai Politique sur la Nouv. Espagne' (2de dit.), t. iii. p. 310.

These differences have led mineralogists to separate these cosmical masses into two classes,
namely, those containing nickelliferous meteoric iron, and those consisting of fine or coarsely-granular
meteoric dust.  The crust or rind of arolites is peculiarly characteristic of these bodies,
being only a few tenths of a line in thickness, often glossy and pitch-like, and occasionally
veined.*

[footnote]  *The peculiar color of their crust was observed even as early as in the time of
Pliny (ii., 56 and 58):  "colore adusto."  The phrase "lateribus pluisse" seems also to refer
to the burned outer surface of arolites.

There is only one instance on record, as far as I am aware (the arolite of Chantonnay, in
La Vende), in which the rind was absent, and this meteor, like that of Juvenas, presented
likewise the peculiarity of having pores and vesicular cavities.  In all other cases the black
crust is divided from the inner light-gray mass by as sharply-defined a line of separation
as is the black leaden-colored investment of the white granit blocks* which I brought from
the cataracts of the Orinoco, and which are also associated with many other cataracts, as,
for instance, those of the Nile and of the Congo River.

[footnote]  * Humb., 'Rel. Hist.', t. ii., chap xx., p. 299-302.

The greatest heat employed in our porcelain ovens would be insufficient to produce any thing
similar to the crust of meteoric stones, whose interior remains wholly unchanged.  Here and
there, facts have been observed which would seem to indicate a fusion together of the meteoric
fragments; but, in general, the character of the aggregate mass, the absence of compression
by the fall, and the inconsiderable degree of heat possessed by these bodies when they reach
the earth, are all opposed to the hypothesis of the interior being in a state of fusion during
their short passage from the boundary of the atmosphere to our Earth.

The chemical elements of which these meteoric masses consist, and on which Berzelius has thrown
so much light, are the same as those distributed throughout the earth's crust, and are fifteen
in number, namely, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium, copper, arsenic, zinc, potash,
soda, sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon, constituting altogether nearly one third of all the
known simple bodies.  Notwithstanding this similarity with the primary elements into which
inorganic bodies are chemically reducible, the aspect of arolites, owing to the mode in which
their constituent parts are compounded, presents, generally, some features foreign to our telluric
rocks and minerals.  The pure native iron, which is almost always p 131 found incorporated
with arolites, imparts to them a peculiar, but not consequently, a 'selenic' character; for
in other regions of space, and in other cosmical bodies besides our Moon, water may be wholly
absent, and processes of oxydation of rare occurence.

Cosmical gelatinous vesicles, similar to the organic 'nostoc' (masses which have been supposed
since the Middle Ages to be connected with shooting stars), and those pyrites of Sterlitamak,
west of the Uralian Mountains, which are said to have constituted the interior of hailstones,*
must both be classed among the mythical fables of meteorology.

[footnote]  *Gustav Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. II., s. 202.

[footnote] *Gustav Rose, in Poggend., 'Ann.', 1825, bd. iv., x. 173-192. Rammelsberg, 'Erstes
Suppl. zum chem. Handwrterbuche der Mineralogie', 1843, s. 102.  "It is," says the clear-minded
observer Olbers, "a remarkable but hitherto unregarded fact, that while shells are found in
secondary and tertiary formations, no 'fossil meteoric stones' have as yet been discovered.
May we conclude from this circumstance that previous to the present and last modification of
the earth's surface no meteoric stones fell on it, although at the present time it appears
probable, from the researches of Schreibers, that 700 fall annually?"  (Olbers, in Schum.,
'Jahrb.', 1838, s. 329.)  Problematical nickelliferous masses of native iron have been found
in Northern Asia (at the gold-washing establishment at Petropawlowsk, eighty miles southeast
of Kusnezk), imbedded thirty-one feet in the ground, and more recently in the Western Carpathians
(the mountain chain of Magura, at Szlanicz), both of which are remarkably like meteoric stones.
Rammelsberg, 'Handwrterb., abth. ii., s. 25-28.

As meteoric olivine, like our basalt, contains from 47 to 49 per cent. of magnesia, constituting,
according to Berzelius, almost the half of the earthy components of meteoric stones, we can
not be surprised at the great quantity of silicate of magnesia found in these cosmical bodies.
If the zrolite of Juvenas contain separable crystals of augite and labradorite, the numerical
relation of the constituents p 132 render it at least probable that the meteoric masses of
Chateau-Renard may be a compound of diorite, consisting of hornblende and albite, and those
of Blansko and Chantonnay compounds of hornblende and labradorite.  The proofs of the telluric
and atmospheric origin of aUerolites, which it is attempted to base upon the oryctognostic
analogies presented by these bodies, do not appear to me to possess any great weight.

Recalling to mind the remarkable interview between Newton and Conduit at Kensington,* I would
ask why the elementary substances that compose one group of cosmical bodies, or one planetary
system, may not, in a great measure, be identical?

[footnote]  * "Sir Isaac Newton said he took all the planets to be composed of the same matter
with the Earth, viz., earth, water, and stone, but variously connected." -- Turner, 'Collections
for the History of Grantham, containing authentic Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton', p. 172.

Why should we not adopt this view, since we may conjecture that these planetary bodies, like
all the larger or smaller agglomerated masses revolving round the sun, have been thrown off
from the once far more expanded solar atmosphere, and been formed from vaporous rintgs describing
their orbits round the central body?  We are not, it appears to me, more justified in applying
the term telluric to the nickel and iron, the olivine and pyroxene (augite), found in meteoric
stones, than in indicating the German plants which I found beyond the Obi as European species
of the flora of Northern Asia.  If the elementary substances composing a group of cosmical
bodies of different magnitudes be identical, why should they not likewise, in obeying the laws
of mutual attraction, blend together under definite relations of mixture, composing the white
glittring snow and ice in the polar zones of the planet Mars, or constituting in the smaller
cosmical masses mineral bodies inclosing crystals of olivine, augite, and labradorite?  Even
in the domain of pure conjecture we should not suffer ourselves to be led away by unphilosophical
and arbitrary views devoid of the support of inductive reasoning.

Remarkable obscurations of the sun's disk, during which the stars have been seen at mid-day
(as, for instance, in the obscuration of 1547, which continued for three days, and occurred
about the time of the eventful battle of Mhlberg), can not be explained as arising from volcanic
ashes or mists, and were regarded by Kepler as owing either to a 'materia cometica', or to
a black cloud formed by the sooty exhalations of the solar body.  The shorter obscurations
of 1090 and 1203, which continued, the one only three, and the other six p 133 hours, were
supposed by Chladni and Schnurrer to be occasioned by the passage of meteoric masses before
the sun's disk.  Since the period that streams of meteoric shooting stars were first considered
with reference to the direction of their orbit as a closed ring, the epochs of these mysterious
celestial phenomena have been observed to present a remarkable connection with the regular
recurrence of swarms of shooting stars Adolph Erman has evinced great acuteness of mind in
his accurate investigation of the facts hitherto observed on this subject, and his researches
have enabled him to discover the connection of the sun's conjunction with the August asteroids
on the 7th of February, and with the November asteroids on the 12th of May, the latter period
corresponding with the days of St. Mamert (May 11th), St. Pancras (May 12th), and St. Servatius
(May 13th), which according to popular belief, were accounted "cold days."*

[footnote]  Adolph Erman, in Poggend., 'Annalen', 1839, bd. xlviii., s. 582-601.  Biot had
previously thrown doubt regarding the probability of the November stream reappearing in the
beginning of May ('Comptes Rendus', 1836, t. ii., p. 670).  Mdler has examined the mean depression
of temperature on the three ill-named days of May by Berlin observations for eighty-six years
('Verhandl. des Vereins zur Bedfrd, des Gartenbaues', 1834, s. 377), and found a retrogression
of temperature amounting to 2.2 degrees Fahr. from the 11th to the 13th of May, a period at
which nearly the most rapid advance of heat takes place.  It is much to be desired that this
phenomenon of depressed temperature, which some have felt inclined to attribute to the melting
of the ice in the northeast of Europe, should be also investigated in very remote spots, as
in America, or in the southern hemisphere.  (Comp. 'Bull. de l'Acad. Imp. de St. Ptersbourg',
1843, t. i., No. 4.)

The Greek natural philosophers, who were but little disposed to pursue observations, but evinced
inexhaustible fergility of imagination in giving the most various interpretation of half-perceived
facts, have, however, left some hypotheses regarding shooting stars and meteoric stones which
strikingly accord with the views now almost universally admitted of the cosmical process of
these phenomena.  "Falling stars," says Plutarch, in his life of Lysander,* are, according
to the opinion of some physicists, not eruptions of the ethereal fire extinguished in the air
immediately after its ignition, nor yet an inflammatory combustion of the air, which is dissolved
in large quantities in the upper regions of space, but these meteors are rather a fall of celestial
bodies, which, in consequence of a certain intermission in the rotatory force, and by the impulse
of some irregular movements, have been hurled down not only to the inhabited portions of the
Earth, but also beyond it into the great ocean, where we can not find them."

[footnote]  *Plut., 'Vit¾ par, in Lysandro', cap. 22.  The statement of Damachos (Damachos),
that for seventy days continuously there was a fiery cloud seen in the sky, emitting sparks
like falling stars, and which then, sinking nearer to the earth, let fall the stone of ®gos
Potamos, "which, however, was only a small part of it," is extremely improbable, since the
direction and velocity of the fire-cloud would in that case of necessity have to remain for
so many days the same as those of the earth; and this, in the fire-ball of the 19th of July,
1686, described by Halley ('Trans.', vol. xxix., p. 163), lasted only a few minutes.  It is
not altogether certain whether Damachos, the writer, [Greek words], was the same person as
Damachos of Plat¾a, who was sent by Selencus to India to the son of Androcottos, and who ws
charged by Strabo with being "a speaker of lies" (p. 70, Casaub.).  From another passage of
Plutarch ('Compar. Solonis c. Cop.', cap. 5) we should almost believe that he was.  At all
events, we have here only the evidence of a very late author, who wrote a century and a half
after the fall of arolites occurred in Thrace, and whose authenticity is also doubted by Plutarch.

Diogenes of Apollonia* expresses himself still more explicitly.

[footnote]  *Stob., ed. Heeren, i., 25, p. 508; Plut., 'de plac. Philos.', ii., 13.

According to his views, "Stars that are 'invisible', and, consequently, have no name, move
in space together with those that are visible.  These invisible stars frequently fall burning
at ®gos Potamos."  The Apollonian, who held all other stellar bodies, when luminous, to be
of a pumice-like nature, probably grounded his opinions regarding shooting stars and meteoric
masses on the doctrine of Anaxagoras the Clazomenian, who regarded all the bodies in the universe
"as fragments of rocks, which the fiery ether, in the force of its gyratory motion, had torn
from the Earth and converted into stars."  In the Ionian school, therefore, according to the
testimony transmitted to us in the views of Diogenes of Apollonia, arolites and stars were
ranged in one and the same class; both, when considered with reference to their primary origin,
being equally telluric, this being understood only so far as the Earth was then regarded as
a central body,* p 135 forming all things around it in the same manner was we, according to
our present views, suppose the planets of our system to have originated in the expanded atmosphere
of another central body, the Sun.

[footnote]  *The remarkable passage in Plut., 'de plac. Philos.', ii., 13, runs thus:  "Anaxagoras
teaches that the surrounding ether is a fiety substance, which, by the power of its rotation,
tears rocks from the earth, inflames them, and converts them into stars."  Applying an ancient
fable to illustrate a physical dogma, the Clazomenian appears to have ascribed the fall of
the Nem¾an Lion to the Peloponnesus from the Moon to such a rotatory or centrifugal force.
(®lian., xii., 7; Plut., 'de Facie in Orge Lun¾' c. 24; Schol. ex Cod. Paris., in 'Apoll. Argon.',
lib. i., p. 498, ed. Schaef., t. ii., p. 40; Meineke, 'Annal. Alex.', 1843, p. 85.)  Here,
instead of stones from the Moon, we have an animal from the Moon!  According to an acute remark
of Bckh, the ancient mythology of the Nem¾an lunar lion has an astronomical origin, and is
symbolically connected in chronology with the cycle of intercalation of the lunar year, with
the moon-worship at Nem¾a, and the games by which it was accompanied.

These views must not, therefore, be confounded with what is commonly termed the telluric or
atmospheric origin of meteoric stones, nor yet with the singular opinion of Aristotle, which
supposed the enormous mass of ®gos Potamos to have been raised by a hurricane. That rrogant
spirit of incredulity, which rejects facts without attempting to investigate them, is in some
cases almost more injurious than an unquestioning credulity.  Both are alike detrimental to
the force of investigation.  Notwithstanding that for more than two thousand years the annals
of different nations had recorded falls of meteoric stones, many of which had been attested
beyond all doubt by the evidence of irreproachable eye-witnesses -- notwithstanding the important
part enacted by the B¾tylia in the meteor-worship of the ancients -- notwithstanding the fact
of the companions of Cortez having see an arolite at Cholula which had fallen on the neighboring
pyramid -- notwithstanding that califs and Mongolian chiefs had caused swords to be forged
from recently-fallen meteoric stones -- nay, notwithstanding that several persons had been
struck dead by stones falling from heaven, as for instance, a monk at Crema on the 4th of September,
1511, another monk at Milan in 1650, and two Swedish sailors on board ship in 1674, yet this
great cosmical phenomenon remained almost wholly unheeded, and its intimate connection drawn
to the subject by Chladni, who had already gained immortal renown by his discovery of the sound-figures.
He who is penetrated with a sense of this mysterious connection, and whose mind is open to
deep impressions of nature, will feel himself moved by the deepest and most solemn emotion
at the sight of every star that shoots across the vault of heaven, no less than at the glorious
spectacle of meteoric swarms in the November phenomenon or on St. Lawrence's day.  Here motion
is suddenly revealed in the midst of nocturnal rest.  The still radiance of the vault of heaven
is for a moment animated with life and movement.  In the mild radiance left on the track of
the shooting star, imagination pictures the lengthened path of the meteor through the vault
of heaven, p 136 while, every where around, the luminous asteroids proclaim the existence of
one common material universe.

If we compare the volume of the innermost of Saturn's satellites, or that of Ceres, with the
immense volume of the Sun, all relations of magnitude vanish from our minds.  The extinction
of suddenly resplendent stars in Cassiopeia, Cygnus, and Serpentarius have already led to the
assumption of other and non-luminous cosmical bodies.  We now know that the meteoric asteroids,
spherically agglomerated into small masses, revolve round the Sun, intersect, like comets,
the orbits of the luminous larger planets, and become ignited either in the vicinity of our
atmosphere or in its upper strata.

The only media by which we are brought in connection with other planetary bodies, and with
all portions of the universe beyond our atmosphere, are light and heat (the latter of which
can scarcely be separated from the former),* and those mysterious powers of attraction exercised
by remote masses, according to the quantity of their constituents, upon our globe, the ocean,
and the strata of our atmosphere.

[footnote'  *The following remarkable passage on the radiation of heat from the fixed stars,
and on their low combustion and vitality -- one of Kepler's many aspirations -- occurs in the
'Paralipom. in Vitell. Astron. parsOpticqa', 1604, Propos. xxxii., p. 25:  "Luciis proprium
est calor, sydera omnia calefaciunt.  De syderum luce claritatis ratio testatur, calorem universorum
in minori esse proportione ad calorem unius solis, quam ut ab homine, cujus est certa caloris
mensura, utrque simul percipi et judicari possit.  De cincindularum lucula tenuissima negare
non potes, quin cum calore sit.  Vivunt enim et moventur, hoc auten non sine calefactione perficitur.
Sic neque putrescentium lignorum lux sui calore destituitur; nam ipsa puetredo quidam lentus
ignis est.  Inest et stirpibus suus calor." (Compare Kepler, 'Epit. Astron. Copernican¾', 1618,
t. i., lib. i., p. 35.)

Another and different kind of cosmical, or, rather, material mode of contact is, however, opened
to us, if we admit falling stars and meteoric stones to be planetary asteroids.  They not only
act upon us merely from a distance by the excitement of luminous or calorific vibrations, or
in obedience to the laws of mutual attraction, but they acquire an actual material existence
for us, reaching our atmosphere from the remoter regions of universal space, and remaining
on the earth itself.  Meteoric stones are the only means by which we can be brought in possible
contact with that which is foreign to our own planet.  Accustomed to gain our knowledge of
what is not telluric solely through measurement, calculations, and the deductions of reason,
we experience a sentiment of astonishment at finding that we may examine, weigh, and analyze
bodies that appertain p 137 to the outer world.  This awakens, by the power of the imagination,
a meditative, spiritual train of thought, where the untutored mind perceives only scintillations
of light in the firmament, and sees in the blackened stone that falls from the exploded cloud
nothing beyond the rough product of a powerful natural force.

Although the asteroid-swarms, on which we have been led, from special predilection, to dwell
somewhat at length, approximate to a certain degree, in their inconsiderable mass and the diversity
of their orbits, to comets, they present this essential difference from the latter bodies,
that our knowledge of their existence is almost entirely limited to the moment of their destruction,
that is, to the period when, drawn within the sphere of the Earth's attraction they become
luminous and ignite.

In order to complete our view of all that we have learned to consider as
appertaining to our solar system, which now, since the discovery of the
small planets, of the interior comets of short revolutions, and of the
meteoric asteroids, is so rich and complicated in its form, it remains for
us to speak of the ring of Zodiacal light, to which we have already alluded.
 Those who have lived for many years in the zone of palms must retain a
pleasing impression of the mild radiance with which the zodiacal light,
shooting pyramidally upward, illumines a part of the uniform length of
tropical nights.  I have seen it shine with an intensity of light equal to
the milky way in Sagittarius, and that not only in the rare and dry
atmosphere of the summits of the Andes, at an elevation of from thirteen to
fifteen thousand feet, but even on the boundless grassy plains, the Illanos
of Venezuela, and on the sea-shore, beneath the ever-clear sky of Cumana.
This phenomenon was often rendered especially beautiful by the passage of
light, fleecy clouds, which stood out in picturesque and bold relief from
the luminous back-ground.  A notice of this arial spectacle is contained
in a passage in my journal, while I was on the voyage from Lima to the
western coasts of Mexico:  "For three or four nights (between 10¼degrees
and 14¼degrees north latitude) the zodiacal light has appeared in greater
splendor than I have ever observed it.  The transparency of the atmosphere
must be remarkably great in this part of the Southern Ocean, to judge by the
radiance of the stars and nebulous spots.  From the 14th to the 19th of
March a regular interval of three quarters of an hour occurred between the
disappearance of the sun's disk in the ocean and the first manifestation of
the zodiacal
p 138
light, although the night was already perfectly dark. an hour after sunset
it was seen in great briliancy between Aldebaran and the Pleiades; and on
the 18th of March it attained an altitude of 39¼degrees5'minutes.  Narrow
elongated clouds are scattered over the beautiful deep azure of the distant
horizon, flitting past the zodiacal light as before a golden curtain.  Above
these, other clouds are from time to time reflecting the most brightly
variegated colors.  It seems a second sunset.  On this side of the vault of
heaven the lightness of the night appears to increase almost as much as at
the first quarter of the moon.  Toward 10 o'clock the zodiacal light
generally becomes very faint in this part of the Southern Ocean, and at
midnight I have scarcely been able to trace a vestige of it.  On the 16th of
March, when most strongly luminous a faint reflection was visible in the
east."  In our gloomy so-called "temperate" northern zone, the zodiacal
light is only distinctly visible in the beginning of Spring, after the
evening twilight, in the western part of the sky, and at the close of
Autumn, before the dawn of day, above the eastern horizon.

It is difficult to understand how so striking a natural phenomenon should have failed to attract
the attention of physicists and astronomers until the middle of the seventeenth century, or
how it could have escaped the observation of the Atabian natural philosophers in ancient Bactria,
on the euphrates, and in the south of Spain.  Almost equal surprise is excited by the tardiness
of observation of the nebulous spots in Andromeda and Orion, first described by Simon Marius
and Huygens.  The earliest explicit descriptions of the zodiacal light occurs in Childrey's
'Britannia Baconica',* in the year 1661. p 139

[footnote]  *"There is another thing which I recommend to the observation of mathematical men,
which is that in February, and for a little before and a little after that month (as I have
observed several years together), about six in the evening, when the twilight hath almost deserted
the horizon, you shall see a plainly discernible way of the twilight striking up toward the
Pleiades, and seeming almost to touch them.  It is so observed any clear night, but it is best
illac nocte.  There is no such way to be observed at any other time of the year (that I can
perceive), nor any other way at that time to be perceived darting up elsewhere; and I believe
it hath been, and will be constantly visible at that time of the year; but what the cause of
it in nature should be, I can not yet imagine, but leave it to future inquiry."  (Childrey,
'Britannia Baconica', 1661, p. 183.)  This is the first view and a simple description of the
phenomenon.  (Cassini, 'Dcouverte de la Lumi        dfd  leste qui parot dans le Zodiaque',
in the 'Mm. de l'Acad.', t. viii., 1730, p 276.  Mairan, 'TraitPhys de l'Aurore Borale',
1754, 0. 16.)  In this remarkable work by Childrey there are to be found (p. 91) very clear
accounts of the epochs of maxima and minima diurnal and annual temperatures, and of the retardation
of the extremes of the effects in meteorological processes.  It is, however, to be regretted
that our Baconian-philosophy-loving author, who was Lord Henry Somerset's chaplain, fell into
the same error as Bernardin de St. Pierre, and regarded the Earth as elongated at the poles
(see p. 148).  At the first he believes that the Earth was spherical, but supposes that the
uninterrupted and increasing addition of layers of ice at both poles has changed its figure;
and that as the ice is formed from water, the quantity of that liquid is every where diminishing.

The first observation of the phenomenon may have been made two or three years prior to this
period; but, notwithstanding, the merit of having (in the spring of 1683) been the first to
investigate the phenomenon in all its relations in space is incontestably due to Dominicus
Cassini.  The light which he saw at Bologna in 1668, and which was observed at the same time
in Persia by the celebrated traveler Chardin (the court astrologers of Ispahan called this
light, which had never before been observed, 'nyzek', a small lance), was not the zodiacal
light, as has often been asserted,* but the p 140 enormous tail of a comet, whose head was
concealed in the vapory mist of the horizon, and which, from its length and appearance, presented
much similarity to the great comet of 1843.

[footnote]  *Dominicus Cassini ('Mm. de l'Acad.', t. viii., 1730, p. 188), and Mairan ('Aurore
Bor.', p. 16), have even maintained that the phenomenon observed in Persia in 1668 was the
zodiacal light.  Delambre ('Hist. de l'Astron. Moderne', t. ii., p. 742), in very decided trms
ascribes the discovery of this light to the celebrated traveler Chardin; but in the 'Couronnement
de Soliman', and in several passages of the narrative of his travels (d. de Langls. t. iv.,
p. 326; t. x., p. 97), he only applies the term niazouk (nyzek), or "petite lance," to "the
great and famous comet which appeared over nearly the whole world in 1668, and whose head was
so hidden in the wewst that it could not be perceived in the horizon of Ispahan" ('Atlas du
Voyage de Chardin', Tab. iv.; from the observations at Schiraz).  The head or nucleus of the
comet was, however, visible in the Brazils and in India (Pingr, 'Comtogr.', t. ii., p. 22).
Regarding the conjectured identity of the last great comet of March, 1843, with this, which
Cassini mistook for the zodiacal light, see Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.', 1843, No. 476 and 480.
In Persian, the term "nizehi teschn"(fiery spears or lances) is also applied to the rays
of the rising or setting sun, in the same way as "nayzik," according to Freytag's Arabic Lexicon,
signifies "stell¾ cadentes."  The comparison of comets to lances and swords was, however, in
the Middle Ages, very common in all languages.  The great comet of 1500, which was visible
from April to June, was always termed by the Italian writers of that time 'il Signor Astone'
(see my 'Examen Critique de l'Hist. de la Gographie', t. v., p. 80).  All the hypotheses that
have been advanced to show that Descartes (Cassini, p. 230; Mairan, p. 16), and even Kepler
(Delambre, t. i., p. 601), were acquainted with the zodiacal light, appear to me altogether
untenable.  Descartes ('Principes', iii., art. 136, 137) is very obscure in his remarks on
comets, observing that their tails are formed "by oblique rays, which, falling on different
parts of the planetary orbs, strike the eye laterally by extraordinary refraction," and that
they might be seen morning and evening, "like a long beam," when the Sun is between the comet
and the Earth.  This passage no more refers to the zodiacal light than those in which Kepler
('Epit. Astron. Copernican¾', t. i., p. 57, and t. ii., p. 893) speaks of the existence of
a solar atmosphere (limbus circa solem, coma lucida), which, in eclipses of the Sun, prevents
it "from being quite night:" and even more uncertain, or indeed erroneous, is the assumption
that the "trabes quas [Greek word] vocant" (Plin., ii., 26 and 27) had reference to the tongue-shaped
rising zodiacal light, as Cassini (p. 231, art. xxxi.) and Mairan (p. 15) have maintained.
Every where among the ancients the trabes are associated with the bolides (ardores et faces)
and other fiery meteors, and even with long-barbed comets.  (Regarding [Greek words] . see
Schfer, 'Schol. Par. ad Apoll. Rhod.', 1813, t. ii., p. 206; Pseudo-Aristot., 'de Mundo, 2,
9; 'Comment. Alex. Joh. Philop. et Olymp. in Aristot. Meteor.', lib. i., cap. vii., 3, p. 195,
Ideler; Seneca, 'Nat. Qu¾st.', i., 1.)

We may conjecture, with much probability, that the remarkable light on the elevated plains
of Mexico, seen for forty nights consecutively i8n 1509, and observed in the eastern horizon
rising pyramidally from the earth, was the zodiacal light.  I found a notice of this phenomenon
in an ancient Aztec MS., the 'CodexTelleriano-Remensis',* preserved in the Royal Library at Paris.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Monumens des Peuples Indignes de l'Amrique', t. ii., p. 301.  The
rare manuscript which belonged to the Archbishop of Rheims, Le Tellier, contains various kinds
of extracts from an Aztec ritual, an astrological calendar, and historical annals, extending
from 1197 to 1549, and embracing a notice of different natural phenomena, epochs of earthquakes
and comets (as, for instance, those of 1490 and 1529), and of (which are important in relation
to Mexican chronology) solar eclipses.  In Camargo's manuscript 'Historia de Tlascala', the
light rising in the east almost to the zenith is, singularly enough, described as "sparkling,
and as if sown with stars."  The description of this phenomenon, which lasted forty days, can
not in any way apply to volcanic eruptions of Popcatepetl, which lies very near, in the southeastery
direction.  (Prescott, 'History of the Conquest of Mesico', vol. i., p. 284.)  Later commentators
have confounded this phenomenon, which Montezuma regarded as a warning of his misfortunes,
with the "estrella que humeava" (literally, 'which spring forth'; Mexican 'choloa, to leap
or spring forth').  With respect to the connection of this vapor with the star Citlal Choloha
(Venus) and with "the mountain of the star" (Citialtepetl, the volcano of Orizaba), see my
'Monumens', t. ii., p. 303.

This phenomenon, whose primordial antiquity can scarcely be doubted, and which was first noticed
in Europe by Childrey and Dominicus Cassini, is not the luminous solar atmosphere itself, since
this can not, in accordance with mechanical laws, be more compressed than in the relation of
2 to 3, and consequently can not be diffused beyond 9/20ths of Mercury's heliocentric distance.
These same laws teach us that the altitude of the extreme boundaries of the atmosphere of a
cosmical p 141 body above its equator, that is to say, the point at which gravity and centrifugal
force are in equilibrium, must be the same as the altitude at which a satellite would rotate
round the central body simultaneously with the diurnal revolution of the latter.*

[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 270; 'Mcanique Cleste', t. ii., p. 169
and 171; Schubert, 'Astr.', bd. iii., ¤ 206.

This limitation of the solar atmosphere in its present concentrated condition is especially
remarkable when we compare the central body of our system with the nucleus of other nebulous
stars.  Herschel has discovered several, in which the radius of the nebulous matter surrounding
the star appeared at an angle of 150".  On the assumption that the parallax is not fully equal
to 1", we find that the outermost nebulous layer of such a star must be 150 times further from
the central body than our Earth is from the Sun.  If, therefore, the nebulous star were to
occupy the place of our Sun, its atmosphere would not only include the orbit of Uranus, but
even extend eight times beyond it.¥

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 408.  Compare Sir John Herschel's considerations
on the volume and faintness of light of planetary nebul¾, in Mary Somerville's 'Connection
of the Physical Sciences', 1835, p. 108.  The opinion that the Sun is a nebulous star, whose
atmosphere presents the phenomenon of zodiacal light, did not originate with Dominicus Cassini,
but was first promulgated by Mairan in 1730 ('Trait de l'Aurore Bor.', p. 47 and 263; Arago,
in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 412).  It is a renewal of Kepler's views.

Considering the narrow limitation of the Sun's atmosphere, which we have just described, we
may with much probability regard the existence of a very compressed annulus of nebulous matter,*
revolving freely in space between the orbits of Venus and Mars, as the material cause of the
zodiacal light.

[footnote]  *Cominicus Cassini was the first to assume, as did subsequently Laplace, Schubert,
and Poisson, the hypothesis of a separate ring to explain the form of the zodiacal light. 
He says distinctly, "If the orbits of Mercury and Venus were visible (throughout their whole
extent), we should invariably observe them with the same figure and in the same position with
regard to the Sun, and at the same time of the year with the zodiacal light."  ('Mm. de l'Acad.',
t. viii., 1730, p. 218, and Biot, in the 'Comptes Rendus', 1836, t. iii., p. 666.)  Cassini
believed that the nebulous ring of zodiacal light consisted of innumerable small planetary
bodies revolving round the Sun.  He even went so far as to believe that the fall of fire-balls
might be connected with the passage of the Earth through the zodiacal nebulous ring.  Olmsted,
and especially Biot (op. cit., p. 673), have attempted to establish its connection with the
November phenomenon -- a connection which Olbers doubts.  (Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1837, s. 281.)
Regarding the question whether the place of the zodiacal light perfectly coincides with that
of the Sun's equator, see Houzeau, in Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.', 1843, No. 492, s. 190.

As p 142 yet we certainly know nothing definite regarding its actual material dimensions; its
augmentation* by emanations from the tails of myriads of comets that come within the Sun's
vicinity; the singular changes affecting its expansion, since it sometimes does not apper to
extend beyond our Earth's orbit; or, lastly, regarding its conjectural intimate connection
with the more condensed cosmical vapor in the vicinity of the Sun.

[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, 'Astron.', ¤ 487.

The nebulous particles composing this ring, and revolving round the sun in accordance with
planetary laws, may either be self-luminous or receive light from that luminary.  Even in the
case of a terrestrial mist (and this fact is very remarkable), which occurred at the time of
the new moon at midnight in 1743, the phosphorescence was so intense that objects could be
distinctly recognized at a distance of more than 600 feet.

I have occasionally been astonished in the tropical climates of south america, to observe the
variable intensity of the zodiacal light.  As i passed the nights, during many months, in the
open air, on the shores of rivers and on ilanos, i enjoyed ample opportunities of carefully
examining this phenomenon.  When the zodiacal light had been most intense, i have observed
that it would be perceptibly weakened for a few minutes, until it again suddenly shone forth
in full brilliancy.  In some few instances i have thought that i could perceive -- not exactly
a reddish coloration, nor the lower portion darkened in an arc-like form, nor even a scintillation,
as mairan affirms he has observed -- but a kind of flickering and wavering of the light.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 246.  Several physical facts
appear to indicate that, in a mechanical separation of matter into its
smallest particles, if the mass be very small in relation to the surface,
the electrical tension may increase sufficiently for the production of light
and heat.  Experiments with a large concave mirror have not hitherto given
any positive evidence of the presence of radiant heat in the zodiacal light.
 (Lettre de M. Matthiessen  M. Arago, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. xvi.,
1843, Avril, p. 687.)

Must we suppose that changes are actually in progress in the nebulous ring? or is it not more
probable that, although I could not, by my meteorological instruments, detect any change of
heat or moisture near the ground, and small stars of the fifth and sixth magnitudes appeared
to shine with equally undiminished intensity of light, processes of condensation may be going
on in the uppermost strata of the air, by means of which the transparency, or rather, the reflection
of light, may be modified in some peculiar and unknown manner? p 143 An assumption of the existence
of such meteorological causes on the confines of our atmosphere is strengthened by the "sudden
flash and pulsation of light," which, according to the acute observations of Olbers, vibrated
for several seconds through the tail of a comet, which appeared during the continuance of the
pulsations of light to be lengthened by several degrees, and then again contracted.*

[footnote]  *"What you tell me of the changes of light in the zodiacal light, and of the causes
to which you ascribe such changes within the tropics, is of the greatr interest to me, since
I have been for a long time past particularly attentive, every spring, to this phenomenon in
our northern latitudes.  I, too, have always believed that the zodiacal light rotated; but
I assumed (contrary to Poisson's opinion, which you have communicated to me) that it completely
extended to the Sun, with considerably augmenting brightness.  The light circle which, in total
solar eclipses, is seen surrounding the darkened Sun, I have regarded as the brightest portion
of the zodiacal light.  I have convinced my self that this light is very different in different
years, often for several successive years being very bright and diffused, while in othr years
it is scarcely perceptible.  I tyhink that I find the first trace of an allusion to the zodiacal
light in a letter from Rothmann to Tycho, in which he mentions that in the spring he has observed
the twilight did not close until the sun was 24¼degrees below the horizon.  Rothmann must certainly
have confounded the disappearance of the setting zodiacal light in the vapors of the western
horizon with the actual cessation of twilight.  I have failed to observe the pulsations of
the light, probably on account of the faintness with which it appears in these countries. 
You are, however, certainly right in ascribing those rapid variations in the light of the heavenly
bodies, which you have perceived in tropical climates, to our own atmosphere, and especially
to its higher regions.  This is especially in the clearest weather, that these tails exhibit
pulsations, commencing from the head, as being the lowest part, and vibrating in one or two
seconds through the entire tail, which thus appears rapidly to become some degrees longer,
but again as rapidly contracts.  That these undulations, which were formerly noticed with attention
by Robert Hooke, and in more recent times by Schrter and Chladni, 'do not actually occur in
the tails of the comets', but are produced by our atmosphere, is obvious when we recollect
that the individual parts of those tails (which are many millions of miles in length) lie 'at
very different distances' from us, and that the light from their extreme points can only reach
us at intervals of time which differ several minutes from one another.  Whether what you saw
on the Orinoco, not at intervals of seconds, but of minutes, were actual coruscations of the
zodiacal light, or whether they belonged exclusively to the upper strata of our atmosphere,
I will not attempt to decide; neither can I explain the remarkable 'lightness of whole nights',
nor the anomalous augmentation and prolongation of the twilight in the year 1831, particularly
if, as has been remarked, the lightest part of these singular twilights did not coincide with
the Sun's place below the horizon."  (From a lettr written by Dr. Olbers to myself, and dated
Bremen, Marth 26th, 1833.)

As, however, the separate particles of a comet's tail, measuring millions of miles, p 144 are
very unequally distant from earth, it is not possible, according to the laws of the velocity
and transmission of light, that we should be able, in so short a period of time, to perceive
any actual changes in a cosmical body of such vast extent.  There considerations in no way
exclude the realith of the changes that have been observed in the emanations from the more
condensed envelopes around the nucleus of a comet, nor that of the sudden irradiation of the
zodiacal light, from internal molecular motion, nor of the increased or diminished reflection
of light in the cosmical vapor of the luminous ring, but should simply be the means of drawing
our attention to the differences existing between that which appertains to the air of heaven
(the realms of universal space) and that which belongs to the strata of our terrestrial atmosphere.
It is not possible, as well-attested facts prove, perfectly to explain the operations at work
in the much-contested upper boundaries of our atmosphere.  The extraordinary lightness of whole
nights in the year 1831, during which small print might be read at midnight in the latitudes
of Italy and the north of Germany is a fact directly at variance with all that we know, according
to the most recent and acute researches on the crepuscular theory, and of the height of the
atmosphere.*

[footnote]  *Biot, 'Trait d'Astron. Physique', 3me d., 1841, t. i., p. 171, 238 and 312.

The phenomena of light depend upon conditions still less understood, and their variability
at twilight, as well as in the zodiacal light, excite our astonishment.

We have hitherto considered that which belongs to our solare system -- that world of material
forms governed by the Sun -- which includes the primary and secondary planets, comets of short
and long periods of revolution, meteoric asteroids, which move thronged together in streams,
either sporadically or in closed rings, and finally a luminous nebulous ring, that revolves
round the Sun in the vicinity of the Earth, and for which, owing to its position, we may retain
the name of zodiacal light.  Every where the law of periodicity governs the motions of these
bodies, however different may be the amount of tangential velocity, or the quantity of their
agglomerated material parts; the meteoric asteroids which enter our atmosphere from the external
regions of universal space are alone arrested in the course of their planetary revolution,
and retained within the sphere of a larger planet.  In the solar system, whose boundaries determine
the attractive force of the central body, comets are made to revolve in their elliptical p
145 orbits at a distance 44 times greater than that of Uranus; may, in those comets whose nucleus
appears to us, from its inconsiderable mass, like a mere passing cosmical cloud, the Sun exercises
its attractive force on the outermost parts of the emanations radiating from the tail over
a space of many millions of miles.  Central forces, therefore, at once constitute and maintain
the system.

Our Sun may be considered as at rest when compared to all the large and small, dense and almost
vaporous cosmical bodies tht appertain to and revolve around it; but it actually rotates around
the common center of gravity of the whole system, which occasionally falls within itself, that
is to say, remains within the material circumference of the Sun, whatever changes may be assumed
by the position of the planets.  A very different phenomenon is that presented by the translatory
motion of the Sun, that is, the progressive motion of the center of gravity of the whole solar
system in universal space.  Its velocity is such* that, according to Bessel, the relative motion
of the Sun, and that of 61 Cygni, is not less in one day than 3,336,000 geographical miles.

[footnote]  *Bessel, in Schum., 'Jahrb. fr' 1839, s. 51; probably four millions of miles daily,
in a relative velocity of at the least 3,336,000 miles, or more than couble the velocity of
revolution of the Earth in her orbit round the Sun.

This change of the entire solar system would remain unknown to us, if the admirable exactness
of our astronomical instruments of measurement, and the advancement recently made in the art
of observing, did not cause our advance toward remote stars to be perceptible, like an approximation
to the objects of a distant shore in apparent motion.  The proper motion of the star 61 Cygni,
for instance, is so considerable, that it has amounted to a whole degree in the course of 700
years.

The amount or quantity of these alterations in the fixed stars (that is to
say, the changes in the relative position of self-luminous stars toward each
other), can be determined with a greater degree of certainty than we are
able to attach to the genetic explanation of the phenomenon.  After taking
into consideration what is due to the precession of the equinoxes, and the
nutation of the earth's axis produced by the action of the Sun and Moon on
the spheroidal figure of our globe, and what may be ascribed to the
transmission of light, that is to say, to its aberration, and to the
parallax formed by the diametrically opposite position of the Earth in its
course round the Sun, we still find that there is a residual portion
p 146
of the annual motion of the fixed stars due to the translation of the whole
solar system in universal space, and to the true proper motion of the stars.
 The difficult problem of numerically separating these two elements, the
true and the apparent motion, has been effected by the careful study of the
direction of the motion of certain individual stars, and by the
consideration of the fact that, if all the stars were in a state of absolute
rest, they would appear perspectively to recede from the point in space
toward which the Sun was directing its course.  But the ultimate result of
this investigation, confirmed by the calculus of probabilities, is, that our
solar system and the stars both change their places in space.  According to
the admirable researches of d'Argelander at Abo, who has extended and more
perfectly developed the work begun by William Herschel and Prevost, the Sun
moves in the direction of the constellation Hercules, and probably, from the
combination of the observations made of 537 stars, toward a point lying (at
the equinox of 1792.5) at 257¼degrees 49.'7 R.A., and 28¼degrees 49.'7
N.D.  It is extremely difficult, in investigations of this nature, to
separate the absolute from the relative motion, and to determine what is
aloone owing to the solar system.*

[footnote]  *Regarding the motion of the solar system, according to Bradley, Tobias Mayer,
Lambert, Lalande, and William Herschel, see Arago in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 388-399' Argelander,
in Schum., 'Astron. Nachr ., No. 363, 364, 398, and in the treatise 'Von der eigenen Bewegung
des Sonnensystems' (On the proper Motion of the Solar System), 1837, s. 43, respecting Perseus
as the central body of the whole stellar stratum, likewise Otho Struve, in the 'Bull. de l'Acad.
de St. Ptersb.', 1842, t. x., No. 9, p. 137-139.  The last-named astronomer has found, by
a mo4re recent combination, 261¼degrees 23' R.A.+37¼degrees 36' Decl. for the direction of
the Sun's motion; and, taking the mean of his own results with that of Argelander, we have,
by a combination of 797 stars, the formula 259¼degrees 9' R.A.+34¼degrees 36' Decl.

If we consider the proper, and not the perspective motions of the stars, we shall find many
that appear to be distributed in groups, having an opposite direction; and facts hitherto observed
do not, at any rate, render it a necessary assumption that all parts of our starry stratum,
or the whole of the stellar islands filling space, should move round one large unknown luminous
or non-luminous central body.  The tendency of the human mind to investigate ultimate and highest
causes certainly inclines the intellectual activity, no less than the imagination of mankind,
to adopt such an hypothesis.  Even the Stagirite proclaimed that "every thing which is moved
must be referable to a motor, and that there would be no end to p 147 the concatenation of
causes if there were not one primordial immovable morot."*

[footnote]  *Aristot., 'de C¾lo', iii., 2, p. 301, Bekker:  'Phys.', viii., t, p. 256.  The
existence of these laws is revealed to us by many phenomena, as, for instance, by the motion
of double stars, and by the amount of retarded or accelerated motion in different parts of
their elliptic orbits. Human inquiry need no longer pursue this subject in the domain of vague
conjecture, or amid the undefined analogies of the ideal world; for even here the progress
made in the method of astronomical observations and calculations has enabled astronomy to take
up its position on a firm basis. It is not only the discovery of the astounding numbers of
double and multiple stars revolving round a center of gravity lying 'without' their system
(2800 such systems having been discovered up to 1837), but rather the extension of our knowledge
regarding the fundamental forces of the whole material world, and the proofs we have obtained
of the universal empire of the laws of attraction, that must be ranked among the most brilliant
discoveries of the age.  The periods of revolution of colored stars present the greatest differences;
thus, in some instances, the period extends to 43 years, as in ¹pi of Corona, and in others
to several thousands,, as in 66 of Cetus, 38 of Gemini, and 100 of Pisces.  Since Herschel's
measurements in 1782, the satellite of the nearest star in the triple system of [Greek letter]
of Cancer has completed more than one entire revolution.  By a skillful combination of the
altered distances and angles of position,* the elements of these orbits may be found, conclusions
drawn regarding the absolute distance of the double stars from the Earth, and comparisons made
between their mass and that of the Sun.

of the Astronom. Soc.', vol. v., p. 171.

Whether, however, here and in our solar system, quantity of matter is the only standard of
the amount of attractive force, or whether 'specific' forces of attraction proportionate to
the mass may not at the same time come into operation, as Bessel was the first to conjecture,
are questions p 148 whose practical solution must be left to future ages.*

Bewegung der Sonne entstchen' (An Investigation of the portion of the Planetary Disturbances
depending on the motion of the Sun) in 'Abh. der Berl. Akad. der Wissensch.', 1824 (Mathem.
Classe), s. 2-6.  The question has been raised by John Tobias Mayer, in 'Comment. Soc. Reg.
Gotting.', 1804-1808, vol. xvi., p. 31-68.

When we compare our Sun with the other fixed stars, that is, with other self-luminous Suns
in the lenticular starry stratum of which our system forms a part, we find, at least in the
case of some, that channels are opened to us, which may lead, at all events, to an 'approximate'
and limited knowledge of their relative distances, volumes, and masses, and of the velocities
of their translatory motion.  If we assume the distance of Uranus from the Sun to be nineteen
times that of the Earth, that is to say, nineteen times as great as that of the Sun from the
Earth, the central body of our planetary system will be 11,900 times the distance of Uranus
from the star 'a' in the constellation Centaur, almost 31,300 from 61 Cygni, and 41,600 from
Vega in the constellation Lyra.  The comparison of the volume of the Sun with that of the fixed
stars of the first magnitude is dependent upon the apparent diameter of the latter bodies --
an extremely undertain optical element.  If even we assume, with Herschel, that the apparent
diameter of Arcturus is only a tenth part of a second, it still follows that the true diameter
of this star is eleven times greater than that of the Sun.*

[footnote]  *'Philos. Trans.' for 1803, p. 225.  Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 375.  In
order to obtain a clearer idea of the distances ascribed in a rather earlier part of the text
to the fixed stars, let us assume that the Earth is a distance of one foot from the Sun; Uranus
is then 19 feet, and Vega Lyrae is 158 geographical miles from it.

The distance of the star 61 Cygni, made known by Bessel, has led approximately to a knowledge
of the quantity of matter contained in this body as a double star.  Notwithstanding that, since
Bradley's observations, the portion of the apparent orbit traversed by this star is not sufficiently
great to admit of our arriving with perfect exactness at the true orbit nd the major axis of
this star, it has been conjectured with much probability by the great Konigsberg astronomer,*
"that the mass of this double star can not be very considerably larger or smaller than half
of the mass of the Sun."

[footnote]  *Bessel, in Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1839, s. 53.

This result is from actual measurement.  The analogies deduced from the relatively larger mass
of those planets in our solar system that are attended by satellites, and from the fact that
Struve has discovered six times more double stars among p 194 the brighter than among the telescopic
fixed stars, have led other astronomers to conjecture that the average mass of the larger number
of the binary stars exceeds the mass of the Sun.*

[footnote]  *Mdler, 'Astron.', s. 476; also in Schum, 'Jahrb.', 1839, s. 95.

We are, however, far from having arrived at general results regarding this subject.  Our Sun,
according to Argenlander, belongs, with reference to proper motion in space, to the class of
rapidly-moving fixed stars.

The aspect of the starry heavens, the relative position of stars and nebullae, the distribution
of their luminous masses, the picturesque beauty, if I may so express myself, of the whole
firmament, depend in the course of ages conjointly upon the proper motion of the stars and
nebulae, the translation of our solar system in space, the appearance of new stars, and the
disappearance or sudden diminution in the intensity of the light of others, and lastly and
specially, on the changes which the Earth's axis experiences from the attraction of the Sun
and Moon.  The beautiful stars in the constellation of the Centaur and the Southern Cross will
at some future time be visible in our northern latitudes, while other stars, as Sirius and
the stars in the Belt of Orion, will in their turn disappear below the horizon.  The places
of the North Pole will successively be indicated by the stars § beta and a alpha Cephei, and
¶ delta Cygni, until after a period of 12,000 years, Vega in Lyra will shine forth as the brightest
of all possible pole stars.  These data give us some idea of the extent of the motions which,
divided into infinitely small portions of time, proceed without intermission in the great chronometer
of the universe.  If for a moment we could yield to the power of fancy, and imagine the acuteness
of our visual organs to be made equal with the extremest bounds of telescopic vision, and bring
together that which is now divided by long periods of time, the apparent rest that reigns in
space would suddenly disappear.  We should see the countless host of fixed stars moving in
thronged groups in different directions; nebulae wandering through space, and becoming condensed
and dissolved like cosmical clouds; the vail of the Milky Way separated and broken up in many
parts, and 'motion' ruling supreme in every portion of the vault of heave, even as on the Earth's
surface, where we see it unfolded in the germ, the leaf, and the blossom, the organisms of
the vegetable world.  The celebrated Spanish botanist Cavanilles was the first who entertained
the idea of "seeing grass grow," and he directed the horizontal micrometer threads of a powerfully
magnifying glass at one time to p 150 the apex of the shoot of a bambusa, and at another on
the rapidly-growing stem of an American aloe ('Agave Americana', precisely as the astronomer
places his cross of net-work against a culminating star.  In the collective life of physical
nature, in the organic as in the sidereal world, all things that have been, that are, and will
be, are alike dependent on motion.

The breaking up of the Milky Way, of which I have just spoken, requires special notice.  William
Herschel, our safe and admirable guide to this portion of the regions of space, has discovered
by his star-guagings that the telescopic breadth of the Milky Way extends from six to seven
degrees beyond what is indicated by our astronomical maps and by the extent of the sidereal
radiance visible to the naked eye.*

[footnote]  *Sir William Herschel, in the 'Philos. Transact.' for 1817, Part ii p. 438.

The two brilliant nodes in which the branches of the zone unite, in the region of Cepheus and
Cassiopeia, and in the vicinity of Scorpio and Sagittarius, appear to exercise a powerful attraction
on the contiguous stars; in the most brilliant part, however between beta and [Greek symbol]
Cygni, one half of the 330,000 stars that have been discovered in a breadth of 5 degrees are
directed toward one side, and the remainder to the other. It is in this part that Herschel
supposes the layer to be broken up.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 569

The number of telescopic stars in the Milky Way uninterrupted by any nebulae is estimated at
18 millions.  In order, I will not say, to realize the greatness of this number, but, at any
rate, to compare it with something analogous, I will call attention to the fact that there
are not in the whole heavens more than about 8000 stars between the first and the sixth magnitudes,
visible to the naked eye.  The barren astonishment excited by numbers and dimensions in space,
when not considered with reference to applications engaging the mental and perceptive powers
of man, is awakened in both extremes of the universe, in the celestial bodies as in the minutest
animalcules.*

Herschel on the starless space which separates us by a great distance from the Milky Way, in
the 'Philos. Transact.' for 1817, Part ii., p. 328.)

A cubic inch of the polishing slate of Bilin contains, according to Ehrenberg, 40,000 millions
of the silicious shells of Galionellae.

The stellar Milky Way, in the region of which, according to Argelander's admirable observations,
the brightest stars of the firmament appear to be congregated, is almost at right angles p
151 with another Milky Way, composed of nebulae.  The former constitutes, according to Sir
John Herschel's views, an annulus, that is to say, an independent zone, somewhat remote from
our lenticular-shaped starry stratum, and similar to Saturn's ring.  Our planetary system lies
in an eccentric direction, nearer to the region of the Cross than to the diametrically opposite
point, Cassiopeia.*

[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, 'Astronom.', 624; likewise in his 'Observations on Nebulae
and Clusters of Stars' ('Phil. Transact.', 1833, Part ii., p. 479, fig. 25):  "We have here
a brother system, bearing a real physical resemblance and strong analogy of structure to our own."

An imperfectly seen nebulous spot, discovered by Messier in 1774, appeared to present a remarkable
similarity to the form of our starry stratum and the divided ring of our Milky Way.*

[footnote]  *Sir William Herschel, in the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1785, Part i., p. 257.  Sir John
Herschel, 'Astron.', 616.  ("The 'nebulous' region of the heavens forms 'a nebulous Milky Way',
composed of distinct nebulae, as the other of stars."  The same observation was made in a letter
he addressed to me in March, 1829.)

The Milky Way composed of nebulae does not belong to our starry stratum, but surrounds it at
a great distance without being physically connected with it, passing almost in the form of
a large cross through the dense nebulae of Virgo, especially in the northern wing, through
Comae Berenicis, Ursa Major, Andromeda's girdle, and Pisces Boreales.  It probably intersects
the stellar Milky Way in Cassiopeia, and connects its dreary poles (rendered starless from
the attractive forces by which stellar bodies are made to agglomerate into groups) in the least
dense portion of the starry stratum.

We see from these considerations that our starry cluster, which bears traces in its projecting
branches of having been subject in the course of time to various metamorphoses, and evinces
a tendency to dissolve and separate, owing to secondary centers of attraction -- is surrounded
by two rings, one of which, the nebulous zone, is very remote, while the other is nearer, and
composed of stars alone.  The latter, which we generally term the Milky Way, is composed of
nebulous stars, averaging from the tenth to the eleventh degree of magnitude,* but appearing,
when considered individually, of very different magnitudes, while isolated starry clusters
(starry swarms) almost always exhibit throughout a character of great uniformity in magnitude
and brilliancy.

[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, 'Astron.', 585.

In whatever part the vault of heaven has been pierced by powerful and far-penetrating telescopic
instruments, stars or luminous nebulae are every where discoverable, the former, in p 152 some
cases, not exceeding the twentieth or twenty-fourth degree of telescopic magnitude.  A portion
of the nebulous vapor would probably be found resolvable into stars by more powerful optical
instruments.  As the retina retains a less vivid impression of separate than of infinitely
near luminous points, less strongly marked photometric relations are excited in the latter
case, as Arago has recently shown.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 282-285, 409-411, and 439-442.

The definite or amorphous cosmical vapor so universally diffused, and which generates heat
through condensation, probably modifies the transparency of the universal atmosphere, and diminishes
that uniform intensity of light which, according to Halley and Olbers, should arise, if every
point throughout the depths of space were filled by an infinite series of stars.*

[footnote]  *Olbers, on the transparency of celestial space, in Bode's 'Jahrb.', 1826, s. 110-121.

The assumption of such a distribution in space is, however, at variance with observation, which
shows us large starless regions of space, 'openings' in the heavens, as William Herschel terms
them -- one, four degrees in width, in Scorpio, and another in Serpentarius.  In the vicinity
of both, near their margin, we find unresolvable nebulae, of which that on the western edge
of the opening Scorpio is one of the most richly thronged of the clusters of small stars by
which the firmament is adorned.  Herschel ascribes these openings or starless regions to the
attractive and agglomerative forcesof the marginal groups.*

[footnote]  *"An opening in the heavens," William Herschel, in the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1785,

"They are parts of our starry stratum," says he, with his usual graceful animation of style,
"that have experienced great devastation from time."  If we picture to ourselves the telescopic
stars lying behind one another as a starry canopy spread over the vault of heaven, these starless
regions in Scorpio and Serpentarius may, I think, be regarded as tubes through which we may
look into the remotest depths of space.  Other stars may certainly lie in those parts where
the strata forming the canopy are interrupted, but these are unattainable by our instruments.
The aspect of fiery meteors had led the ancients likewise to the idea of clefts or openings
('chasmata') in the vault of heaven.  These openings were, however, only regarded as transient,
while the reason of their being luminous and fiery, instead of obscure, was supposed to be
owing to the p 153 translucent illuminated ether which lay beyond them.*

[footnote]  *Aristot., 'Meteor.', ii.,, 5, 1.  Seneca, 'Natur. Quaest.', i., 14, 2.  "Coelum
discessisse," in Cic., 'de Divin.', i., 43.

Derham, and even Huygens, did not appear disinclined to explain in a similar manner the mild
radiance of the nebulae.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 429.

When we compare the stars of the first magnitude, which, on an average, are certainly the nearest
to us, with the non-nebulous telescopic stars, and further, when we compare the nebulous stars
with unresolvable nebulae, for instance, with the nebula in Andromeda, or even with the so-called
planetary nebulous vapor, a fact is made manifest to us by the consideration of the varying
distances and the boundlessness of space, which shows the world of phenomena, and that which
constitutes its causal reality, to be dependent upon the 'propagation of light'.  The velocity
of this propagation is according to Struve's most recent investigations, 166,072 geographical
miles in a second, consequently almost a million of times greater than the velocity of sound.
According to the measurements of Maclear, Bessel, and Struve, of the parallaxes and distances
of three fixed stars of very unequal magnitudes ('a' Centauri, 16 Cygni, and 'a' Lyrae), a
ray of light requires respectively 3, 9 1/4, and 12 years to reach us from these three bodies.
In the short but memorable period between 1572 and 1604, from the time of Cornelius Gemma and
Tycho Brahe to that of Kepler, three new stars suddenly appeared in Cassiopeia and Cygnus,
and in the foot of Serpentarius.  A similar phenomenon exhibited itself at intervals in 1670,
in the constellation Vulpis.  In recent times, even since 1837, Sir John Herschel has observed,
at the Cape of Good Hope, the brilliant star [Greek symbol] in Argo increase in splendor from
the second to the first magnitude.*

[footnote]  *In December, 1837, Sir John Herschel saw the star [Greek
symbol] Argo, which till that time appeared as of the second magnitude, and
liable to no change, rapidly increase till it became of the first magnitude.
 In January, 1838, the intensity of its light was equal to that of 'a'
Centauri.  According to our latest information, Maclear in March, 1843,
found it as bright as Canopus; and even 'a' Crucis looked faint by [Greek
symbol] Argo.

These events in the universe belong, however, with reference to their historical reality, to
other periods of time than those in which the phenomena of light are first revealed to the
inhabitants of the Earth:  they reach us like the voices of the past.  It has been truly said,
that with our large and powerful telescopic instruments we penetrate alike through the boundaries
of time and space:  we measure the former through the latter, for in the course of an p 154
hour a ray of light traverses over a space of 592 millions of miles.  While according to the
theogony of Hesiod, the dimensions of the universe were supposed to be expressed by the time
occupied by bodies in falling to the ground ("the brazen anvil was not more than nine days
and nine nights in falling from heaven to earth"), the elder Herschel was of opinion* that
light required almost two millions of years to pass to the Earth from the remotest luminous
vapor reached by his forty-foot reflector.

[footnote]  *"Hence it follows that the rays of light of the remotest nebulae must have been
almost two millions of years on their way, and that consequently, so many years ago, this object
must already have had an existence in the sidereal heaven, in order to send out those rays
by which we now perceive it."  William Herschel, in the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1802, p. 498.  John
Herschel, 'Astron.', 590.  Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 334, 359, and 382-385.

Much, therefore, has vanished long before it is rendered visible to us -- much that we see
was once differently arranged from what it now appears. The aspect of the starry heavens presents
us with the spectacle of that which is only apparently simultaneous, and however much we may
endeavor, by the aid of optical instruments, to bring the mildly-radiant vapor of nebulous
masses or the faintly-glimmering starry clusters nearer, and diminish the thousands of years
interposed between us and them, that serve as a criterion of their distance, it still remains
more than probable, from the knowledge we possess of the velocity of the transmission of luminous
rays, that the light of remote heavenly bodies presents us with the most ancient perceptible
evidence of the existence of matter.  It is thus that the reflective mind of man is led from
simple premises to rise to those exalted heights of nature, where in the light-illumined realms
of space, "myriads of worlds are bursting into life like the grass of the night."*

[fotnote]  *From my brother's beautiful sonnet "Freiheit und Gesetz." (Wilhelm von Humboldt,
'Gesammelte Werke', bd. iv., s. 358, No. 25.)

From the regions of celestial forms, the domain of Uranus, we will now descend to the more
contracted sphere of terrestrial forces -- to the interior of the Earth itself.  A mysterious
chain links together both classes of phenomena.  According to the ancient signification of
the Titanic myth,* the powers of organic life, that is to say, the great order of nature, depend
upon the combined action of heaven and earth.

[footnote]  *Otfried Muller, 'Prolegomena', s. 373.

If we suppose that the Earth, like all the other planets, primordially belonged, according
to its origin, to the central body, the Sun, and to the solar atmosphere that has been separated
into nebulous p 155 rings, the same connection with this continguous Sun, as well as with all
the remote suns that shine in the firmament, is still revealed through the phenomena of light
and radiating heat.  The difference in the degree of these actions must not lead the physicist,
in his delineation of nature, to forget the connection and the common empire of similar forces
in the universe.  A small fraction of telluric heat is derived from the regions of universal
space in which our planetary system is moving, whose temperature (which according to Fourier,
is almost equal to our mean icy polar heat) is the result of the combined radiation of all
the stars.  The causes that more powerfully excite the light of the Sun in the atmosphere and
in the upper strata of our air, that give rise to heat-engendering electric and magnetic currents,
and awaken and genially vivify the vital spark in organic structures on the earth's surface,
must be reserved for the subject of our future consideration.

As we purpose for the present to confine ourselves exclusively within the telluric sphere of
nature, it will be expedient to cast a preliminary glance over the relations in space of solids
and fluids, the form of the Earth, its mean density, and the partial distribution of this density
in the interior of our planet, its temperature and its electro-magnetic tension.  From the
consideration of these relations in space, and of the forces inherent in matter, we shall pass
to the reaction of the interior on the exterior of our globe; and to the special consideration
of a universally distributed natural power -- subterranean heat; to the phenomena of earthquakes,
exhibited in unequally expanded circles of commotion, which are not referable to the action
of dynamic laws alone; to the springing forth of hot wells; and, lastly, to the more powerful
actions of volcanic processes.  The crust of the Earth, which may scarcely have been perceptibly
elevated by the sudden and repeated, or almost uninterrupted shocks by which it has been moved
from below, undergoes, nevertheless, great changes in the course of centuries in the relations
of the elevation of solid portions, when compared with the surface of the liquid parts, and
even in the form of the bottom of the sea. In this manner simultaneous temporary or permanent
fissures are opened, by which the interior of the Earth is brought in contact with the external
atmosphere.  Molten masses, rising from an unknown depth, flow in narrow streams along the
declivity of mountains, rushing impetuously onward, or moving slowly and gently, until the
fiery source is quenched in the midst of exhalations, and the lava becomes incrusted, as it
were, by p 156 the solidification of its outer surface.  New masses of rocks are thus formed
before our eyes, while the older ones are in their turn converted into other forms by the greater
or lesser agency of Platonic forces.  Even where no disruption takes place the crystalline
moleculres are displaced, combining to form bodies of denser texture.  The water presents structures
of a totally different nature, as, for instance, concretions of animal and vegetable remains,
of earthy, calcareous, or aluminous precipitates, agglomerations of finely-pulverized mineral
bodies, covered with layers of the silicious shields of infusoria, and with transported soils
containing the bones of fossil animal forms of a more ancient world.  The study of the strata
which are so differently formed and arranged before our eyes, and of all that has been so variously
dislocated, conforted, and upheaved, by mutual compression and volcanic force, leads the reflective
observer, by simple analogies, to draw a comparison between the present and an age that has
long passed.  It is by a combination of actual phenomena, by an ideal enlargement of relations
in space, and of the amount of active forces, that we are able to advance into the long sought
and indefinitely anticipated domain of geognosy, which has only within the last half century
been based on the solid foundation of scientific deduction.

It has been acutely remarked, "that notwithstanding our continual employment of large telescopes,
we are less acquainted with the exterior than with the interior of other planets, excepting,
perhaps, our own satellite."  They have been weighed, and their volume measured; and their
mass and density are becoming known with constantly-increasing exactness; thanks to the progress
made in astronomical observation and calculation.  Their physical character is, however, hidden
in obscurity, for it is only in our own globe that we can be brought in immediate contact with
all the elements of organic and inorganic creation.  The diversity of the most heterogenous
substances, their admixtures and metamorphoses, and the ever-changing play of the forces called
into action, afford to the human mind both nourishment and enjoyment, and open an immeasurable
field of observation, from which the intellectual activity of man derives a great portion of
its grandeur and power.  The world of perceptive phenomena is reflected in the depths of the
ideal world, and the richness of nature and the mass of all that admits of classification gradually
become the objects of inductive reasoning.

I would here allude to the advantage, of which I have already p 157 spoken, possessed by that
portion of physical science whose origin is familiar to us, and is connected with our earthly
existence.  The physical description of celestial bodies from the remotely-glimmering nebulae
with their suns, to the central body of our own system, is limited, as we have seen, to general
conceptions of the volume and quantity of matter.  No manifestation of vital activity is there
presented to our senses.  It is only from analogies, frequently from purely ideal combinations,
that we hazard conjectures on the specific elements of matter, or on their various modifications
in the different planetary bodies.  But the physical knowledge of the heterogeneous nature
of matter, its chemical differences, the regular forms in which its molecules combine together,
whether in crystals or granules; its relations to the deflected or decomposed waves of light
by which it is penetrated; to radiating, transmitted, or polarized heat; and to the brilliant
or invisible, but not, on that account, less active phenomena of electro-magnetism -- all this
inexhaustible treasure, by which the enjoyment of the contemplation of nature is so much heightened,
is dependent on the surface of the planet which we inhabit, and more on its solid than on its
liquid parts.  I have already remarked how greatly the study of natural objects and forces,
and the infinite diversity of the sources they open for our consideration, strengthen the mental
activity, and call into action every manifestation of intellectual progress.  These relations
require, however, as little comment as that concatenation of causes by which particular nations
are permitted to enjoy a superiority over others in the exercise of a material power derived
from their command of a portion of these elementary forces of nature.

If, on the one hand, it were necessary to indicate the difference existing between the nature
of our knowledge of the Earth and of that of the celestial regions and their contents, I am
no less desirous, on the other hand, to draw attention to the limited boundaries of that portion
of spacefrom which we derive all our knowledge of the heterogeneous character of matter.  This
has been somewhat inappropriately termed the Earth's crust; it includes the strata most contiguous
to the upper surface of our planet, and which have been laid open before us by deep fissure-like
valleys, or by the labors of man, in the bores and shafts formed by miners.  These labors*
do not extend beyond a vertical depth of somewhat more than 2000 feet (about one third of a
geographical mile) below the p 159 level of the sea, and consequently only about 1/9800th of
the Earth's radius.

[footnote]  *In speaking of the greatest depths within the Earth reached by
human labor, we must recollect that there is a difference between the
'absolute depth' (that is to say, the depth below the Earth's surface at
that point) and the 'relative depth' (or that beneath the level of the sea).
 The greatest relative depth that man has hitherto reached is probably the
bore at the new salt-works at Minden, in Prussia:  in June, 1814, it was
exactly 1993 feet, the absolute depth being 2231 feet.  The temperature of
the water at the bottom was 98 degrees F., which assuming the mean
temperature of the air at 49.3 degrees gives an augmentation of temperature
of 1 degree for every 54 feet.  The absolute depth of the Artesian well of
Grenelle, near Paris, is only 1795 feet.  According to the account of the
missionary Imbert, the fire-springs, "Ho-tsing." of the Chinese, which are
sunk to obtain [carbureted] hydrogen gas for salt-boiling, far exceed our
Artesian springs in depth.  In the Chinese province of Szu-tschuan these
fire-springs are very commonly of the depth of more than 2000 feet; indeed,
at Tseu-lieu-tsing (the place of continual flow) there is a Ho-tsing which,
in the year 1812, was found to be 3197 feet deep.  (Humboldt, 'Asie
Centrale', t. ii., p. 521 and 525.  The
boring at the new salt-works near Minden is probably of about the same
relative depth as the coal-mine at Apendale, near Newcastle-under-Lyme, in
Staffordshire, where men work 725 yards below the surface of the earth.
(Thomas Smith, 'Miner's Guide', 1836, p. 160.)  Unfortunately, I do not know
the exact height of its mouth above the level of the sea.  The relative
depth of the Monk-wearmouth mine, near Newcastle, is only 1496 feet.
(Phillips, in the 'Philos. Mag.', vol. v., 1834, p. 446.)  That of the Liege
coal-mine, 'l'Esperance' at Seraing, is, according to M. Gernaert, Ingenieur
des Mines, 1223 feet in depth.  The works of greatest absolute depth that
have ever been formed are for the most part situated in such elevated plains
or valleys that they either do not descend so low as the level of the sea,
or at most reach very little below it.  Thus the Eselchacht, at Kuttenberg,
in Bohemia, a mine which can not now be worked, had the enormous absolute
depth of 3778 feet.  (Fr. A. Schmidt, 'Berggestze der oter Mon.', abth. i.,
bd. i., s. xxxii.)  Also, at St. Daniel and at Geish, on the Rorerbubel, in
the 'Landgericht' (or provincial district) of Kitzbuhl, there were, in the
sixteenth century, excavations of 3107 feet.  The plans of the works of the
Rorerbubel are still preserved.  (See Joseph von Sperges, 'Tyroler
Bergwerksgeschichte', s. 121.  ("Exigua videtur terrae portio, quae unquam
hominibus spectanda emerget aut eruitur; cum profundinus in ejus viscera,
ultra efflorescentis extremitatis corruptelam, aut propter aquas in magnis
fodin, tanquam per venas scaturientesaut propter seris salubrioris ad vitam
operariorum sustinendam necessarii defectum, aut propter ingentex sumptus ad

partes penetrre non possumus; adeo ut quadrigentas aut [quod rarissime]
quingentas orgyas in quibusdam metallis descendisse, stupendus omnibus
videatur connatus." -- Guilielmi Gilberti, Colcestrensis, 'de Magnete
Physiologia nova'.  Lond., 1600, p. 40.)

[footnote continues]  The absolute depth of the mines in the Saxon Erzgebirge, near Freiburg,
are:  in the Thurmhofer mines, 1944 feet; in the Honenbirker mines, 1827 feet; the relative
depths are only 677 and 277 feet, if, in order to calculate the elevation of the mine's mouth
above the level of the sea, we regard the elevation of Freiburg as determined by Reich's recent
observations to be 1269 feet.  The absolute depth of the celebrated mine of Joachimsthal, in
Bohemia (Verkreuzung des Jung Hauer Zechen-und Andreasganges), is full 2120 feet; so that,
as Von Dechen's measurements show that its surface is about 2388 feet above the level of the
sea, it follows that the excavations have not as yet reached that point.  In the Harz, the
Samson mine at Andreasberg has an absolute depth of 2197 feet.  In what was formerly Spanish
America, I know of no mine deeper than the Valenciana, near Guanaxuato (Mexico), where I found
the absolute depth of the Planes de San Bernardo to be 1686 feet; but these planes are 5960
feet above the level of the sea.  If we compare the depth of the old Kuttenberger mine (a depth
greater than the height of our Brocken, and only 200 feet less than that of Vesuvius) with
the loftiest structures that the hands of man have erected (with the Pyramid of Cheops and
with the Cathedral of Strasburg), we find that they stand in the ratio of eight to one.  In
this note I have collected all the certain information I could find regarding the greatest
absolute and relative depths of mines and borings.  In descending eastward from Jerusalem toward
the Dead Sea, a view presents itself to the eye, which, according to our present hypsometrical
knowledge of the surface of our planet, is unrivaled in any country; as we approach the open
ravine through which the Jordan takes its course, we tread, with the open sky above us, on
rocks which, according to the barometric measurements of Berton and Russegger are 1385 feet
below the level of the Mediterranean.  (Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', th. ii., p. 323.)

The crystalline masses that have been erupted from active volcanoes, and are generally similar
to the rocks on the upper surface, have come from depths which, although not accurately determined,
must certainly be sixty times greater than those to which human labor has been enabled to penetrate.
We are able to give in numbers the depth of the shaft where the strata of coal, after penetrating
a certain way, rise again at a distance that admits of being accurately defined by measurements.
These dips show that the carboniferous strata, together with the fossil organic remains which
they contain, must lie, as, for instance, in Belgium, more than five or six thousand feet*
below the present level p 160 of the sea, and that the calcareous and the curved strata of
the Devonian basin penetrate twice that depth.

[footnote]  *Basin-shaped curved strata, which dip and reappear at measureable distances, although
their deepest portions are beyond the reach of the miner, afford sensible evidence of the nature
of the earth's crust at great depths below its surface.  Testimony of this kind possesses,
consequently, a great geognostic interest.  I am indebted to that excellent geognosist, Von
Dechen, for the following observations.  "The depth of the coal basin of Liege, at Mont St.
Gilles, which I, in conjunction with our friend Von Oeynhausen, have ascertained to be 3890
feet below the surface, extends 3464 feet below the surface of the sea, for the absolute height
of Mont St. Gilles certainly does not much exceed 400 feet; the coal basin of Mons is fully
1865 feet deeper.  But all these depths are trifling compared with those which are presented
by the coal strata of Saar-Revier (Saarbrucken).  I have found after repeated examinations,
that the lowest coal stratum which is known in the neighborhood of Duttweiler, near Bettingen,
northeast of Saarlouis, must descend to depths of 20,682 and 22,015 feet (or 3.6 geographical
miles) below the level of the sea."  This result exceeds, by more than 8000 feet, the assumption
made in the text regarding the basin of the Devonian strata.  This coal-field is therefore
sunk as far below the surface of the sea as Chimborazo is elevated above it -- at a depth at
which the Earth's temperature must be as high as 435¼degrees F.  Hence, from the highest pinnacles
of the Himalaya to the lowest basins containing the vegetation of an earlier world, there is
a vertical distance of about 48,000 feet, or of the 435th part of the Earth's radius.

If we compare these subterranean basins with the summits of montains that have hitherto been
considered as the most elevated portions of the raised crust of the Earth, we obtain a distance
of 37,000 feet (about seven miles), that is, about the 1/524th of the Earth's radius.  These,
therefore, would be the limits of vertical depth and of the superposition of mineral strata
to which geognostical inquiry could penetrate, even if the general elevation of the upper surface
of the earth were equal to the height of the Dhawalagigi in the Himalaya, or of the Sorata
in Bolivia.  All that lies at a greater depth below the level of the sea than the shafts or
the basins of which I have spoken, the limits to which man's labors have penetrated, or than
the depths to which the sea has in some few instances been sounded (Sir James Ross was unable
to find bottom with 27,600 feet of line), is as much unknown to us as the interior of the other
planets of our solar system.  We only know the mass of the whole Earth and its mean density
by comparing it with the open strata, which alone are accessible to us.  In the interior of
the Earth, where all knowledge of its chemical and mineralogical character fails, we are again
limited to as pure conjecture, as in the remotest bodies that revolve round the Sun.  We can
determine nothing with certainty regarding the depth at which the geological strata must be
supposed to be in state of softening or of liquid fusion, of the cavities occupied by elastic
vapor, of the condition of fluids when heated under an enormous pressure, or of the law of
the increase p 161 of density from the upper surface to the center of the Earth.

The consideration of the increase of heat with the increase of depth toward the interior of
our planet, and of the reaction of the interior on the external crust, leads us to the long
series of volcanic phenomena.  These elastic forces are manifested in earthquakes, eruptions
of gas, hot wells, mud volcanoes and lava currents from craters of eruption and even in producing
alterations in the level of the sea.*

[footnote]  * [See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', 2d edit., 3848, p. 539, etc., on the so called
'mud volcanoes', and the reasons advanced in favor of adopting the term "salses" to designate
these phenomena.] -- Tr.

Large plains and variously indented continents are raised or sunk, lands are separated from
seas, and the ocean itself, which is permeated by hot and cold currents, coagulates at both
poles, converting water into dense masses of rock, which are either stratified and fixed, or
broken up into floating banks.  The boundaries of sea and land, of fluids and solids, are thus
variously and frequently changed.  Plains have undergone oscillatory movements, being alternately
elevated and depressed.  After the elevation of continents, mountain chains were raised upon
long fissures, mostly parallel, and in that case, probably cotemporaneous; and salt lakes and
inland seas, long inhabited by the same creatures, were forcibly separated, the fossil remains
of shells and zoophytes still giving evidence of their original connection.  Thus, in following
phenomena in their mutual dependence, we are led from the consideration of the forces acting
in the interior of the Earth to those which cause eruptions on its surface, and by the pressure
of elastic vapors give rise to burning streams of lava that flow from open fissures.

The same powers that raised the chains of the Andes and the Hiimalaya to the regions of perpetual
snow, have occasioned new compositions and new textures in the rocky masses, and have altered
the strata which had been previously deposited from fluids impregnated with organic substances.
We here trace the series of formations, divided and superposed according to their age, and
depending upon the changes of configuration of the surface, the dynamic relations of upheaving
forces, and the chemical action of vapors issuing from the fissures.

The form and distribution of continents, that is to say, of that solid portion of the Earth's
surface which is suited to the luxurious development of vegetable life, are associated by intimate
connection and reciprocal action with the encircling p 162 sea in which organic life is almost
entirely limited to the animal world. The liquid element is again covered by the atmosphere,
an arial ocean in which the mountain chains and high plains of the dry land rise like shoals,
occasioning a variety of currents and changes of temperature, collecting vapor from the region
of clouds, and distributing life and motion by the action of the streams of water which flow
from their declivities.

While the geography of plants and animals depends on these intricate relations of the distribution
of sea and land, the configuration of the surface, and the direction of isothermal lines (or
zones of equal mean annual heat), we find that the case is totally different when we consider
the human race -- the last and noblest subject in a physical description of the globe.  The
characteristic differences in races, and their relative numerical distribution over the Earth's
surface, are conditions affected not by natural relations alone, but at the same time and specially,
by the progress of civilization, and by moral and intellectual cultivation on which depends
the political superiority that distinguishes national progress. Some few races, clinging, as
it were, to the soil, are supplanted and ruined by the dangerous vicinity of others more civilized
than themselves, until scarce a trace of their existence remains.  Other races, again, not
the strongest in numbers, traverse the liquid element, and thus become the first to acquire,
although late, a geographical knowledge of at least the maritime lands of the whole surface
of our globe, from pole to pole.

I have thus, before we enter on the individual characters of that portion of the delineation
of nature which includes the sphere of telluric phenomena, shown generally in what manner the
consideration of the form of the Earth and the incessant action of electro-magnetism and subterranean
heat may enable us to embrace in one view the relations of horizontal expansion and elevation
on the Earth's surface, the geognostic type of formations, the domain of the ocean (of the
liquid portions of the Earth), the atmosphere with its meteorological processes, the geographical
distribution of plants and animals, and, finally, the physical gradations of the human race,
which is, exclusively and every where, susceptible of intellectual culture.  This unity of
contemplation presupposes a connection of phenomena according to their internal combination.
A mere tabular arrangement of these facts would not fulfill the object I have proposed to myself,
and would not satisfy that requirement for cosmical presentation awakened in me by the p 163
aspect of nature in my journeyings by sea and land, by the careful study of forms and forces,
and by a vivid impression of the unity of nature in the midst of the most varied portions of
the Earth.  In the rapid advance of all branches of physical science, much that is deficient
in this attempt will, perhaps, at no remote period, be corrected and rendered more perfect,
for it belongs to the history of the development of knowledge that portions which have long
stood isolated become gradually connected, and subject to higher laws.  I only indicate the
empirical path in which I and many others of similar pursuits with myself are advancing, full
of expectation that, as Plato tells us Socrates once desired, "Nature may be interpreted by
reason alone."*

[footnote]  *Plato, 'Phaedo', p. 97.  (Arist., 'Metaph.', p. 985.)  compare Hegel, 'Philosophie
der Geschichte', 1840, s. 16.

The delineation of the principal characteristics of telluric phenomena must begin with the
form of our planet and its relations in space.  Here too, we may say that it is not only the
mineralogical character of rocks, whether they are crystalline, granular, or densely fossiliferous,
but the geometrical form of the Earth itself, which indicates the mode of its origin, and is,
in fact, its history.  An elliptical spheroid of revolution gives evidence of having once been
a soft or fluid mass.  Thus the Earth's compression constitutes one of the most ancient geognostic
events, as every attentive reader of the book of nature can easily discern; and an analogous
fact is presented in the case of the Moon, the perpetual direction of whose axes toward the
Earth, that is to say, the increased accumulation of matter on that half of the Moon which
is turned toward us, determines the relations of the periods of rotation and revolution, and
is probably contemporaneous with the earliest epoch in the formative history of this satellite.
The mathematical figure of the Earth is that which it would have were its surface covered entirely
by water in a state of rest; and it is this assumed form to which all geodesical measurements
of degrees refer.  This mathematical surface is different from that true physical surface which
is affected by all the accidents and inequalities of the solid parts.*

[footnote]  *Bessel, 'Allgemeine Betrachtungen uber Gradmessungen nach astronomisch-geodtischen
Arbeiten', at the conclusion of Bessel and Baeyer, 'Gradmessung in Ostpreussen', s. 427.  Regarding
the accumulation of matter on the side of the Moon turned toward us (a subject noticed in an
earlier part of the text), see Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 308.

The whole figure of the Earth is determined when we know the amount of the p 164 compression
at the poles and the equatorial diameter; in order, however, to obtain a perfect representation
of its form it is necessary to have measurements in two directions, perpendicular to one another.

Eleven measurements of degrees (or determinations of the curvature of the Earth's surface in
different parts), of which nine only belong to the present century, have made us acquainted
with the size of our globe, which Pliny names "a point in the immeasurable universe."*

[footnote]  *Plin., ii., 68.  Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest., Praef., c. ii. "El mundo espoco" (the
Earth is small and narrow), writes Columbus from Jamaica to Queen Isabella on the 7th of July,
1503:  not because he entertained the philosophic views of the aforesaid Romans, but because
it appeared advantageous to him to maintain that the journey from Spain was not long, if, as
he observes, "we seek the east from the west."  Compare my 'Examen Crit. de l'Hist. de la Geogr.
du 15 me Siecle', t.i., p. 83, and t. ii., p. 327, where I have shown that the opinion maintained
by Delisle, Freret, and Gosselin, that the excessive differences in the statements regarding
the Earth's circumference, found in the writings of the Greeks, are only apparent, and dependent
on different values being attached to the stadia, was put forward as early as 1495 by Jaime
Ferrer, in a proposition regarding the determination of the line of demarkation of the papal
dominions.

If these measurements do not always accord in the curvatures of different meridians under the
same degree of latitude, this very circumstance speaks in favor of the exactness of the instruments
and the methods employed, and of the accuracy and the fidelity to nature of these partial results.
The conclusion to be drawn from the increase of forces of attraction (in the direction from
the equator to the poles) with respect to the figure of a planet is dependent on the distribution
of density in its interior.  Newton, from theoretical principles, and perhaps likewise  prompted
by Cassini's discovery, previously to 1666, of the compression of Jupiter,* determined, in
his immortal work, 'Philosophiae Naturalis Principia', that the compression of the Earth, as
a homogeneous mass, was 1/230th.

[footnote]  *Brewster, 'Life of Sir Isaac Newton', 1831, p. 162.  "The discovery of the spheroidal
form of Jupiter by Cassini had probably directed the attention of Newton to the determination
of its cause, and consequently, to the investigation of the true figure of the Earth."  Although
Cassini did not announce the amount of the compression of Jupiter (1/15th) till 1691 ('Anciens
Memoires de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. ii., p. 108), yet we know from Lalande ('Astron.', 3me
ed., t. iii., p. 335) that Moraldi possessed some printed sheets of a Latin work, "On the Spots
of the Planets," commenced by Cassini, from which it was obvious that he was aware of the compression
of Jupiter before the year 1666, and therefore at least twenty-one years before the publication
of Newton's 'Principia'.

Actual mesurements, p 165 made by the aid of new and more perfect analysis, have, however,
shown that the compression of the poles of the terrestrial spheroid, when the density of the
strata is regarded as increasing toward the center, is very nearly 1/300th.

Three methods have been employed to investigate the curvature of the Earth's surface, viz.,
measurements of degrees, oscillations of the pendulum, and observations of the inequalities
in the Moon's orbit.  The first is a direct geometrical and astronomical method, while in the
other two we determine from accurately observed movements the amount of  the forces which occasion
those movements, and from these forces we arrive at the cause from whence they have originated,
viz., the compression of our terrestrial spheroid.  In this part of my delineation of nature,
contrary to my usual practice, I have instanced methods because their accuracy affords a striking
illustration of the intimate connection existing among the forms and forces of natural phenomena,
and also because their application has given occasion to improvements in the exactness of instruments
(as those employed in the measurements of space) in optical and chronological observations;
to greater perfection in the fundamental branches of astronomy and mechanics in respect to
lunar motion and to the resistance experienced by the oscillations of the pendulum; and to
the discovery of new and hitherto untrodden paths of analysis.  With the exception of the investigations
of the parallax of stars, which led to the discovery of aberration and nutation, the history
of science presents no problem in which the object attained -- the knowledge of the compression
and of the irregular form of our planet -- is so far exceeded in importance by the incidental
gain which has accrued, through a long and weary course of investigation, in the general furtherance
and improvement of the mathematical and astronomical sciences.  The comparison of eleven measurements
of degrees (in which are included three extra-European, namely, the old Peruvian and two East
Indian) gives, according to the most strictly theoretical requirements allowed for by Bessel,*
a compression p 166 of 1/299th.

[footnote]  *According to Bessel's examination of ten measurements of degrees, in which the
error discovered by Poissant in the calculation of the French measurements is taken into consideration
(Schumacher, 'Astron. Nachr.', 1841, No. 438, s. 116), the semi-axis major of the elliptical
spheroid of revolution to which the irregular figure of the Earth most closely approximates
is 3,272,077.14 toises, or 20,924,774 feet; the semi-axis minor, 3,261,159,83 toises, or 20,854,821
feet; and the amount of compression or eccentricity 1/299.152d; the length of a mean degree
of the meridian, 57,013.109 toises, or 364,596 feet, with an error of + 2.8403 toises, or 18.16
feet, whence the length of a geographical mile is 3807.23 toises, or 6086.7 feet.  Previous
combinations of measurements of degrees varied between 1/302d and 1/297th; thus Walbeck ('De
Forma of Magnitudine telluris in demensis arcubus Meridiani definiendis', 1819) gives 1/30278th:
Ed. Schmidt ('Lehrbuch der Mathem. und Phys. Geographie', 1829, s. 5) gives 1/20742d, as the
mean of seven measures.  Respecting the influence of great differences of longitude on the
polar compression, see 'Bibliotheque Universelle', t. xxxiii., p. 181, and t. xxxv., p. 50:
likewise 'Connaissance des Tems', 1829, p. 290.  From the lunar inequalities alone, Laplace
('Exposition du Syst. du Monde', p. 229) found it, by the older tables of Burg, to be 1/3245th;
and subsequently, from the lunar observations of Burckhardt and Bouvard, he fixed it at 1/299.1th
('Mecanique Celeste', t. v., p. 13 and 43).

In accordance with this, the polar radius is 10,938 toises (69,944 feet), or about 11 1/2 miles,
shorter than the equatorial radius of our terrestrial spheroid.  The excess at the equator
in consequence of the curvature of the upper surface of the globe amounts, consequently, in
the direction of gravitation, to somewhat more than 4 3/7th times the height of Mont Blanc,
or only 2 1/2 times the probable height of the summit of the Chawalagiri, in the Himalaya chain.
The lunar inequalities (perturbation in the moon's latitude and longitude) give according to
the last investigations of Laplace, almost the same result for the ellipticity as the measurements
of degrees, viz., 1/299th.  The results yielded by the oscillation of the pendulum give, on
the whole, a much greater amount of compression, viz., 1/288th.*

[footnote]  *The oscillations of the pendulum give 1/288.7th as the general result of Sabine's
great expedition (1822 and 1823, from the equator to 80 degrees north latitude); according
to Freycinet, 1/286.2d, exclusive of the experiments instituted at the Isle of France, Guam,
and Mowi (Mawi); according to Forster, 1/289.5th; according to Duperrey, 1/266.4th; and according
to Lutke ('Partie Nautique', 1836, p. 232), 1/270th, calculated from eleven stations.  On the
other hand, Mathieu ('Connais. des Temps', 1816, p. 330) fixed the amount at 1/298.2d, from
observations made between Formentera and Dunkirk; and Biot, at 1/304th, from observations between
Formentera and the island of Ust.  Compare Baily, 'Report on Pendulum Experiments', in the
'Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society', vol. vii., p. 96; also Borenius, in the 'Bulletin
de l'Acad. de St. Petersbourg', 1843, t. i., p. 25.  The first proposal to apply the length
of the pendulum as a standard of measure, and to establish the third part of the seconds pendulum
(then supposed to be every where of equal length) as a 'pes horarius', or general measure,
that might be recovered at any age and by all nations, is to be found in Huygens's 'Horologium
Oscillatorium', 1673, Prop. 25.  A similar wish was afterward publicly expressed, in 1742,
on a monument erected at the equator by Bouguer, La Condamine, and Godin.  On the beautiful
marble tablet which exists, as yet uninjured, in the old Jesuits' College at Quito, I have
myself read the inscription, 'Penduli simplicis aequinoctialis unius minuti secundi archetypus,
mensurae naturalis exemplar, utinam universalis!'  From an observation made by La Condamine,
in his 'Journal du Voyage a l'Equateur', 1751, p. 163, regarding parts of the inscription that
were not filled up, and a slight difference between Bonguer and himself respecting the numbers,
I was led to expect that I should find considerable discrepancies between the marble tablet
and the inscription as it had been described in Paris; but, after a careful comparison, I merely
found two "ex arca graduum plusquam trium," and the date of 1745 instead of 1742.  The latter
circumstance is singular, because La Condamine returned to Europe in November, 1744, Bouguer
in June of the same year, and Godin had left South America in July, 1744.  The most necessary
and useful amendment to the numbers on this inscription would have been the astronomical longitude
of Quito.  (Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Observ. Astron.', t. ii., p. 319-354.)  Nouet's latitudes,
engraved on Egyptian monuments, offer a more recent example of the danger presented by the
grave perpetuation of false or careless results.

Galileo, who first observed when a boy (having, probably, suffered his thoughts to wander from
the service) that the height of the vaulted roof of a church might be measured by the time
of the vibration of the chandeliers suspended at different altitudes, could hardly have anticipated
that the pendulum would one day be carried from pole to pole, in order to determine the form
of the Earth, or, rather, that the unequal density of the strata of the Earth affects the length
of the seconds pendulum by means of intricate forces of local attraction, which are, however,
almost regular in large tracts of land.  These geognostic relations of an instrument intended
for the measurement of time -- this property of the pendulum, by which, like a sounding line,
it searches unknown depths, and reveals in volcanic islands,* or in the declivity of elevated
continental mountain chains,** dense masses of basalt and melaphyre instead of cavities, render
it difficult, notwithstanding the admirable simplicity of the method, to arrive at any great
result regarding the figure of the Earth from observation of the oscillations of the pendulum.

[footnote]  *Respecting the augmented intensity of the attraction of gravitation in volcanic
islands (St. Helena, Ualan, Fernando de Noronha, Isle of France, Guam, Mowe, and Galapagos),
Rawak (Lutke, p. 240) being an exception, probably in consequence of its proximity to the highland
of New Guinea, see Mathieu, in Delambre, 'Hist. de l'Astronomie, au 18me Siecle', p. 701.

[footnote]  **Numerous observations also show great irregularities in the
length of the pendulum in the midst of continents, and which are ascribed to
local attractions.  (Delambre, 'Mesure de la Meridienne', t. iii., p. 548;
Biot, in the 'Mem. de l'Academie des Sciences', t. viii., 1829, p. 18 and
23.)  In passing over the South of France and Lombardy from west to east, we
find the minimum intensity of gravitation at Bordeaux; from thence it
increases rapidly as we advance eastward, through Figeac, Clermont-Ferrand,
Milan, and Padua; and in the last town we find that the intensity has
attained its maximum.  The influence of the southern declivities of the Alps
is not merely t on the general size of their mass, but (much more), in the
opinion of Elie de Beaumont ('Rech. sur les Revol. de la Surface du Globe',
1830, p. 729), on the rocks of melaphyre and serpentine, which have elevated
the chain.  On the declivity of Ararat, which with Caucasus may be said to
lie in the center of gravity of the old continent formed by Europe, Asia,
and Africa, the very exact pendulum experiments of Fedorow give indications,
not of subterranean cavities, but of dense volcanic masses.  (Parrot, 'Reise
zum Ararat', bd. ii., s. 143.)  In the geodesic operations of Carlini and
Plana, in Lombardy, differences ranging from 20" to 47".8 have been found
between direct observations of latitude and the results of these operations.
 (See the instances of Andrate and Mondovi, and those of Milan and Padua, in
the 'Operations Geodes. et Astron. pour la Mesure d'un Arc du Parallele
Moyen', t. ii., p. 347; 'Effemeridi Astron. di Milano', 1842, p. 57.)  The
latitude of Milan, deduced from that of Berne, according to the  , is
45¼degrees 27' 52", while, according to direct astronomical observations,
it is 45 degrees 27' 35".  As the perturbations extend in the plain of
Lombardy to Parma, which is far south of the Po (Plana, 'Operat. Geod.', t.
ii., p. 847), it is probable that there are deflecting causes 'concealed
beneath the soil of the plain itself'.  Struve has made similar experiments
[with corresponding results] in the most level parts of eastern Europe.
(Schumacher, 'Astron. Nachrichten', 1830, No. 164, s. 399.)  Regarding the
influence of dense masses supposed to lie at a small depth, equal to the
mean height of the Alps, see the analytical expressions given by Hossard and
Rozet, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. xviii., 1844, p. 292, and compare them
with Poisson, 'Traite de Mecanique' (2me ed., t. i., p. 482.  The earliest
observations on the influence which different kinds of rocks exercise on the
vibration of the pendulum are those of Thomas Young, in the 'Philos.
Transactions' for 1819, p. 70-96.  In drawing conclusions regarding the
Earth's curvature from the length of the pendulum, we ought not to overlook
the possibility that its crust may have undergone a process of hardening
previously to metallic and dense basaltic masses having penetrated from
great depths, through open clefts, and approached near the surface.

In the astronomical part of the determination of degrees of latitude, mountain chains, or the
denser strata of the Earth, likewise exercise, although in a less degree, an unfavorable influence
on the measurement.

As the form of the Earth exerts a powerful influence on the motions of other cosmical bodies,
and especially on that of its own neighboring satellite, a more perfect knowledge of the motion
of the latter will enable us reciprocally to draw an inference regarding the figure of the
Earth.  Thus, as Laplace ably remarks,*  "An astronomer, without leaving his observatory, may,
by a comparison of lunar theory with true observations, not only be enabled to determine the
form and size of the Earth, but also its distance from the Sun and Moon -- results that otherwise
could only be arrived at by long and arduous expeditions to the most remote parts of both hemispheres."

[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 231.

p 169 The compression which may be inferred from lunar inequalities affords an advantage not
yielded by individual measurements of degrees or experiments with the pendulum, since it gives
a mean amount which is referable to the whole planet.  The comparison of the Earth's compression
with the velocity of rotation shows, further, the increase of density from the strata from
the surface toward the center -- an increase which a comparison of the ratios of the axes of
Jupiter and Saturn with their times of rotation likewise shows to exist in these two large
planets.  Thus the knowledge of the external form of planetary bodies leads us to draw conclusions
regarding their internal character.

The northern and southern hemispheres appear to present nearly the same curvature under equal
degrees of latitude, but, as has already been observed, pendulum experiments and measurements
of degrees yield such different results for individual portions of the Earth's surface that
no regular figure can be given which would reconcile all the results hitherto obtained by this
method.  the true figure of the Earth is to a regular figure as the uneven surfaces of water
in motion are on the even surface of water at rest.

When the Earth had been measured, it still had to be weighed.  The oscillations of the pendulum*
and the plummet have here likewise served to determine the mean density of the Earth, either
in connection with astronomical and geodetic operations, with the view of finding the deflection
of the plummet from a vertical line in the vicinity of a mountain, or by a comparison of the
length of the pendulum in a plain and on the summit of an elevation, or, finally, by the employment
of a torsion balance, which may be considered as a horizontally vibrating pendulum for the
measurement of the relative density of neighbouring strata.

[footnote]  *La Caille's pendulum measurements at the Cape of Good Hope, which have been calculated
with much care by Mathieu (Delambre, 'Hist. de l'Astron. au 18me Siecle', p. 479), give a compression
of 1/284.4th; but, from several comparisons of observations  made in equal latitudes in the
two hemispheres (New Holland and the Malouines (Falkland Islands), compared with Barcelona,
New York, and Dunkirk), there is as yet no reason for supposing that the mean compression of
the southern hemisphere is greater than that of the northern.  (Biot, in the 'Mem. de l'Acad.
des Sciences', t. viii., 1829, p. 39-41.)

Of these three methods* the p 170 last is the most certain, since it is independent of the
difficult determination of the density of the mineral masses of which the spherical segment
of the mountain consists near which the observations are made.

[footnote]  *The three methods of observation give the following results: (1.) by the deflection
of the plumb-line in the proximity of the Shehallien Mountain (Gaelic, Thichallin) in Perthshire,
r.713, as determined by Maskelyne, Hutton, and Playfair (1774-1776 and 1810), according to
a method that had been proposed by Newton; (2.) by pendulum vibrations on mountains, 4.837
(Carlini's observations on Mount Cenis compared with Biot's observations at Bordeaux, 'Effemer.
Astron. di Milano', 1824, p. 184); (3.) by the torsion balance used by Cavendish, with an apparatus
originally devised by Mitchell, 5.48 (according to Hutton's revision of the calculation, 5.32,
and according to that of Eduard Schmidt, 5.52; 'Lehrbuch der Math. Geographie', bd. i., s.
487); by the torsion balance, according to Reich, 5.44.  In the calculation of these experiments
of Professor Reich, which have been made with masterly accuracy, the original mean result was
5.43 (with a probable error of only 0.0233), a result which, being increased by the quantity
by which the Earth's centrifugal force diminishes the force of gravity for the latitude of
Freiberg (50 degrees 55'), becomes changed to 5.44.  The employment of cast iron instead of
lead has not presented any sensible difference, or none exceeding the limits of errors of observation,
hence disclosing no traces of magnetic influences.  (Reich, 'Vrsuche uber die mittlere Dichtigheit
der Erde', 1838, s. 60, 62, and 66.)  By the assumption of too slight a degree of ellipticity
of the Earth, and by the uncertainty of the estimations regarding the density of rocks on its
surface, the mean density of the Earth, as deduced from experiments on and near mountains,
was found about one sixth smaller than it really is, namely, 4.761 (Laplace, 'Mecan. Celeste',
t. v., p. 46), or 4.785.  (Eduard Schmidt, 'Lehrb. der Math. Geogr.', bd. i., 387 und 418.)
On Halley's hypothesis of the Earth being a hollow sphere (noticed in page 171), which was
the germ of Franklin's ideas concerning earthquakes, see 'Philos. Trans.' for the year 1693,
vol. xvii., p. 563 ('On the Structure of the Internal Parts of the Earth, and the concave habited
'Arch of the Shell').  Halley regarded it as more worthy of the Creator "that the Earth, like
a house of several stories, should be inhabited both without and within.  For light in the
hollow sphere (p. 576) provision might in some manner be contrived."

According to the most recent experiments of Reich, the result obtained is 5.44; that is to
say, the mean density of the whole Earth is 5.44 times greater than tht of pure water.  As
according to the nature of the mineralogical strata constituting the dry continental part of
the Earth's surface, the mean density of this portion scarcely amounts to 2.7, and the density
of the dry and liquid surface conjointly to scarcely 1.6, it follows that the elliptical unequally
compressed layers of the interior must greatly increase in density toward the center, either
through pressure or owing to the heterogeneous nature of the substances.  Here again we see
that the vertical, as well as the horizontally vibrating pendulum, may justly be termed a geognostical
instrument.

The results obtained by the employment of an instrument of this kind have
led celebrated physicists, according to the difference of the hypothesis
from which they started, to adopt
p 171
entirely opposite views regarding the nature of the interior of the globe.
It has been computed at what depths liquid or even gaseous substances would,
from the pressure of their own superimposed strata, attain a density
exceeding that of platinum or even iridium; and in order that the
compression which has been detrmined within such narrow limits might be
brought into harmony with the assumption of simple and infinitely
compressible matter, Leslie has ingeniously conceived the nucleus of the
world to be a hollow sphere, filled with an assumed "imponderable matter,
having an enormous force of expansion."  These venturesome and arbitrary
conjectures have given rise, in wholly unscientific circles, to still more
fantastic notions.  The hollow sphere has by degrees been peopled with
plants and animals, and two small subterranean revolving planets -- Pluto
and Proserpine -- were imaginatively supposed to shed over it their mild
light; as, however, it was further imagined that an ever-uniform temperature
reigned in these internal regions, the air, which was made self-luminous by
compression, might well render the planets of this lower world unnecessary.
Near the north pole, at 80 degrees latitude, whence the polar light
emanates, was an enormous opening, through which a descent might be made
into the hollow sphere, and Sir Humphrey Davy and myself were even publicly
and frequently invited by Captain Symmes to enter upon this subterranean
expedition:  so powerful is the morbid inclination of men to fill unknown
spaces with shapes of wonder, totally unmindful of the counter evidence
furnished by well-attested facts and universally acknowledged natural laws.
Even the celebrated Halley, at the end of the seventeenth century, hollowed
out the Earth in his magnetic speculations.  Men were invited to believe
that a subterranean freely-rotating nucleus occasions by its position the
diurnal and annual changes of magnetic declination. Hafniae et Lipsiae sunt.

severe satire on the institutions, morals, and manners of the inhabitants of
the upper Earth, appeared at Copenhagen in 1789, and was entitled 'Niels
Klim's underjordiske reise ocd Ludwig Holberg, oversal after den Latinske
original of Jens Baggesen'.  Holberg, who studied for a time at Oxford, was
born at Bergen in 1685, and died in 1754 as Rector of the University of

p 172 The figure of the Earth and the amount of solidification (density) which it has acquired
are intimately connected with the forces by which it is animated, in so far, at least, as they
have been excited or awakened from without, through its planetry position with reference to
a luminous central body.  Compression, when considered as a consequence of centrifugal force
acting on a rotating mass, explains the earlier condition of fluidity of our planet.  During
the solidification of this fluid, which is commonly conjectured to have been gaseous and primordially
heated to a very high temperature, an enormous quantity of latent heat must have been liberated.
If the process of solidification began as Fourier conjectures, by radiation from the cooling
surface exposed to the atmosphere, the particles near the center would have continued fluid
and hot.  As, after long emanation of heat from the center toward the exterior, a stable condition
of the temperature of the Earth would at length be established, it has been assumed that with
increasing depth the subterranean heat likewise uninterruptedly increases. The heat of the
water which flows from deep borings (Artesian wells), direct experiments regarding the temperature
of rocks in mines, but, above all, the volcanic activity of the Earth, shown by the flow of
molten masses from open fissures, afford unquestionable evidence of this increase for very
considerable depths from the upper strata.  According to conclusions based certainly upon mere
analogies, this increase is probably much greater toward the center.

That which has been learned by an ingenious analytic calculation, expressly perfected for this
class of investigations,* p 173 regarding the motion of heat in homogeneous metallic spheroids,
must be applied with much caution to the actual character of our planet, considering our present
imperfect knowledge of the substances of which the Earth is composed, the difference in the
capacity of heat and in the conducting power of different superimposed masses, and the chemical
changes experienced by solid and liquid masses from any enormous compression.

[footnote]  *Here we must notice the admirable analytical labors of Fourier, Biot, Laplace,
Poisson, Duhamel, and Lame.  In his 'Theorie Mathematique de la Chaleur', 1835, p. 3, 428-430,
436, and 521-524 (see, also, De la Rive's abstract in the 'Bibliotheque Universelle de Geneve',
Poisson has developed an hypothesis totally different from Fourier's view ('Theorie Analytique
de la Chaleur'.)  He denies the present fluid state of the Earth's center; he believes that
"in cooling by radiation to the medium surrounding the Earth, the parts which were first solidified
sunk, and that by a double descending and ascending current, the great inequality was lessened
which would have taken place in a solid body cooling from the surface."  It seems more probable
to this great geometer that the solidification began in the parts lying nearest to the center:
"the phenomenon of the increase of heat with the depth does not extend to the whole mass of
the Earth, and is merely a consequence of the motion of our planetary system in space, of which
some parts are of a very different temperature from others, in consequence of stellar heat
(chaleur stellaire)."  Thus, according to Poisson, the warmth of the water of our Artesian
wells is merely that which has penetrated into the Earth from without; and the Earth itself
"might be regarded as in the same circumstances as a mass of rock conveyed from the equator
to the pole in so short a time as not to have entirely cooled.  The increase of temperature
in such a block would not extend to the central strata."  The physical doubts which have reasonably
been entertained against this extraordinary cosmical view (which attributes to the regions
of space that which probably is more dependent on the first transition of matter condensing
from the gaseo-fluid into the solid state) will be found collected in Poggendorf's 'Annalen',
bd. xxxix., s 93-100.

It is with the greatest difficulty that our powers of comprehension can conceive the boundary
line which divides the fluid mass of the interior from the hardened mineral masses of the external
surface, or the gradual increase of the solid strata, and the condition of semi-fluidity of
the earthy substances, these being conditions to which known laws of hydraulics can only apply
under considerable modifications.  The Sun and Moon, which cause the sea to ebb and flow, most
probably also affect these subterranean depths.  We may suppose that the periodic elevations
and depressions of the molten mass under the already solidified strata must have caused inequalities
in the vaulted surface from the force of pressure.  The amount and action of such oscillations
must, however, be small; and if the relative position of the attracting cosmical bodies may
here also excite "spring tides," it is certainly not to these, but to more powerful internal
forces, that we must ascribe the movements that shake the Earth's surface.  There are groups
of phenomena to whose existence it is necessary to draw attention, in order to indicate the
universality of the influence of the attraction of the Sun and Moon on the external and internal
conditions of the Earth, however little we may be able to determine the quantity of this influence.

According to tolerably accordant experiments in Artesian wells, it has been shown that the
heat increases on an average about 1 degree for every 54.5 feet.  If this increase can be reduced
p 174 to arithmetical relations, it will follow, as I have already observed,* that a stratum
of granite would be in a state of fusion at a depth of nearly twenty-one geographical miles,
or between four and five times the elevation of the highest summit of the Hinalaya.

[footnote]  *See the Introduction.  This increase of temperature has been found in the Puits
de Grenelle, at Paris, at 58.3 feet; in the boring at the new salt-works at Minden, almost
53.6; at Pregny, near Geneva, according to Auguste de la Rive and Marcet, notwithstanding that
the mouth of the boring is 1609 feet above the level of the sea, it is also 53.6 feet.  This
coincidence between the results of a method first proposed by Arago in the year 1821 ('Annuaire
du Bureau des Longitudes', 1835, p. 234), for three different mines, of the absolute depths
of 1794, 2231, and 725 feet respectively, is remarkable.  The two points on the Earth, lying
at a small vertical distance from each other, whose annual mean temperatures are most accurately
known, are probably at the spot on which the Paris Observatory stands, and the Caves de l'Observatoire
beneath it; the mean temperature of the former is 51.5¼degrees, and of the latter 53.3¼degrees,
the difference being 1.8¼degrees for 92 feet, or 1 degree for 51.77 feet.  (Poisson, 'Theorie
Math. de la Chaleur', p. 415 and 462.)  In the course of the last seventeen years, from causes
not yet perfectly understood, but probably not connected with the actual temperature of the
caves, the thermometer standing there has risen very nearly 0.4 degrees.  Although in Artesian
wells there are sometimes slight errors from the lateral permeation of water, these errors
are less injurious to the accuracy of conclusions than those resulting from currents of cold
air, which are almost always present in mines.  The general result of Reich's great work on
the temperature of the mines in the Saxony mining districts gives a somewhat slower increase
of the terrestrial heat, or 1 degree to 76.3 feet.  (Reich, 'Beob. uber die Temperatur des
Gesteins in verschielen en Tiefen', 1834, s. 134.)  Phillips, however, found (Pogg., 'Annalen',
bd. xxxiv., s. 191), in a shaft of the coal-mine of Monk-wearmouth, near Newcastle, in which,
as I have already remarked, excavations are going on at a depth of about 1500 feet below the
level of the sea, an increase of 1 degree to 59.06 feet, a result almost identical with that
found by Arago in the Puits de Grenell.

We must distinguish in our globe three different modes for the transmission of heat.  The first
is periodic, and affects the temperature of the terrestrial strata according as the heat penetrates
from above downward or from below upward, being influenced by the different positions of the
Sun and the seasons of the year.  The second is likewise an effect of the Sun, although extremely
slow:  a portion of the heat that has penetrated into the equatorial regions moves in the interior
of the globe toward the poles, where it escapes into the atmosphere and the remoter regions
of space.  The third mode of transmission is the slowest of all, and is derived from the secular
cooling of the globe, and from the small portion of the primitive heat which is still being
disengaged from the surface. p 175 This loss experienced by the central heat must have been
very considerable in the earliest epochs of the Earth's revolutions, but within historical
periods it has hardly been appreciable by our instruments.  The surface of the Earth is therefore
situated between the glowing heat of the inferior strata and the universal regions of space,
whose temperature is probably below the freezing-point of mercury.

The periodic changes of temperature which have been occasioned on the Earth's surface by the
Sun's position and by meteorological processes, are continued in its interior, although to
a very inconsiderable depth.  The slow conducting power of the ground diminishes this loss
of heat in the winter, and is very favorable to deep-rooted trees.  Points that lie at very
different depths on the same vertical line attain the maximum and minimum of the imparted temperature
at very different periods of time.  The further they are removed from the surface, the smaller
is this difference between the extremes.  In the latitudes of our temperate zone (between 48
degrees and 52 degrees), the stratum of invariable temperature is at a depth of from 59 to
64 feet, and at half that depth the oscillations of the thermometer, from the influence of
the seasons, scarcely amount to half a degree.  In tropical climates this invariable stratum
is only one foot below the surface, and this fact has been ingeniously made use of by Boussingault
to obtain a convenient, and as he believes, certain determination of the mean temperature of
the air of different places.*

[footnote]  *Boussingault, 'Sur la Profondeus a laquelle se trouve la Couche de Temperature
invariable, entre les Tropiques', in the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t. liii., 1833,
p. 225-247.

This mean temperature of the air at a fixed point, or at a group of contiguous points on the
surface, is to a certain degree the fundamental element of the climate and agricultural relations
of a district; but the mean temperature of the whole surface is very different from that of
the globe itself.  The questions so often agitated, whether the mean temperature has experienced
any considerable differences in the course of centuries, whether the climate of a country has
deteriorated, and whether the winters have not become milder and the summers cooler, can only
be answered by means of the thermometer; this instrument has, however, scarcely been invented
more than two centuries and a half, and its scientific application hardly dates back 120 years.
The nature and novelty of the means interpose, therefore, very narrow limits to our investigation
regarding the temperature p 176 of the air.  It is quite otherwise, however, with the solution
of the great problem of the internal heat of the whole Earth.  As we may judge of uniformity
of temperature from the unaltered time of vibration of a pendulum, so we may also learn, from
the unaltered rotatory velocity of the Earth, the amount of stability in the mean temperature
of our globe.  This insight into the relations between the 'length of the day' and the 'heat
of the Earth' is the result of one of the most brilliant applications of the knowledge we had
long possessed of the planet.  The rotatory velocity of the Earth depends on its volume; and
since, by the gradual cooling of the mass by radiation, the axis of rotation would become shorter,
the rotatory velocity would necessarily increase, and the length of the day diminish, with
a decrease of the temperature.  From the comparison of the secular inequalities in the motions
of the Moon with the eclipses observed in ancient times, it follows that, since the time of
Hipparchus, that is, for full 2000 years, the length of the day has certainly not diminished
by the hundredth part of a second.  The decrease of the mean heat of the globe during a period
of 2000 years has not, therefore, taking the extremest limits, diminished as much as 1/306th
of a degree of Fahrenheit.*

[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Exp. du Syst. du Monde', p. 229 and 263; 'Mecanique Celeste', t. v.,
p. 18 and 72.  It should be remarked that the fraction 1/306th of a degree of Fahrenheit of
the mercurial thermometer, given in the text as the limit of the stability of the Earth's temperature
since the days of Hipparchus, rests on the assumption that the dilation of the substances of
which the Earth is composed is equal to that of glass, that is to say, 1/18,000th for 1 degree.
Regarding this hypothesis, see Arago in the 'Annuaire' for 1834, p. 177-190.

This invariability of form presupposes also a great invariability in the distribution of relations
of density in the interior of the globe.  The translatory movements, which occasion the eruptions
of our present volcanoes and of ferruginous lava, and the filling up of previously empty fissures
and cavities with dense masses of stone, are consequently only to be regarded as slight superficial
phenomena affecting merely one portion of the Earth's crust, which, from their smallness when
compared to the Earth's radius, become wholly insignificant.

I have described the internal heat of our planet, both with reference to its cause and distribution,
almost solely from the results of Fourier's admirable investigations.  Poisson doubts the fact
of the uninterrupted increase of the Earth's heat p 177 from the surface to the center, and
is of opinion that all heat has penetrated from without inward, and that the temperature of
the globe depends upon the very high or very low temperature of the regions of space through
which the solar temperature of the regions of space, through which the solar system has moved.
This hypothesis, imagined by one of the most acute mathematicians of our time, has not satisfied
physicists or geologists, or scarcely indeed any one besides its author.  But, whatever may
be the cause of the internal heat of our planet, and of its limited or unlimited increase in
deep strata, it leads us, in this general sketch of nature, through the intimate connection
of all primitive phenomena of matter, and through the common bond by which molecular forces
are united, into the mysterious domain of magnetism.  Changes of temperature call forth magnetic
and electric currents.  Terrestrial magnetism, whose main character, expressed in the three-fold
manifestation of its forces, is incessant periodic variability, is ascribed either to the heated
mass of the Earth itself,* or to those galvanic currents which we consider as electricity in
motion, that is, electricity moving in a closed circuit.**

[footnote]  *William Gilbert, of Colchester, whom Galileo pronounced "great to a degree that
might be envied," said "magnus magnes ipse est globus terrestris."  He ridicules the magnetic
mountains of Frascatori, the great contemporary of Columbus, as being magnetic poles:  "rejicienda
est vulgaris opinio de montibus magneticis, aut rupe aliqua magnetica, aut polo phantastico
a polo mundi distante."  He assumes the declination of the magnetic needle at any give point
on the surface of the Earth to be invariable (variatio uniuscujusque loci constans est), and
refers the curvatures of the isogonic lines to the configuration of continents and the relative
positions of sea basins, which possess a weaker magnetic force than the solid masses rising
above the ocean.  (Gilbert, 'de Magnete', ed. 1633, p. 42, 98, 152 and 155.)

[footnote]  ** Gauss, 'Allgemcine Theorie des Erdmagnetismus', in the 'Resultate aux den Beob.
des Magnet. Vereins', 1838, s. 41, p. 56.

The mysterious course of the magnetic needle is equally affected by time and space, by the
sun's course, and by changes of place on the Earth's surface. Between the tropics, the hour
of the day may be known by the direction of the needle as well as by the oscillations of the
barometer.  It is affected instantly, but only transiently, by the distant northern light as
it shoots from the pole, flashing in beams of colored light across the heavens.  When the uniform
horary motion of the needle is disturbed by a magnetic storm, the perturbation manifests itself
'simultaneously', in the strictest sense of the word, over hundreds and thousands of miles
of sea and land, or propagates itself by degrees, in short intervals of time, in p 178 every
direction over the Earth's surface.*

[footnote]  *There are also perturbations which are of a local character, and do not extend
themselves far, and are probably less deep-seated.  Some years ago I described a rare instance
of this kind, in which an extraordinary disturbance was felt in the mines at Freiberg, but
was not perceptible at Berlin.  ('Lettre de M. de Humboldt a Son Altesse Royale le Duc de Sussex
sur les moyens propres a perfectionner la Connaissance du Magnetisme Terrestre', in Becquerel's
'Traite Experimental de l'Electricite' t. vii., p. 442.)  Magnetic storms which were simultaneously
felt from Sicily to Upsala, did not extend from Upsala to Alten.  (Gauss and Weber, 'Resultate
des Magnet. Vereins', 1839, 128; Lloyd, in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences', t.
xii., 1843, Sem. ii., p. 725 and 827.)  Among the numerous examples that have been recently
observed, of perturbations occurring simultaneously and extending over wide portions of the
Earth's surface, and which are collected in Sabine's important work ('Observ. on Days of unusual
Magnetic Disturbance', 1843), one of the most remarkable is that of the 25th of September,
1841, which was observed at Toronto in Canada, at the Cape of Good Hope, at Prague, and partially
in Van Diemen's Land.  The English Sunday, on which it is deemed sinful, after midnight on
Saturday, to register an observation, and to follow out the great phenomena of creation in
their perfect development, interrupted the observations in Van Diemen's Land, where in consequence
of the difference of the longitude, the magnetic storm fell on the Sunday.  ('Observ.', p.
xiv., 78, 85, and 87.)

In the former case, the simultaneous manifestation of the storm may serve, within certain limitations,
like Jupiter's satellites, fire-signals, and well-observed falls of shooting stars, for the
geographical determination of degrees of longitude.  We here recognize with astonishment that
the perturbations of two small magnetic needles, even if suspended at great depths below the
surface, can measure the distances apart at which they are placed, teaching us, for instance,
how far Kasan is situated east of Gottingen or of the banks of the Seine.  There are also districts
in the earth where the mariner, who has been enveloped for many days in mist, without seeing
either the sun or stars, and deprived of all means of determining the time, may know with certainty,
from the variations in the inclination of the magnetic needle, whether he is at the north or
the south of the port he is desirous of entering.*

[footnote]  *I have described, in Lametherie's 'Journal de Physique', 1804, t. lix., p. 449,
the application (alluded to in the text) of the magnetic inclination to the determination of
latitude along a coast running north and south, and which, like that of Chili and Peru, is
for a part of the year enveloped in mist ('garua').  In the locality I have just mentioned,
this application is of the greater importance, because, in consequence of the strong current
running northward as far as to Cape Parena, navigators incur a great loss of time if they approach
the coast to the north of the haven they are seeking.  In the South Sea, from Callao de Lima
harbor to Truxillo, which differ from each other in latitude by 3 degrees 57' I have observed
a variation of the magnetic inclination amounting to 9 degrees (centesimal division); and from
Callao to Guayaquil, which differ in latitude by 9 degrees 50', a variation of 23.5 degrees.
(See my 'Relat.  The determination of position by means of the magnetic inclination has this
remarkable feature connected with it, that where the ship's course cuts the isoclinalline almost
perpendicularly, it is the only one that is independent of all determination of time, and consequently,
of observations of the sun or stars.  It is only lately that I discovered, for the first time,
that as early as at the close of the sixteenth century, and consequently hardly twenty years
after Robert Norman had invented the inclinatorium, William Gilbert, in his great work, 'De
Magnete', proposed to determine the latitude by the inclination of the magnetic needle.  Gilbert
('Physiologia Nova de Magnete', lib. v., cap. 8, p. 200) commends the method as applicable
"are caliginoso."  Edward Wright, in the introduction which he added to his master's great
work, describes this proposal as "worth much gold."  As he fell into the same error with Gilbert,
of presuming that the isoclinal lines coincided with the geographical parallel circles, and
that the magnetic and geographical equators were identical, he did not perceive that the proposed
method had only a local and very limited application.

p 179 When the needle, by its sudden disturbance in its horary course, indicates the presence
of a magnetic storm, we are still unfortunately ignorant whether the seat of the disturbing
cause is to be sought in the Earth itself or in the upper regions of the atmosphere.  If we
regard the Earth as a true magnet, we are obliged, according to the views entertained by Friedrich
Gauss (the acute propounder of a generaltheory of terrestrial magnetism), to ascribe to every
portion of the globe measuring one eighth of a cubic meter (or 3 7/10ths of a French cubic
foot) in volume, an average amount of magnetism equal to that contained in a magnetic rod of
1 lb. weight.*

[footnote[  *Gauss and Weber, 'Resultate des Magnet. Vereins', 1838, 31, s. 146.

If iron and nickel, and probably, also, cobalt (but not chrome, as has long been believed),*
are the only substances which become permanently magnetic, and retain polarity from a certain
coerceive force, the phenomena of Arago's magnetism of rotation and of Faraday's induced currents
show, on the other hand, that all telluric substances may possibly be made transitorily magnetic.

According to Faraday ('London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine', 1836, vol. viii., p. 178),
pure cobalt is totally devoid of magnetic power.  I know, however, that other celebrated chemists
(Heinrich Rose and Wohler) do not admit this as absolutely certain.  If out of two carefully-purified
masses of cobalt totally free from nickel, one appears altogether non-magnetic (in a state
of equilibrium), I think it probable that the other owes its magnetic property to a want of
purity; and this opinion coincides with Faraday's view.

According to the experiments of the p 180 first-mentioned of these great physicists, water,
ice, glass, and carbon affect the vibrations of the needle entirely in the same manner as mercury
in the rotation experiments.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. xxxii., p. 214; Brewster, 'Treaties on Magnetism',
1837, p. 111; Baumgartner, in the 'Zeitschrift fur Phys. und Mathem.', bd. ii., s. 419.

Almost all substances show themselves to be, in a certain degree, magnetic when they are conductors,
that is to say, when a current of electricity is passing through them.

Although the knowledge of the attracting power of native iron magnets or loadstones appears
to be of very ancient date among the nations of the West, there is strong historical evidence
in proof of the striking fact that the knowledge of the directive power of a magnetic needle
and of its relation to terrestrial magnetism was peculiar to the Chinese, a people living in
the extremest eastern portions of Asia.  More than a thousand years before our era, in the
obscure age of Codrus, and about the time of the return of the Heraclidae to the Peloponnesus,
the Chinese had already magnetic carriages, on which the movable arm of the figure of a man
continually pointed to the south, as a guide by which to find the way across the boundless
grass plains of Tartary; nay, even in the third century of our era, therefore at least 700
years before the use of the mariner's compass in European seas, Chinese vessels navigated the
Indian Ocean* under the direction of magnetic needles pointing to the south.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Examen Critique de l'Hist. de la Geographie', t. iii., p. 36.

I have shown, in another work, what advantages this means of topographical direction, and the
early knowledge and application of the magnetic needle gave the Chinese geographers over the
Greeks and Romans, to whom, for instance, even the true direction of the Apennines and Pyrenees
always remained unknown.*

[footnote] *'Asie Centrale', t. i., Introduction, p. xxxviii-xlii.  The Western nations, the
Greeks and the Romans, knew that magnetism could be communicated to iron, 'and that that metal
would retain it for a length of time'.  ("Sola haec materia ferri vires, a maguete lapide accipit,
'retinetque longo tempore."  Plin., xxxiv., 14.)  The great discovery of the terrestrial directive
force depended, therefore, alone on this, that no one in the West had happened to observe an
elongated fragment of magnetic iron stone, or a magnetic iron rod, floating, by the aid of
a piece of wood, in water, or suspended in the air by a thread, in such a position as to admit
of free motion.

The magnetic power of our globe is manifested on the terrestrial surface in three classes of
phenomena, one of which exhibits itself in the varying intensity of the force, and the two
others in the varying direction of the inclination, and in p 181 the horizontal deviation from
the terrestrial meridian of the spot.  Their combined action may therefore be graphically represented
by three systems of lines, the 'isodynamic, isoclinic', and 'isogonic' (or those of equal force,
equal inclination, and equal declination).  The distances apart, and the relative positions
of these moving, oscillating, and advancing curves, do not always remain the same.  The total
deviation (variation or declination of the magnetic needle) has not at all changed, or, at
any rate, not in any appreciable degree, during a whole century, at any particular point on
the Earth's surface,* as, for instance, the western part of the Antilles, or Spitzbergen.

[footnote]  *A very slow secular progression, or a local invariability of the magnetic declination,
prevents the confusion which might arise from terrestrial influences in the boundaries of land,
when, with an utter disregard for the correction of declination, estates are, after long intervals,
measured by the mere application of the compass.  "The whole mass of the bottomless pit of
endless litigation by the invariability of the magnetic declination in Jamica and the surrounding
Archipelago during the whole of the last century, all surveys of property there having been
conducted solely by the compass."  See Robertson in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1806,
Part ii., p. 348, 'On the Permanency of the Compass in Jamaica since 1660'.  In the mother
country (England) the magnetic declination has varied by fully 14 degrees during the period.

In like manner, we observe that the isogonic curves, when they pass in their secular motion
from the surface of the sea to a continent or an island of considerable extent, continue for
a long time in the same position, and become inflected as they advance.

These gradual changes in the forms assumed by the lines in their translatory motions, and which
so unequally modify the amount of eastern and western declination, in the course of time render
it difficult to trace the transitions and analogies of forms in the graphic representations
belonging to different centuries.

Each branch of a curve has its history, but this history does not reach further back among
the nations of the West than the memorable epoch of the 13th of September, 1492, when the re-discoverer
of the New World found a line of no variation 3 degrees west of the meridian of the island
of Flores, one of the Azores.*

[footnote]  *I have elsewhere shown that, from the documents which have come down to us regarding
the voyages of Columbus, we can, with much certainty, fix upon three places 'in the Atlantic
line of no declination' for the 13th of September, 1492, the 21st of May, 1496, and the 16th
of August, 1498. The Atlantic line of no declination at that period ran from northeast to southwest.
It then touched the South American continent a little east of Cape Codera, while it is not
observed to reach that continent on the northern coast of the Brazils.  (Humboldt, 'Examen
Critique de l'Hist. de la Geogr.', t. iii., p. 44-48.)  From Gilbert's 'Physiologia Nova de
Magnete', we see plainly (and the fact is very remarkable) that in 1600 the declination was
still null in the region of the Azores, just as it had been in the time of Columbus (lib. 4,
cap. 1).  I believe that in my 'Examen Critique' (t. iii., p. 54) I have proved from documents
that the celebrated line of demarkation by which Pope Alexander VI. divided the Western hemisphere
between Portugal and Spain was not drawn through the most western point of the Azores, because
Columbus wished to convert a physical into a political division.  He attached great importance
to the zone (raya) "in which the compass shows no variation, where air and ocean, the later
covered with pastures of sea-weed, exhibit a peculiar constitution, where cooling winds begin
to blow, and where [as erroneous observations of the polar star led him to imagine] the form
(sphericity) of the Earth is no longer the same."

The whole of Europe, excepting a small p 182 part of Russia, has now a western declination,
while at the close of the seventeenth century the needle first pointed due north, in London
in 1657, and in Paris in 1669, there being thus a difference of twelve years, notwithstanding
the small distance between these two places.  In Eastern Russia, to the east of the mouth of
the Volga, of Saratow, Nischni-Nowgorod, and Archangel, the easterly declination of Asia is
advancing toward us.  Two admirable observers, Hansteen and Adolphus Erman, have made us acquainted
with the remarkable double curvature of the lines of declination in the vast region of Northern
Asia; these being concave toward the pole between Obdorsk, on the Oby, and Turuchansk, and
convex between the Lake of Baikal and the Gulf of Ochotsk.  In this portion of the earth, in
northern Asia, between the mountains of Werchojansk, Jakutsk, and the northern Korea, the isogonic
lines form a remarkable closed system.  This oval configuration* recurs regularly and over
a great extent of the South Sea, almost as far as the meridian of Pitcairn and the group of
the Marquesas Islands, between 20 degrees north and 45 degrees p 183 south lat.

[footnote]  *To determine whether the two oval systems of isogonic lines, so
singularly included each within itself, will continue to advance for
centuries in the same inclosed form, or will unfold and expand themselves,
is a question of the highest interest in the problem of the physical causes
of terrestrial magnetism.  In the Eastern Asiatic nodes the declination
increases from without inward, while in the node or oval system of the South
Sea the opposite holds good; in fact, at the present time, in the whole
South Sea to the east of the meridian of Kamt-schatka, there is no line
where the declination is null, or, indeed, in which it is less than 2
degrees (Erman, in Pogg., 'Annal.', bd. xxxi, 129).  Yet Cornelius Schouten,
on Easter Sunday, 1616, appears to have found the declination null somewhere
to the southeast of Nukahiva, in 15 degrees south lat. and 132 degrees west
long., and consequently in the middle of the present closed isogonal system.
 (Hansteen, 'Magnet. der Erde', 1819 ¤ 28.)  It must not be forgotten, in
the midst of all these considerations, that we can only follow the direction
of the magnetic lines in their progress as they are projected upon the
surface of the Earth.

One would almost be inclined to regard this singular configuration of closed, almost concentric,
lines of declination as the effect of a local character of that portion of the globe; but if,
in the course of centuries, these apparently isolated systems should also advance, we must
suppose, as in the case of all great natural forces, that the phenomenon arises from some general
cause.

The horary variations of the declination, which, although dependent upon true time, are apparently
governed by the Sun, as long as it remains above the horizon, diminish in angular value with
the magnetic latitude of place. Near the equator, for instance, in the island of Rawak, they
scarcely amount to three or four minutes, while they are from thirteen to fourteen minutes
in the middle of Europe.  As in the whole northern hemisphere the north point of the needle
moves from east to west on an average from 8 1/2 in the morning until 1 1/2 at mid-day, while
in the southern hemisphere the same north point moves from west to east,* attention has recently
been drawn, with much justice, to the fact that there must be a region of the Earth between
the terrestrial and the magnetic equator where no horary deviations in the declination are
to be observed.

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1836, p. 284, and 1840, p. 330-338.

This fourth curve, which might be called the 'curve of no motion', or, rather, 'the line of
no variation of horary declination', has not yet been discovered.

The term 'magnetic poles' has been applied to those points of the Earth's surface where the
horizontal power disappears, and more importance has been attached to these points than properly
appertains to them;* and in like manner, the curve, where the inclination of the needle is
null, has been termed the 'magnetic equator'.

[footnote]  *Gauss, 'Allg. Theorie des Erdmagnet.', 31.

The position of this line and its secular change of configuration have been made an object
of careful investigation in modern times.  According to the admirable work of Duperrey,* who
crossed the magnetic equator six times between 1822 and 1825, the nodes of the two equators,
that is to say, the two points at which the line without inclination intersects the terrestrial
equator, and consequently passes from one henisphere into the other, are so unequally placed,
that in 1825 the node near the island of St. Thomas, on the western p 184 coast of Africa,
was 188 1/2 degrees distant from the node in the South Sea, close to the little islands of
Gilbert, nearly in the meridian of the Viti group.

[footnote]  *Duperrey, 'De la Configuration de l'Equateur Magnetique', in the 'Annales de Chimie',
t. xlv., p. 371 and 379.  (See also, Morlet, in the 'Memoires presentes par divers Savans a
l'Acad. Roy. des Sciences', t. iii., p. 132.

In the beginning of the present century, at an elevation of 11,936 feet above the level of
the sea, I made an astronomical determination of the point (7 degrees 1' south lat., 48 degrees
40' west long. from Paris), where, in the interior of the New Continent, the chain of the Andes
is intersected by the magnetic equator between Quito and Lima.  To the west of this point,
the magnetic equator continues to traverse the South Sea in the southern hemisphere, at the
same time slowly drawing near the terrestrial equator.  It first passes into the northern hemisphere
a little before it approaches the Indian Archipelago, just touches the southern points of Asia,
and enters the African continent to the west of Socotora, almost in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb,
where it is most distant from the terrestrial equator.  After intersecting the unknown regions
of the interior of Africa in a southwest direction, the magnetic equator re-enters the south
tropical zone in the Gulf of Guinea, and retreats so far from the terrestrial equator that
it touches the Brazilian coast near Os Ilheos, north of Porto Seguro, in 15 degrees south lat.
From thence to the elevated plateaux of the Cordilleras, between the silver mines of micuipampa
and Caxamarca, the ancient seat of the Incas, where I observed the inclination, the line traverses
the whole of South America, which in these latitudes is as much a magnetic 'terra incognita'
as the interior of Africa.

The recent observations of Sabine* have shown that the node near the island of St. Thomas has
moved 4 degrees from east to west between 1825 and 1837.

[footnote]  *See the remarkable chart of isoclinic lines in the Atlantic Ocean for the years
1825 and 1837, in Sabine's 'Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism', 1840, p. 134.

It would be extremely important to know whether the opposite pole, near the
Gilbert Islands, in the South Sea, has aproached the meridian of the
Carolinas in a westerly direction.  These general remarks will be sufficient
to connect the different systems of isoclinic non-parallel lines with the
great phenomenon of equilibrium which is manifested in the magnetic equator.
 It is no small advantage, in the exposition of the laws of terrestrial
magnetism, that the magnetic equator (whose oscillatory change of form and
whose nodal motion exercise an influence on the inclination of the needle in
the remotest districts of the world, in consequence of the altered magnetic
latitudes)* should traverse the
p 185
ocean throughout its whole course, excepting about one fifth, and
consequently be made so much more accessible, owing to the remarkable
relations in space between the sea and land, and to the means of which we
are now possessed for determining with much exactness both the declination
and the inclination at sea.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Ueber die seculre Vernderung der Magnetischen Inclination' (On the
secular Change in the Magnetic Inclination), in Pogg. 'Annal.', bd. sv., s. 322.

We have described the distribution of magnetism on the surface of our planet according to the
two forms of 'declination' and 'inclination'; it now, therefore, remains for us to speak of
the 'intensity of the force' which is graphically expressed by isodynamic curves (or lines
of equal intensity). The investigation and measurement of this force by the oscillations of
a vertical or horizontal needle have only excited a general and lively interest in its telluric
relations since the beginning of the nineteenth century.  The application of delicate optical
and chronometrical instruments has rendered the measurement of this horizontal power susceptible
of a degree of accuracy far surpassing that attained in any other magnetic determinations.
The isogonic lines are the more important in their immediate application to navigation, while
we find from the most recent views that isodynamic lines, especially those which indicate the
horizontal force, are the most valuable elements in the theory of terrestrial magnetism.*

[footnote]  *Gauss, 'Resultate der Beob. des Magn. Vereins', 1838, 21; Sabine, 'Report on the
Variations of the Magnetic Intensity', p. 63.

One of the earliest facts yielded by observation is, that the intensity of the total force
increases from the equator toward the pole.*

[footnote]  *The following is the history of the discovery of the law that the intensity of
the force increases (in general) with the magnetic latitude.  When I was anxious to attach
myself, in 1798, to the expedition of Captain Bandin, who intended to circumnavigate the globe,
I was requested by Borda, who took a warm interest in the success of my project, to examine
the oscillations of a vertical needle in the magnetic meridian in different latitudes in each
hemisphere, in order to determine whether the intensity of the force was the same, or whether
it varied in different places.  During my travels in the tropical regions of America, I paid
much attention to this subject.  I observed that the same needle, which in the space of ten
minutes made 245 oscillations in Paris, 246 in the Havana, and 242 in Mexico, performed only
216 oscillations during the same period at St. Carlos del Rio Negro (1 degree 53' north lat.
and 80 degrees 40' west long. from Paris), on the magnetic equator, i.e., the line in which
the inclination =0; in Peru (7 degrees 1' south lat. and 80 degrees 40' west long. from Paris)
only 211;while at Lima (12 degrees 2' south lat.) the number rose to 219.  I found, in the
years intervening between 1799 and 1803, that the whole force, if we assume it at 1.0000 on
the magnetic equator in the Peruvian Andes, between Micuipampa and Caxamarca, may be expressed
at Paris by 1.3482, in Mexico by 1.3155, in San Carlos del Rio Negro by 1.0480, and in Lima
by 1.0773.  When I developed this law of the variable intensity of terrestrial magnetic force,
and supported it by the numerical value of observations instituted in 104 different places,
in a Memoir read before the Paris Institute on the 26th Frimaire, An. XIII. (of which the mathematical
portion was contributed by M. Biot), the facts were regarded as altogether new.  It was only
after the reading of the paper, as Biot expressly states (Lametherie, 'Journal de Physique',
t. lix., p. 446, note 2) and as I have repeated in 'the Relation Historique', t. i., p. 262,
note 1, that M. de Rossel communicated to Biot his oscillation experiments made six years earlier
(between 1791 and 1794) in Van Diemen's Land, in Java, and in Amboyna.  These experiments gave
evidence of the same law of decreasing force in the Indian Archipelago.  It must, I think be
supposed, that this excellent man, when he wrote his work, was not aware of the regularity
of the augmentation and diminution of the intensity as before the reading of my paper he never
mentioned this (certainly not unimportant) physical law to any of our mutual friends, La Place,
Delambre, Prony, or Biot.  It was not till 1808, four years after my return from America that
the observations made by M. de Rossel were published in the 'Voyage de l'Entrecasteaux', t.
ii., p. 287 , 291, 321, 480, and 644.  Up to the present day it is still usual, in all the
tables of magnetic intensity which have been published in Germany (Hausteen, 'Magnet. der Erde',
1819, s. 71; Gauss, 'Beob. des Magnet. Vereins', 1838, s. 36-39; Erman, 'Physikal. Beob.',
1841, s. 529-579), in England (Sabine, 'Report on Magnet. Intensity', 1838, p. 43-62; 'Contributions
to Terrestrial Magnetism', 1843), and in France (Becquerel, 'Traite de Electr. et de Magnet.',
t. vii., p. 354-367), to reduce the oscillations observed in any part of the Earth to the standard
of force which I found on the magnetic equator in Northern Peru, so that, according to the
unit thus arbitrarily assumed, the intensity of the magnetic force at Paris is put down as
1.348.  The observations made by Lamanon in the unfortunate expedition of La Perouse, during
the stay at Teneriffe (1785), and on the voyage to Macao (1787), are still older than those
of Admiral Rossel.  They were sent to the Academy of Sciences, and it is known that they were
in the possession of Condorcet in the July of 1787 (Becquerel, t. vii., p. 320); but, notwithstanding
the most careful search, they are not now to be found.  From a copy of a very important letter
of Lamanon, now in the possession of Captain Duperrey, which was addressed to the then perpetual
secretary of the Academy of Sciences, but was omitted in the narrative of the 'Voyage de La
Perouse', it is stated "that the attractive force of the magnet is less in the tropics than
when we approach the poles, and that the magnetic intensity deduced from the number of oscillations
of the needle of the inclination-compass varies and increases with the latitude."  If the Academicians,
while they continued to expect the return of the unfortunate La Perouse, had felt themselves
justified, in the course of 1787, in publishing a truth which had been independently discovered
by no less than three different travelers, the theory of terrestrial magnetism would have been
extended by the knowledge of a new class of observations, dating eighteen years earlier than
they now do.  This simple statement of facts may probably justify the observations contained
in the third volume of my 'Relation Historique' p. 615):  "The observations on the variation
of terrestrial magnetism, to which I have devoted myself for thirty-two years, by means of
instruments which admit of comparison with one another, in America, Europe, and Asia, embrace
an area extending over 188 degrees of longitude, from the frontier of Chinese Dzoungarie to
the west of the South Sea bathing the coasts of Mexico and Peru, and reaching from 60 degrees
north lat. to 12 degrees south lat.  I regard the discovery of the law of the decrement of
magnetic force from the pole to the equator as the most important result of my American voyage."
Although not absolutely certain, it is very probable that Condorcet read Lamanon's letter of
July, 1787, at a meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences; and such a simple reading I regard
as a sufficient act of publication.  ('Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes', 1842, p. 463.) 
The first recognition of the law belongs, therefore, beyond all question, to the comparison
of La Perouse; but, long disregarded or forgotten, the knowledge of the law that the intensity
of the magnetic force of the Earth varied with the latitude, did not, I conceive, acquire an
existence in science until the publication of my observations from 1798 to 1804.  The object
and the length of this note will not be indifferent to those who are familiar with the connection
with it, and who, from their own experience, are aware that we are apt to attach some value
to that which has cost us the uninterrupted labor of five years, under the pressure of a tropical
climate, and of perilous mountain expeditions.

p 186 The knowledge which we possess of the quantity of this increase, and of all the numerical
relations of the law of intensity p 187 affecting the whole Earth, is especially due, since
1819, to the unwearied activity of Edward Sabine, who, after having observed the oscillations
of the same needles at the American north pole, in Greenland, at Spitzbergen, and on the coasts
of Guinea and Brazil, has continued to collect and arrange all the facts capable of explaining
the direction of the isodynamic system in zones for a small part of South America.  These lines
are not parallel to lines of equal inclination (isoclinic line), and the intensity of the force
is not at its minimum at the magnetic equator, as has been supposed, nor is it even equal at
all parts of it.  If we compare Erman's observations in the southern part of the Atlantic Ocean,
where a faint zone (0.706) extends from Angola over the island of St. Helena to the Brazilian
coast, with the most recent investigations of the celebrated navigator James Clark Ross, we
shall find that on the surface of our planet the force increases almost in the relation of
1:3 toward the magnetic south pole, where Victoria Land extends from Cape Crozier toward the
volcano Erebus, which has been raised to an elevation of 12,600 feet above the ice.*

[footnote]  *From the observations hitherto collected, it appears that the maximum of intensity
for the whole surface of the Earth is 2.052, and the minimum 0.706.  Both phenomena occur in
the southern hemisphere; the former in 73 degrees 47' S. lat., and 169 degrees 30'E. long.
from Paris, near Mount Crozier, west-northwest of the south magnetic pole, at a place where
Captain James Ross found the inclination of the needle to be 87 degrees 11' (Sabine, 'Contributions
to Terrestrial Magnetism', 1843, No. 5, p. 231); the latter, observed by Erman at 19 degrees
59' S. lat., and 37 degrees 24' W. long. from Paris, 320 miles eastward from the Brazilian
coast of Espiritu Santo (Erman, 'Phys. Beob.', 1841, s. 570), at a point where the inclination
is only 7 degrees 55'.  The actual ratio of the two intensities is therefore as 1 to 2.906.
It was long believed that the greatest intensity of the magnetic force was only two and a half
times as great as the weakest exhibited on the Earth's surface.  (Sabine, 'Report on Magnetic
Intensity', p. 82.)

If the intensity near the magnetic south pole p 188 be expressed by 2.052 (the unit still employed
being the intensity which I discovered on the magnetic equator in Northern Peru), Sabine found
it was only 1.624 at the magnetic north pole near Melville Island (70 degrees 27' north lat.),
while it is 1.803 at New York, in the United States, which has almost the same latitude as Naples.

The brilliant discoveries of Oersted, Arago, and Faraday have established a more intimate connection
between the electric tension of the atmosphere and the magnetic tension of our terrestrial
globe.  While Oestred has discovered that electricity excites magnetism in the neighborhood
of the conducting body, Faraday's experiments have elicited electric currents from the liberated
magnetism.  Magnetism is one of the manifold forms under which electricity reveals itself.
The ancient vague presentiment of the identity of electric and magnetic attraction has been
verified in our own times. "When electrum (amber)," says Pliny, in the spirit of the Ionic
natural philosophy of Thales,* is 'animated' by friction and heat, it will attract bark and
dry leaves precisely as the loadstone attracts iron."

[footnote]  *Of amber (succinum, glessum) Pliny observes (xxxvii., 3), "Genera ejus plura.
Attritu digitorum accepta caloris anima trahunt in se paleas ac folia arida quae levia sunt,
ac ut magnes lapis ferri ramenta quoque."  (Plato, 'in Timaeo', p. 80.  Martin, 'Etude sur
le Timee', t. ii., p. 343-346.  Strabo, xv., p. 703, Casaub,; Clemens Alex., 'Strom.', ii.,
p. 370, where, singularly enough, a difference is made between [Greek words]) When Thales,
in Aristot., 'de Anima', 1, 2, and Hippias, in Diog. Laert., i., 24, describe the magnet and
amber as possessing a soul, they refer only to a moving principle.  These are the words of
Kuopho, a Chinese panegyrist on the magnet, who wrote in the beginning of the fourth century.
(Klaproth, 'Lettre a M. A. de Humboldt, sur l'Invention de la Boussole', 1834, p. 125.)

I observed with astonishment, p 189 on the woody banks of the Orinoco, in the sports of the
natives, that the excitement of electricity by friction was known to these savage races, who
occupy the very lowest place in the scale of humanity.  Children may be seen to rub the dry,
flat, and shining seeds or husks of a trailing plant (probably a 'Negretia') until they are
able to attract threads of cotton and pieces of bamboo cane.  That which thus delights the
naked copper-colored Indian is calculated to awaken in our minds a deep and earnest impression.
What a chasm divides the electric pastime of these savages from the discovery of a metallic
conductor discharging its electric shocks, or a pile composed of many chemically-decomposing
substances, or a light-engendering magnetic apparatus!  In such a chasm lie buried thousands
of years that compost the history of the intellectual development of mankind!

The incessant change or oscillatory motion which we discover in all magnetic phenomena, whether
in those of the inclincation, declination, and intensity of these forces, according to the
hours of the day and the night, and the seasons and the course of the whole year, leads us
to conjecture the existence of very various and partial systems of electric currents on the
surface of the Earth.  Are these currents, as in Seebeck's experiments, thermo-magnetic, and
excited directly from unequal distribution of heat?  or should we not rather regard them as
induced by the position of the Sun and by solar heat?*

[footnote]  *"The phenomena of periodical variations depend manifestly on the action of solar
heat, operating probably through the medium of thermo-electric currents induced on the Earth's
surface.  Beyond this rude guess, however, nothing is as yet known of their physical cause.
It is even still a matter of speculation whether the solar influence be a principal or only
a subordinate cause in the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism." ('Observations to be made in
the Antarctic Expedition', 1840, p. 35.)

Have the rotation of the planets, and the different degrees of velocity which the individual
zones acquire, according to their respective distances from the equator, any influence on the
distribution of magnetism?  Must we seek the seat of these currents, that is to say, of the
disturbed electricity, in the atmosphere, in the regions of planetary space, or in the polarity
of the Sun and Moon?  Galileo, in his celebrated 'Dialogo', was inclined to ascribe the parallel
direction of the axis of the Earth to a magnetic point of attraction seated in universal space.

If we represent to ourselves the interior of the Earth as fused and undergoing an enormous
pressure, and at a degree of temperature the amount of which we are unable to assign, p 190
we must renounce all idea of a magnetic nucleus of the Earth.  All magnetism is certainly not
lost until we arrive at a white heat,* and it is manifested when iron is at a dark red heat,
however different, therefore, the modifications may be which are excited in substances in their
molecular state, and in the coercive force depending upon that condition in experiments of
this nature, there will still remain a considerable thickness of the terrestrial stratum, which
might be assumed to be the seat of magnetic currents.

[footnote]  *Barlow, in the 'Philos. Trans.' for 1822, Pt. i., p. 117; Sir David Brewster,
'Treatise on Magnetism', p. 129.  Long before the times of Gilbert and Hooke, it was taught
in the Chinese work 'Ow-thea-tsou' that heat diminished the directive force of the magnetic
needle.  Moreover, the thermic condition of the surface of water, by which two thirds of our
planet is covered, is not favorable to such modes of explanation, when we have reference to
an immediate action and not to an effect of induction in the arial and aqueous investment
of our terrestrial globe.

In the present condition of our knowledge, it is impossible to afford a satisfactory reply
to all questions regarding the ultimate physical causes of these phenomena.  It is only with
reference to that which presents itself in the triple manifestations of the terrestrial force,
as a measurable relation of space and time, and as a stable element in the midst of change,
that science has recently made such brilliant advances by the aid of the determination of mean
numerical values.  From Toronto in Upper Canada to the Cape of Good Hope and Van Diemen's Land,
from Paris to Pekin, the Earth has been covered, since 1828, with magnetic observatories,*
in which every regular p 191 or irregular manifestation of the terrestrial force is detected
by uninterrupted and simultaneous observations.  A variation p 192 of 1/40000th of the magnetic
intensity is measured, and at certain epochs, observations are made at intervals of 2 1/2 minutes,
and continued for twenty-four hours consecutively.

[footnote]  *As the first demand for the establishment of these observatories (a net-work of
stations, provided with similar instruments) proceeded from me, I did not dare to cherish the
hope that I should live long enough to see the time when both hemispheres should be uniformly
covered with magnetic houses under the associated activity of able physicists and astronomers.
This has, however, been accomplished, and chiefly through the liberal and continued support
of the Russian and British governments.

[footnote continues]  In the years 1806 and 1807, I and my friend and fellow-laborer, Herr
Oltmanns, while at Berlin, observed the movements of the needle, especially at the times of
the solstices and equinoxes, from hour to hour, and often from half hour to half hour, for
five or six days and nights uninterruptedly.  I had persuaded myself that continuous and uninterrupted
observations of several days and nights (observatio perpetua) were preferable to the single
observations of many months.  The apparatus, a Prony's magnetic telescope, suspended in a glass
case by a thread devoid of torsion, allowed angles of seven or eight seconds to be read off
on a finely-divided scale, placed at a proper distance, and lighted at night by lamps.  Magnetic
perturbations (storms), which occasionally recurred at the same hour on several successive
nights, led me even then to desire extremely that similar apparatus should be used to the east
and west of Berlin, in order to distinguish general terrestrial phenomena from those which
are mere local disturbances, depending on the inequality of heat in different parts of the
Earth, or on the cloudiness of the atmosphere.  My departure to Paris, and the long period
of political disturbance that involved the whole of the west of Europe, prevented my wish from
being then accomplished. (OErsted's great discovery (1820) of the intimate connection between
electricity and magnetism again excited a general interest (which had long flagged) in the
periodical variations of the electro-magnetic tension of the Earth.  Arago, who many years
previously had commenced in the Observatory at Paris, with a new and excellent declination
instrument by Gambey, the longest uninterrupted series of horary observations which we possess
in Europe, showed by a comparison with simultaneous observations of perturbation made at Kasan,
what advantages might be obtained from corresponding measurements of declination.  When I returned
to Berlin, after an eighteen years' residence in France, I had a small magnetic house erected
in the autumn of 1828, not only with the view of carrying on the work commenced in 1806, but
more with the object that simultaneous observations at hours previously determined might be
made at Berlin, Paris, and Freiburg, at a depth of 35 fathoms below the surface.  The simultaneous
occurrence of the perturbations, and the parallelism of the movements for October and December,
1829, were then graphically represented.  (Pogg., 'Annalen', bd. xix., s. 357, taf. i.-iii.)
An expedition into Northern Asia, undertaken in 1829, by command of the Emperor of Russia,
soon gave me an opportunity of working out my plan on a larger scale.  The plan was laid before
a select committee of one of the Imperial Academies of Science, and, under the protection of
the Director of the Mining Department, Count von Cancrin, and the excellent superintendence
of Professor Kupffer, magnetic stations were appointed over the whole of Northern Asia, from
Nicolajeff, in the line through Catharinenburg, Barnaul, and Nertschinsk, to Pekin.

[footnote continues]  The year 1832 ('Gottinger gelehrte Anzeigen', st. 206) is distinguished
as the great epoch in which the profound author of a general theory of terrestrial magnetism,
Friedrich Gauss, erected apparatus, constructed on a new principle, in the Gottingen Observatory.
The magnetic observatory was finished in 1834, and in the same year Gauss distributed new instruments,
with instructions for their use, in which the celebrated physicist, Wilhelm Weber, took extreme
interest, over a large portion of Germany and Sweden, and the whole of Italy.  ('Resultate
der Beob. des Magnetischen Verceins in Jahr' 1338, s. 135, and Poggend., 'Annalen.' bd. xxxiii.,
s. 426.)  In the magnetic association that was now formed with Gottingen for its center, simultaneous
observations have been undertaken four times a year since 1836, and continued uninterruptedly
for twenty-four hours.  The periods, however, do not coincide with those of the equinoxes and
solstices, which I had proposed and followed out in 1830.  Up to this period, Great Britain,
in possession of the most extensive commerce and the largest navy in the world, had taken no
part in the movement which since 1828 had begun to yield important results for the more fixed
ground-work of terrestrial magnetism.  In my letter to the Duke of Sussex I urged the establishment
of permanent stations in Canada, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of France, Ceylon,
and New Holland, which five years previously I had advanced as good positions.  The Royal Society
appointed a joint physical and meteorological committee, which not only proposed to the government
the establishment of fixed magnetic observatories in both hemispheres, but also the equipment
of a naval expedition for magnetic observations in the Antarctic Seas.  It is needless to proclaim
the obligations of science to the great activity of Sir John Herschel, Sabine, Airy, and Lloyd,
as well as the powerful support that was afforded by the British Association for the Advancement
of Science at their meeting held at Newcastle in 1838.  In June, 1839, the Antarctic magnetic
expedition, under the command of Captain James Clark Ross, was fully arranged; and now, since
its successful return, we reap the double fruits of the highly important geographical discoveries
around the south pole, and a series of simultaneous observations at eight or ten magnetic stations.

A great English astronomer and physicist has calculated* that the mass of observations which
are in progress will accumulate in the course of three years to 1,958,000.

[footnote]  *See the article on 'Terrestrial Magnetism', in the 'Quarterly Review' 1840, vol.
lxvi., p. 271-312.

Never before has so noble and cheerful a spirit presided over the inquiry into the 'quantitative'
relations of the laws of the phenomena of nature. We are, therefore, justified in hoping that
these laws, when compared with those which govern the atmosphere and the remoter regions of
space, may, by degrees, lead us to a more intimate acquaintance with the genetic conditions
of magnetic phenomena.  As yet we can only boast of having opened a greater number of paths
which may possibly lead to an explanation of this subject. In the physical science of terrestrial
p 193 magnetism, which must not be confounded with the purely mathematical branch of the study,
those persons only will obtain perfect satisfaction who, as in the science of the meteorological
processes of the atmosphere conveniently turn aside the practical bearing of all phenomena
that can not be explained according to their own views.

Terrestrial magnetism, and the electro-dynamic forces computed by the intellectual Ampere,*
stand in simultaneous and intimate connection with the terrestrial or polar light, as well
as with the internal and external heat of our planet, whose magnetic poles may be considered
as the poles of cold.**

[footnote]  *Instead of ascribing the internal heat of the Earth to the transition of matter
from a vapor-like fluid to a solid condition, which accompanies the formation of the planets,
Ampere has propounded the idea, which I regard as highly improbable, that the Earth's temperature
may be the consequence of the continuous chemical action of a nucleus of the metals of the
earths and alkalies on the oxydizing external crust.  "It can not be doubted," he observes
in his masterly 'Theorie des Phenomenes Electro-dynamiques', 1826, p. 199, "that electro-magnetic
currents exist in the interior of the globe, and that these currents are the cause of its temperature.
They arise from the action of a central metallic nucleus, composed of the metals discovered
by Sir Humphrey Davy, acting on the surrounding oxydized layer."

[footnote]  **The remarkable connection between the curvature of the magnetic lines and that
of my isothermal lines was first detected by Sir David Brewster.  See the 'Transactions of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh', vol. ix., 1821, p. 318, and 'Treatise on Magnetism', 1837,
p. 42, 44, 47, and 268.  This distinguished physicist admist two cold poles (poles of maximum
cold) in the northern hemisphere, an American one near Cape Walker (73 degrees lat., 100 degrees
W. long.), and an Asiatic one (73 degrees lat., 80 degrees E. long.); whence arise, according
to him, two hot and two cold meridians, i.e., meridians of greatest heat and cold.  Even in
the sixteenth century, Acosts ('Historia Natural de las Indias', 1589, lib. i., cap. 17), grounding
his opinion on the observations of a very experienced Portuguese pilot, taught that there were
four lines without declination.  It would seem from the controversy of Henry Bond (the author
of 'The Longitude Found', 1676) with Beckborrow, that this view in some measure influenced
Halley in his theory of four magnetic poles.

The bold conjecture hazarded one hundred and twenty-eight years since by Halley,* that the
Aurora Borealis was a magnetic phenomenon, has acquired empirical certainty from Faraday's
brilliant discovery of the evolution of light by magnetic forces.

[footnote]  *Halley, in the 'Philosophical Transactions', vol. xxix. (for 1714-1716), No. 341.

The northern light is preceded by premonitory signs.  Thus, in the morning before the occurrence
of the phenomenon, the irregular horary course of the magnetic needle generally indicates a
disturbance of the equilibrium in the distribution of p 194 terrestrial magnetism.*

[footnote]  *[The Aurora Borealis of October 24th, 1847, which was one of the most brilliant
ever known in this country, was preceded by great magnetic disturbance.  On the 22d of October
the maximum of the west declination was 23 degrees 10'; on the 23d the position of the magnet
was continually changing, and the extreme west declinations were between 22 degrees 44' and
23 degrees 37';on the night between the 23d and 24th of October, the changes of position were
very large and very frequent, the magnet at times moving across the field so rapidly that a
difficulty was experienced in following it.  During the day of the 24th of October there was
a constant change of position, but after midnight, when the Aurora began perceptibly to decline
in brightness, the disturbance entirely ceased.  The changes of position of the horizontal-force
magnet were as large and as frequent as those of the declination magnet, but the vertical-force
magnet was at no time so much affected as the other two instruments.  See 'On the Aurora Borealis,
as it was seen on Sunday evening, October 24th, 1847, at Blackheath,' by James Glaisher, Esq.,
of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in the 'London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philos. Mag and
Journal of Science for Nov.', 1847, by John H. Morgan, Esq.  We must not omit to mention that
magnetic disturbance is now registered by a 'photographic' process:  the self-registering photographic
apparatus used for this purpose in the Observatory at Greenwich was designed by Mr. Brooke,
and another ingenious instrument of this kind has been invented by Mr. F. Ronalds, of the Richmond
Observatory.] -- Tr.

When this disturbance attains a great degree of intensity, the equilibrium of the distribution
is restored by a discharge attended by a development of light "The Aurora* itself is, therefore,
not to be regarded as an externally manifested cause of this disturbance, but rather as a result
of telluric activity, manifested on the one side by the appearance of the light, and on the
other by the vibrations of the magnetic needle."

[footnote]  *Dove, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xx., s. 341; bd. xix., s. 388.  "The declination
needle acts in very nearly the same way as an atmospheric electrometer, whose divergence in
like manner shows the increased tension of the electricity before this has become so great
as to yield a spark."  See also, the excellent observations of Professor Kwmtz, in his 'Lehrbuch
der Meteorologie', bd. iii., s. 511-519, and Sir David Brewster, in his 'Treatise on Magnetism',
p. 280.  Regarding the magnetic properties of the galvanic flame, or luminous arch from a Bunsen's
carbon and zinc battery, see Casselmann's 'Beobachtungen' (Marburg, 1844), s. 56-62.

The splendid appearance of colored polar light is the act of discharge, the termination of
a magnetic storm, as in an electrical storm a development of light -- the flash of lightning
-- indicates the restoration of the disturbed equilibrium in the distribution of the electricity.
An electric storm is generally confined to a small space beyond the limits of which the condition
of the atmospheric electricity remains unchanged.  A magnetic storm, on the other hand, p 193
shows its influence on the course of the needle over large portions of continents, and, as
Arago first discovered far from the spot where the evolution of light was visible.  It is not
improbable that, as heavily-charged threatening clouds, owing to frequent transitions of the
atmospheric electricity to an opposite condition, are not always discharged, accompanied by
lightning, so likewise magnetic storms may occasion far-extending disturbances in the horary
course of the needle, without there being any positive necessity that the equilibrium of the
distribution should be restored by explosion, or by the passage of luminous effusions from
one of the poles to the equator, or from pole to pole.

In collecting all the individual features of the phenomenon in one general picture, we must
not omit to describe the origin and course of a perfectly developed Aurora Borealis.  Low down
in the distant horizon, about the part of the heavens which is intersected by the magnetic
meridian, the sky which was previously clear is at once overcast.  A dense wall of bank of
cloud seems to rise gradually higher and higher, until it attains an elevation of 8 or 10 degrees.
The color of the dark segment passes into  brown or violet; and stars are visible through the
cloudy stratum, as when a dense smoke darkens the sky.  A broad, brightly-luminous arch, first
white, then yellow, encircles the dark segment; but as the brilliant arch appears subsequently
to the smoky gray segment, we can not agree with Argelander in ascribing the latter to the
effect of mere contrast with the bright luminous margin.*

[footnote]  *Argelander, in the important observations on the northern light embodied in the
'Vortrgen gehalten in der physikalish-okonomischen Gessellschaft zu Konigsberg', bd. i., 1834,
s. 257-264.

The highest point of the arch of light is, according to accurate observations made on the subject,*
not generally in the magnetic meridian itself, but from 5 degrees to 18 degrees toward the
direction of the magnetic declination of the place.**

[footnote]  *For an account of the results of the observations of Lottin, Bravais, and Siljerstrom,
who spent a winter at Bosekop, on the coast of Lapland (70 degrees N. lat.), and in 210 nights
saw the northern lights 160 times, see the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. x.,
p. 289, and Martins's 'Meteorologie', 1843, p. 453.  See also, Argelander in the 'Vortragen
geh. in der Konigsberg Gessellschaft', bd. i., s. 259.

[footnote]  **[Professor Challis of Cambridge, states that in the Aurora of
October 24th, 1847, the streamers all converged toward a single point of the
heavens, situated in or very near a vertical circle passing through the
magnetic pole.  Around this point a corona was formed, the rays of which
diverged in all directions from the center, leaving a space free from light:
 its azimuth was 18 degrees 41' from south to east, and its altitude 69
degrees 54'.  See Professor Challis, in the 'Athenaeum', Oct. 31, 1847.] --
Tr.

In the northern latitudes, p 196 in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic pole, the smoke-like
conical segment appears less dark, and sometimes is not even seen.  Where the horizontal force
is the weakest, the middle of the luminous arch deviates the most from the magnetic meridian.

The luminous arch remains sometimes for hours together flashing and kindling in ever-varying
undulations, before rays and streamers emanate from it, and shoot up to the zenith.  The more
intense the discharges of the northern light, the more bright is the play of colors, through
all the varying gradations from violet and bluish white to green and crimson.  Even in ordinary
electricity excited by friction, the sparks are only colored in cases where the explosion is
very violent after great tension.  The magnetic columns of flame rise eithr singly from the
luminous arch, blended with black rays similar to thick smoke, or simultaneously in many opposite
points of the horizon, uniting together to torm a flickering sea of flame, whose brilliant
beauty admits of no adequate description, as the luminous waves are every moment assuming new
and varying forms.  The intensity of this light is at times so great, that Lowenorn (on the
29th of June, 1786) recognized the coruscation of the polar light n bright sunshine.  Motion
renders the phenomenon more visible.  Round the point in the vault of heaven which corresponds
to the direction of the inclination of the needle, the beams unite together to form the so-called
corona, the crown of the northern light, which encircles the summit of the heavenly canopy
with a milder radiance and unflickering emanations of light.  It is only in rare instances
that a perfect crown or circle is formed, but on its completion the phenomenon has invariably
reached its maximum, and the radiations become less frequent, shorter, and more colorless.
The crown and the luminous arches break up, and the whole vault of heaven becomes covered with
irregularly-scattered, broad, faint, almost ashy-gray luminous immovable patches, which in
their turn disappear, leaving nothing but a trace of the dark, smoke-like segment on the horizon.
There often remains nothing of the whole spectacle but a white, delicate cloud with feathery
edges, or divided at equal distances into small roundish groups like cirio-cumuli.

This connection of the polar light with the most delicate cirrous clouds deserves special attention,
because it shows that the electro-magnetic evolution of light is a part of a meteorological
process.  Terrestrial magnetism here manifests its influence p 197 on the atmosphere and on
the condensation of aqueous vapor.  The fleecy clouds seen in Iceland by Thienemann, and which
he considered to be the northern light, have been seen in recent times by Franklin and Richardson
near the American north pole, and by Admiral Wrangel on the Siberian coast of the Polar Sea.
All remarked "that the Aurora flashed forth in the most vivid beams when masses of cirrous
strata were hovering in the upper regions of the air, and when these were so thin that their
presence could only be recognized by the formation of a halo round the moon."  These clouds
sometimes range themselves, even by day in a similar manner to the beams of the Aurora, and
then disturb the course of the magnetic needle in the same manner as the latter.  On the morning
after every distinct nocturnal Aurora, the same superimposed strata of clouds have still been
observed that had previously been luminous.*

Years 1819-1822', p. 552 and 597; Thienemann in the 'Edinburgh Philosophical Journal', vol.
xx., p. 336; Farquharson, in vol. vi., p. 392, of the same journal; Wrangel, 'Phys. Beob.',
s. 59.  Parry even saw the great arch of the northern light continue throughout the day. ('Journal
of the Royal Institution of Great Britain', 1828, Jan., p. 429.)

The apparently converging polar zones (streaks of clouds in the direction of the magnetic meridian),
which constantly occupied my attention during my journeys on the elevated plateaux of Mexico
and in Northern Asia, belong probably to the same group of ciurnal phenomena.*

[footnote]  *On my return from my American travels, I described the delicate
cirro-cumulus cloud, which appears uniformly divided, as if by the action of
repulsive forces, under the name of polar bands ('bandes polaires'), because
their perspective point of convergence is mostly at first in the magnetic
pole, so that the parallel rows of fleecy clouds follow the magnetic
meridian.  One peculiarity of this mysterious phenomenon is the oscillation,
or occasionally the gradually progressive motion, of the point of
convergence.  It is usually observed that the bands are only fully developed
in one region of the heavens, and they are seen to move first from south to
north, and then gradually from east to west.  I could not trace any
connection between the advancing motion of the bands and alterations of the
currents of air in the higher regions of the atmosphere.  They occur when
the air is extremely calm and the heavens are quite serene, and are much
more common under the tropics than in the temperate and frigid zones.  I
have seen this phenomenon on the Andes, almost under the equator, at an
elevation of 15,920 feet, and in Northern Asia, in the plains of
Krasnojarski, south of Buchtarminsk, so similarly developed, that we must
regard the influences producing it as very widely distributed, and as
depending on general natural forces.  See the important observations of
Kamtz ('Vorlesungen uber Meteorologie', 1840, s. 146), and the more recent
ones of Martins and Bravais ('Meteorologie', 1843, p. 117).  In south polar
bands, composed of very delicate clouds, observed by Arqago at Paris on the
23d of June, 1844, dark rays shot upward from an arch running east and west.
 We have already made mention of black rays, resembling dark smoke, as
occurring in brilliant nocturnal northern lights.

p 198 Southern lights have often been seen in England by the intelligent and indefatigable
observer Dalton and northern lights have been observed in the southern hemisphere as far as
45 degrees latitude (as on the 14th of January, 1831).  On occasions that are by no means of
rare occurrence, the equilibrium at both poles has been simultaneously disturbed.  I have discovered
with certainty that northern polar lights have been seen within the tropics in Mexico and Peru.
We must distinguish between the sphere of simultaneous visibility of the phenomenon and the
zones of the Earth where it is seen almost nightly.  Every observer no doubt sees a separate
Aurora of his own, as he sees a separate rainbow.  A great portion of the Earth simultaneously
engenders these phenomena of emanations of light.  Many nights may be instanced in which the
phenomenon has been simultaneously observed in England and in Pennsylvania, in Rome and in
Pekin.  When it is stated that Auroras diminish with the decrease of latitude, the latitude
must be understood to be magnetic, and as measured by its distance from the magnetic pole.
In Iceland, in Greenland, Newfoundland, on the shores of the Slave Lake, and at Fort Enterprise
in Northern Canada, these lights appear almost every night at certain seasons of the year,
celebrating with their flashing beams, according to the mode of expression common to the inhabitants
of the Shetland Isles, "a merry dance in heaven."*

[footnote]  *The northrn lights are called by the Shetland Islanders "the merry dancers." 
(Kendal, in the 'Quarterly Journal of Science', new series, vol. iv., p. 395.)

While the Aurora is a phenomenon of rare occurrence in Italy, it is frequently seen in the
latitude of Philadelphia (39 degrees 57'), owing to the southern position of the American nagnetic
pole.  In the districts which are remarkable, in the New Continent and the Siberian coasts,
for the frequent occurrence of this phenomenon, there are special regions or zones of longitude
in which the polar light is particularly bright and brilliant.*

[footnote]  *See Muncke's excellent work in the new edition of Gehler's 'Physik Worterbuch',
bd. vii., i., s 113-268, and especially s. 158.

The existence p 199 of local influences can not, therefore, be denied in these cases.  Wrangel
saw the brilliancy diminish as he left the shores of the Polar Sea, about Mischne-Kolymsk.
The observations made in the North Polar expedition appear to prove that in the immediate vicinity
of the magnetic pole the development of light is not in the least degree more intense or frequent
than at some distance from it.

The knowledge which we at present possess of the altitude of the polar light is based on measurements
which from their nature, the constant oscillation of the phenomenon of light, and the consequent
uncertainty of the angle of parallax, are not deserving of much confidence.  The results obtained,
setting aside the older data, fluctuate between several miles and an elevation of 3000 or 4000
feet; and, in all probability, the northern lights at different times occur at very different
elevations.*

[footnote]  *Farquharson in the 'Edinburgh Philos. Journal', vol. xvi., p. 304; 'Philos. Transact.'
for 1829, p. 113. [The height of the bow of light of the Aurora seen at the Cambridge Observatory,
March 19, 1847, was determined by Professors Challis, of Cambridge, and Chevallier, of Durham,
to be 177 miles above the surface of the Earth.  See the notice of this meteor in 'An Account
of the Aurora Borealis of Oct. 24, 1847', by John H. Morgan, Esq., 1848.] -- Tr.]

The most recent observers are disposed to place the phenomenon in the region of clouds, and
not on the confines of the atmosphere; and they even believe that the rays of the Aurora may
be affected by winds and currents of air, if the phenomenon of light, by which alone the existence
of an electro-magnetic current is appreciable, be actually connected with matrial groups of
vesicles of vapor in motion, or, more correctly speaking, if light penetrate them, passing
from one vesicle to another.  Franklin saw near Great Bear Lake a beaming northern light, the
lower side of which he thought illuminated a stratum of clouds, while, at a distance of only
eighteen geographical miles, Kendal, who was on watch throughout the whole night, and never
lost sight of the sky, perceived no phenomenon of light.  The assertion, so frequently maintained
of late, that the rays of the Aurora have been seen to shoot down to the ground between the
spectator and some neighboring hill, is open to the charge of optical delusion, as in the cases
of strokes of lightning or of the fall of fire-balls.

Whether the magnetic storms, whose local character we have illustrated by such remarkable examples,
share noise as well as light in common with electric storms, is a question p 200 that has become
difficult to answer, since implicit confidence is no longr yielded to the relations of Greenland
whale-fishers and Siberian fox-hunters.  Northern lights appear to have become less noisy since
their occurrences have been more accurately recorded.  Parry, Franklin, and Richardson, near
the north pole; Thienemann in Iceland; Gieseke in Greenland; Lotur, and Bravais, near the North
Cape; Wrangel and Anjou, on the coast of the Polar Sea, have together seen the Aurora thousands
of times, but never heard any sound attending the phenomenon.  If this negative testimony should
not be deemed equivalent to the positive counter-evidence of Hearne on the mouth of the Copper
River and of Henderson in Iceland, it must be remembered that, although Hood heard a noise
as of quickly-moved musket-balls and a slight cracking sound during an Aurora, he also noticed
the same noise on the following day, when there was no northern light to be seen; and it must
not be forgotten that Wrangel and Gieseke were fully convinced that the sound they had heard
was to be ascribed to the contraction of the ice and the crust of the snow on the sudden cooling
of the atmosphere.  The belief in a crackling sound has arisen, not among the people generally,
but rather among learned travelers, because in earlier times the northern light was declared
to be an effect of atmospheric electricity, on account of the luminous manifestation of the
electricity in rarefied space, and the observers found it easy to hear what they wished to
hear.  Recent experiments with very sensitive electrometers have hitherto, contrary to the
expectation generally entertained, yielded only negative results.  The condition of the electricity
in the atmosphere* p 291 is not found to be changed during the most intense Aurora; but, on
the other hand, the three expressions of the power of terrestrial magnetism, declination, inclination
and intensity, are all affected by polar light, so that in the same night, and at different
periods of the magnetic development, the same end of the needle is both attracted and repelled.

[footnote]  *[Mr. James Glaisher, of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in his interesting 'Remarks
on the Weather during the Quarter ending December 31st, 1847', says, "It is a fact well worthy
of notice, that from the beginning of this quarter till the 29th of December, the electricity
of the atmosphere was almost always in a neutral state, so that no signs of electricity were
shown for several days together by any of the electrical instruments."  During this period
there were 'eight' exhibitions of the Aurora Borealis, of which one was the peculiarly bright
display of the Aurora Borealis, of which one was the peculiarly bright display of the meteor
on the 24th of October.  These frequent exhibitions of brilliant Aurorae seem to depend upon
many remarkable meteorological relations, for we find, according to Mr. Glaisher's statement
in the paper to which we have already alluded, that the previous fifty years afford no parallel
season to the closing one of 1847.  The mean temperature of evaporation and of the dew point,
the mean elastic force of vapor, the mean reading of the barometer, and the mean daily range
of the readings of the thermometers in air, were all greater at Greenwich during that season
of 1847 than the average range of many preceding years.] -- Tr.

The assertion made by Parry, on the strength of the data yielded by his observations in the
neighborhood of the magnetic pole at Melville Island, that the Aurora did not disturb, but
rather exercised a calming influence on the magnetic needle, has been satisfactorily refuted
by Parry's own more exact researches,* detailed in his journal, and by the admirable observations
of Richardson, Hood, and Franklin in Northern Canada, and lastly by Bravais and Lottin in Lapland.

[footnote]  *Kamtz, 'Lehrbuch der Meteorologie', bd. iii., s. 498 and 501.

The process of the Aurora is, as has already been observed, the restoration of a disturbed
condition of equilibrium.  The effect on the needle is different according to the degree of
intensity of the explosion.  It was only unappreciable at the gloomy winter station of  Bosekop
when the phenomenon of light was very faint and aptly compared to the flame which rises in
the closed circuit of a voltaic pile between two points of carbon at a considerable distance
apart, or, according to Fizeau, to the flame rising between a silver and a carbon point, and
attracted or repelled by the magnet.  This analogy certainly sets aside the necessity of assuming
the existence of metallic vapors in the atmosphere, which some celebrated physicists have regarded
as the substratum of the northern light.

When we apply the indefinite term 'polar light' to the luminous phenomenon which we ascribe
to a galvanic current, that is to say, to the motion of electricity in a closed circuit, we
merely indicate the local direction in which the evolution of light is most frequently, although
by no means invariably, seen.  This phenomenon derives the greater part of its importance from
the fact that the Earth becomes 'self-luminous', and that as a planet, besides the light which
it receives from the central body, the Sun, it shows itself capable in itself of developing
light.  The intensity of the terrestrial light, or, rather the luminosity which is diffused,
exceeds, in cases of the brightest colored radiation toward the zenith, the light of the Moon
in its first quarter.  Occasionally, as on the 7th of January, 1831, printed characters could
be read without difficulty.  This almost uninterrupted development of light p 202 in the Earth
leads us by analogy to the remarkable process exhibited in Venus.  The portion of this planet
which is not illumined by the Sun often shines with a phosphorescent light of its own.  It
is not improbable that the Moon, Jupiter, and the comets shine with an independent light, besides
the reflected solar light visible through the polariscope.  Without speaking of the problematical
but yet ordinary mode in which the sky is illuminated, when a low cloud may be seen to shine
with an uninterrupted flickering light for many minutes together, we still meet with other
instances of terrestrial development of light in our atmosphere.  In this category we may reckon
the celebrated luminous mists seen in 1783 and 1831; the steady luminous appearance exhibited
without any flickeriing in great clouds observed by Rozier and Beccaria; and lastly, as Arago*
well remarks, the faint diffused light which guides the steps of the traveler in cloudy, starless,
and moonless nights in autumn and winter, even when there is no snow on the ground.

[footnote]  *Arago, on the dry fogs of 1783 and 1831, which illuminated the night, in the 'Annuaire
du Bureau des Longitudes', 1832, p. 246 and 250; and, regarding extraordinary luminous appearances
in clouds without storms, see 'Notices sur la Tonnerre', in the 'Annuaire pour l'an. 1838',
p. 279-285.

As in polar light or the electro-magnetic storm, a current of brilliant and often colored light
streams through the atmosphere in high latitudes, so also in the torrid zones between the tropics,
the ocean simultaneously develops light over a space of many thousand square miles.  Here the
magical effect of light is owing to the forces of organic nature.  Foaming with light, the
eddying waves flash in phosphorescent sparks over the wide expanse of waters, where every scintillation
is the vital manifestation of an invisible animal world.  So varied are the sources of terrestrial
light! Must we still suppose this light to be latent, and combined in vapors, in order to explain
'Moser's images produced at a distance' -- a discovery in which reality has hitherto manifested
itself like a mere phantom of the imagination.

As the internal heat of our planet is connected on the one hand with the generation of electro-magnetic
currents and the process of terrestrial light (a consequence of the magnetic storm), it, on
the other hand, discloses to us the chief source of geognostic phenomena.  We shall consider
these in their connection with and their transition from merely dynamic disturbances, from
the elevation of whole continents and mountain chains to the development and effusion of gaseous
and p 203 liquid fluids, of hot mud, and of those heated and molten earths which become solidified
into crystalline mineral masses.  Modern geognosy, the mineral portion of terrestrial physics,
has made no slight advance in having investigated this connection of phenomena.  This investigation
has led us away from the delusive hypothesis, by which it was customary formerly to endeavor
to explain, individually every expression of force in the terrestrial globe:  it shows us the
connection of the occurrence of heterogeneous substances with that which only appertains to
changes in space (disturbances or elevations), and groups together phenomena which at first
sight appeared most heterogeneous, as thermal springs, effusion of carbonic acid and sulphurous
vapor, innocuous salses (mud eruptions), and the dreadful devastation of volcanic mountains.*

[footnote]  *[See Mantell's 'Wonders of Geology', 1848, vol. i., p. 34, 36, 105; also Lyell's
'Principles of Geology', vol. ii., and Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', 2d ed., 1848, Part ii., ch.
xxxii., xxxiii.] -- Tr.

In a general view of nature, all these phenomena are fused together in one sole idea of the
reaction of the interior of a planet on its external surface.  We thus recognize in the depths
of the earth, and in the increase of temperature with the increase of depth from the surface,
not only the germ of disturbing movements, but also of the gradual elevation of whole continents
(as mountain chains on long fissures), of volcanic eruptions, and of the manifold production
of mountains and mineral masses.  The influence of this reaction of the interior on the exterior
is not, however, limited to inorganic nature alone.  It is highly probable that, in an earlier
world, more powerful emanations of carbonic acid gas, blended with the atmosphere, must have
increased the assimilation of carbon in vegetables, and that an inexhaustible supply of combustible
matter (lignites and carboniferous formations) must have been thus buried in the upper strata
of the earth by the revolutions attending the destruction of vast tracts of forest.  We likewise
perceive that the destiny of mankind is in part dependent on the formation of the external
surface of the earth, the direction of mountain tracts and high lands, and on the distribution
of elevated continents.  It is thus granted to the inquiring mind to pass from link to link
along the chain of phenomena until it reaches the period when, in the solidifying process of
our planet, and in its first transition from the gaseous form to the agglomeration of matter,
that portion of the inner heat of the Earth was developed, which does not belong to the action
of the Sun.  Earthquakes manifest themselves by quick and successive vertical, or horizontal,
or rotatory vibrations.*

[footnote]  *[See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', 2d ed., 1848, p. 509.] -- Tr.

In the very considerable number of earthquakes which I have experienced in
both hemispheres, alike on land and at sea, the two first-named kinds of
motion have often appeared to me to occur simultaneously.  The mine-like
explosiion -- the vertical action from below upward -- was most strikingly
manifested in the overthrow of the town of Riobamba in 1797, when the bodies
of many of the inhabitants were found to have been hurled to Cullea, a hill
several hundred feet in neight, and on the opposite side of the River Lican.
 The propagation is most generally effected by undulations in a linear
direction,* with a velocity of from twenty to twenty-eight miles in a
minute, but partly in circles of commotion or large ellipses, in which the
vibrations are propagated with decreasing intensity from a center toward the
circumference.

[footnote]  *[On the linear direction of earthquakes, see Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', p. 515.] -- Tr.

There are districts exposed to the action of two intersecting circles of commotion.  In Northern
Asia, where the Father of History,* and subsequently Theophylactus Simocatta,** described the
districts of Scythia as free from earthquakes, I have observed the metalliferous portion of
the Altai Mountains under the influence of a two-fold focus of commotion, the Lake of Baikal,
and the volcano of the Celestial Mountain (Thianschan).***

[footnote]  *Herod, iv., 28.  The prostration of the colossal statue of Memnon, which has been
again restored (Letronne, 'La Statue Vocale de Memnon', 1835, p. 25, 26), presents a fact in
opposition to the ancient prejudice that Egypt is free from earthquakes (Pliny, ii., 80); but
the valley of the Nile does lie external to the circle of commotion of Byzantium, the Archipelago,
and Syria (Ideler ad Aristot., 'Meteor.', p. 584).

[footnote]  **Saint-Martin, in the learned notes to Lebeau, 'Hist. du Bas Empire', t. ix., p. 401.

[footnote]  ***Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 110-118.  In regard to the difference
between agitation of the surface and of the strata lying beneath it, see Gay-Lussac, in the
'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t. xxii., p. 429.

When the circles of commotion intersect one another -- when, for instance, an elevated plain
lies between two volcanoes simultaneously in a state of eruption, several wave-systems may
exist together, as in fluids, and not mutually disturb one another.  We may even suppose 'interference'
p 205 to exist here, as in the intersecting waves of sound.  The extent of the propagated waves
of commotion will be increased on the upper surface of the earth, according to the general
law of mechanics, by which, on the transmission of motion in elastic bodies, the stratum lying
free on the one side endeavors to separate itself from the other strata.

Waves of commotion have been investigated by means of the pendulum and the seismometer* with
tolerable accuracy in respect to their direction and total intensity, but by no means with
reference to the internal nature of their alternations and their periodic intumescence.

[footnote]  *[This instrument, in its simplest form, consists merely of a basin filled with
some viscid liquid, which, on the occurrence of a shock of an earthquake of sufficient force
to disturb the equilibrium of the building in which it is placed, is tilted on one side, and
the liquid made to rise in the same direction, thus showing by its height the degree of the
disturbance.  Professor J. Forbes has invented an instrument of this nature, although on a
greatly improved plan.  It consists of a vertical metal rod, having a ball of lead movable
upon it.  It is supported upon a cylindrical steel wire, which may be compressed at pleasure
by means of a screw.  A lateral movement, such as that of an earthquake, which carries forward
the base of the instrument, can only act upon the ball through the medium of the elasticity
of the wire, and the direction of the displacement will be indicated by the plane of vibration
of the pendulum.  A self-registering apparatus is attached to the machine.  See Professor J.
Forbes's account of his invention in 'Edinb. Phil. Trans.', vol. xv., Part i.] -- Tr.

In the city of Quito, which lies at the foot of a still active volcano (the Rucu Pichincha),
and at an elevation of 9540 feet above the level of the sea, which has beautiful cupolas, high
vaulted churches, and massive edifices of several stories, I have often been astonished that
the violence of the nocturnal earthquakes so seldom causes fissures in the walls, while in
the Peruvian plains oscillations apparently much less intense injure low reed cottages.  The
natives, who have experienced many hundred earthquakes, believe that the difference depends
less upon the length or shortness of the waves, and the slowness or rapidity of the horizontal
vibrations.* than on the uniformity of the motion in opposite directions.

[footnote]  *  "Tutissimum est cum vibrat crispante Aedificiorum crepitu; et cum intumescit
assurgens alternoque motu residet, innoxium et cum concurrentia tecta contrario ictu arietant;
quoniam alter motus alteri renititur.  Undantis inclinatio et fluctus more quaedam volutatio
investa est, aut cum in unam partem totus se motus impellitae -- Plin., ii., 82.

The circling rotatory commotions are the most uncommon, but, at the same time, the most dangerous.
Walls were observed to be twisted, but not thrown down; rows of trees turned from their previous
parallel direction; p 206 and fields covered with different kinds of plants found to be displaced
in the great earthquake of Riobamba, in the province of Quito, on the 4th of February, 1797,
and in that of Calabria, between the 5th of February and the 28th of March, 1782.  The phenomenon
of the inversion or displacement of fields and pieces of land, by which one is made to occupy
the place of another, is connected with a translatory motion or penetration of separate terrestrial
strata.  When I made the plan of the ruined town of Riobamba, one particular spot was pointed
out to me, where all the furniture of one house had been found under the ruins of another.
The loose earth had evidently moved like a fluid in currents, which must be assumed to have
been directed first downward, then horizontally, and lastly upward.  It was found necessary
to appeal to the 'Audiencia', or Council of Justice, to decide upon the contentions that arose
regarding the proprietorship of objects that had been removed to a distance of many hundred roises.

In countries where earthquakes are comparatively of much less frequent occurrence (as for instance,
in Southern Europe), a very general belief prevails, although unsupported by the authority
of inductive reasoning,* that a calm, an oppressive p 207 heat and a misty horizon, are always
the forerunners of this phenomenon.

[footnote]  *Even in Italy they have begun to observe that earthquakes are unconnected with
the state of the weather, that is to say, with the appearance of the heavens immediately before
the shock.  The numerical results of Friedrich Hoffmann ('Hinterlassene Werke', bd. ii., 366-376)
exactly correspond with the experience of the Abbate Scina of Palermo.  I have myself several
times observed reddish clouds on the day of an earthquake, and shortly before it on the 4th
of November, 1799, I experienced two sharp shocks at the moment of a loud clap of thunder.
('Relat. Hist.', liv. iv., chap. 10.)  The Turin physicist, Vassalli Eaudi, observed Volta's
electrometer to be strongly agitated during the protracted earthquake of Pignerol, which lasted
from the 2d of April to the 17th of May, 1808; 'Journal de Physique', t. lxvii., p. 291.  But
these indications presented by clouds, by modifications of atmospheric electricity, or by calms,
can not be regarded as 'generally' or 'necessarily' connected with earthquakes, since in Quito,
Peru, and Chili, as well as in Canada and Italy, many earthquakes are observed along with the
purest and clearest skies, and with the freshest land and sea breezes.  But if no meteorological
phenomenon indicates the coming earthquake either on the morning of the shock or a few days
previously, the influence of certain periods of the year (the vernal and autumnal equinoxes),
the commencement of the rainy season in the tropics after long drought, and the change of the
monsoons (according to general belief), can not be overlooked, even though the genetic connection
of meteorological processes with those going on in the interior of our globe is still enveloped
in obscurity.  Numerical inquiries on the distribution of earthquakes throughout the course
of the year, such as those of Von Hoff, Peter Merian, and Friedrich Hoffmann, bear testimony
to their frequency at the periods of equinoxes.  It is singular that Pliny, at the end of his
fanciful theory of earthquakes, names the entire frightful phenomenon a subterranean storm;
not so much in consequence of the rolling sound which frequently accompanies the shock, as
because the elastic forces, concussive by their tension, accumulate in the interior of the
earth when they are absent in the atmosphere!  "Ventos in causa esse non dubium reor.  Neque
enim unquam intemiscunt terre, nisi sopito mari, coeloque adeo tranquillo, ut volatus avium
non pendeant, subtracto omni spiritu qui vehit; nec unquam nisi post ventos conditos, scilicet
in venas et cavernas ejus occulto afflatu.  Neque aliad est in terra tremor, quam in nube toonitruum;
nec hiatus aliud quam cum fulmen erumpit, incluso spiritu luctante et ad libertatem exire nitente."
(Plin., ii., 79.)  The germs of almost every thing that has been observed of imagined on the
causes of earthquakes, up to the present day, may be found in Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.', vi., 4-31.

The fallacy of this popular opinion is not only refuted by my own experience, but likewise
by the observations of all those who have lived many years in districts where, as in Cumana,
Quito, Peru, and Chili, the earth is frequently and violently agitated.  I have felt earthquakes
in clear air and a fresh east wind, as well as in rain and thunder storms.  The regularity
of the horary changes in the declination of the magnetic needle and in the atmospheric pressure
remained undisturbed between the tropics on the days when earthquakes occurred.*

[footnote]  *I have given proof that the course of the horary variations of the barometer is
not affected before or after earthquakes, in my 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 311 and 513.

These facts agree with the observations made by Adolph Erman (in the temperate zone, on the
8th of March, 1829) on the occasion of an earthquake at Irkutsk, near the Lake of Baikal. 
During the violent earthquake of Cumana, on the 4th of November, 1799, I found the declination
and the intensity of the magnetic force alike unchanged, but, to my surprise, the inclination
of the needle was diminished about 48 degrees.*

[footnonte]  *Humboldt, 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 515-517.

There was no ground to suspect an error in the calculation, and yet, in the many other earthquakes
which I have experienced on the elevated plateaux of Quito and Lima, the inclination as well
as the other elements of terrestrial magnetism remained always unchanged.  Although, in general,
the processes at work within the interior of the earth may not be announced by any meteorological
phenomena or any special appearance of the sky, it is, on the contrary, not improbable, as
we shall soon see, that in cases of violent earthquakes some effect may be imparted to the
atmosphere, in consequence of which they can not always act in a purely dynamic manner.

p 208
During the long-continued trembling of the ground in the Piedmontese valleys
of Pelis and Clusson, the greatest changes in the electric tension of the
atmosphere were observed while the sky was cloudless.  The intensity of the
hollow noise which generally accompanies an earthquake does not increase in
the same degree as the force of the oscillations.  I have ascertained with
certainty that the great shock of the earthquake of Riobamba (4th Feb.,
1797) -- one of the most fearful phenomena recorded in the physical history
of our planet -- was not accompanied by any noise whatever.  The tremendous
noise ('el gram ruido') which was heard below the soil of the cities of
Quito and Ibarra, but not at Tacunga and Hambato, nearer the center of the
motion, occurred between eighteen and twenty minutes 'after' the actual
catastrophe.  In the celebrated earthquake of Lima and Callao (28th of
October, 1746), a noise resembling a subterranean thunder-clap was heard at
Truxillo a quarter of an hour after the shock, and unaccompanied by any
trembling of the ground.  In like manner, long after the great earthquake in
New Granada, on the 16th of November, 1827, described by Boussingault,
subterranean detonations were heard in the whole valley of Cauca during
twenty or thirty seconds, unattended by motion.  The nature of the noise
varies also very much, being either rolling, or rustling, or clanking like
chains when moved, or like near thunder, as, for instance, in the city of
Quito; or, lastly, clear and ringing, as if obsidian or some other vitrified
masses were struck in subterranean cavities.  As solid bodies are excellent
conductors of sound, which is propagated in burned clay, for instance, ten
or twelve times quicker than in the air, the subterranean noise may be heard
at a great distance from the place where it has originated.  In Caracas, in
the grassy plains of Calabozo, and on the banks of the Rio Apure, which
falls into the Orinoco, a tremendously loud noise, resembling thunder, was
heard, unaccompanied by an earthquake, over a district of land 9200 square
miles in extent, on the 30th of April, 1812, while at a distance of 632
miles to the north-east, the volcano of St. Vincent, in the small Antilles,
poured forth a copious stream of lava.  With respect to distance, this was
as if an eruption of Vesuvius had been heard in the north of France.  In the
year 1744, on the great eruption of the volcano of Cotopaxi, subterranean
noises, resembling the discharge of cannon, were heard in Honda, on the
Magdalena River.  The crater of Cotopaxi lies not only 18,000 feet higher
than Honda, but these two points are separated by the colossal
p 209
mountain chain of Quito, Pasto, and Popayan, no less than by numerous
valleys and clefts, and they are 436 miles apart.  The sound was certainly
not propagated through the air, but through the earth, and at a great depth.
 During the violent earthquake of New Granada, in February, 1835,
subterranean thunder was heard simultaneously at Popayan, Bogota, Santa
Marta, and Caracas (where it continued for seven hours without any movement
of the ground), in Haiti, Jamaica, and on the Lake of Nicaragua.

These phenomena of sound, when unattended by any perceptible shocks, produce a peculiarly deep
impression even on persons who have lived in countries where the earth has been frequently
exposed to shocks.  A striking and unparalleled instance of uninterrupted subterranean noise,
unaccompanied by any trace of an earthquake, is the phenomenon known in the Mexican elevated
plateaux by the name of the "roaring and the subterranean thunder) ('bramidos y truenos subterraneos')
of Guanaxuato.*

[footnote]  *On the 'bramidos' of Guanaxuato, see my 'Essai Polit. sur la Nouv. Espagne', t.
i., p. 303.  The subterranean noise, unaccompanied with any appreciable shock, in the deep
mines and on the surface (the town of Guanaxuata lies 6830 feet above the level of the sea),
was not heard in the neighboring elevated plains, but only in the mountainous parts of the
Sierra, from the Cuesta de los Aguilares, near Marfil, to the north of Santa Rosa.  There were
individual parts of the Sierra 24-28 miles northwest of Guanaxuata, to the other side of Chichimequillo,
near the boiling spring of San Jose de Comgngillas, to which the waves of sound did not extend.
Extremely stringent measures were adopted by the magistrates of the large mountain towns on
the 14th of January 1784, when the terror produced by these subterranean thunders was at its
height.  "The flight of a wealthy family shall be punished with a fine of 1000 piasters, and
that of a poor family with two months' imprisonment.  The militia shall bring back the fugitives."
One of the most remarkable points about the whole affair is the opinion which the magistrates
(el cabildo) cherished of their own superior knowledge.  In one of their 'proclamas', I find
the expression, "The magistrates, in their wisdom (en su sabiduria), will at once know when
there is actual danger, and will give orders for flight; for the present, let processions be
instituted."  The terror excited by the tremor gave rise to a famine, since it prevented the
importation of corn from the table-lands, where it abounded.  The ancients were also aware
that noises sometimes existed without earthquakes. -- Aristot., 'Meteor.', ii., p. 802; Plin.,
ii., 80.  The singular noise that was heard from March, 1822, to September, 1824, in the Dalmatian
island Meleda (sixteen miles from Ragusa) and on which Partsch has thrown much light, was occasionally
accompanied by shocks.

This celebrated and rich mountain city lies far removed from any active volcano.  The noise
began about midnight on the 9th of January, 1784, and continued for a month.  I have been enabled
to give a circumstantial p 210 description of it from the report of many witnesses, and from
the documents of the municipality, of which I was allowed to make use.  From the 13th to the
16th of January, it seemed to the inhabitants as if heavy clouds lay beneath their feet, from
which issued alternate slow rolliing sounds and short, quick claps of thunder.  The noise abated
as gradually as it had begun.  It was limited to a small space, and was not heard in a basaltic
district at the distance of a few miles.  Almost all the inhabitants, in terror, left the city,
in which large masses of silver ingots were stored; but the most courageous, and those more
accustomed to subterranean thunder, soon returned, in order to drive off the bands of robbers
who had attempted to possess themselves of the treasures of the city.  Neither on the surface
of the earth, nor in mines 1600 feet in depth, was the slightest shock to be perceived.  No
similar noise had ever before been heard on the elevated tableland of Mexico, nor has this
terrific phenomenon since occurred there. Thus clefts are opened or closed in the interior
of the earth, by which waves of sound penetrate to us or are impeded in their propagation.

The activity of an igneous mountain, however terrific and picturesque the spectacle may be
which it presents to our contemplation, is always limited to a very small space.  It is far
otherwise with earthquakes, which although scarcely perceptible to the eye, nevertheless simultaneously
propagate their waves to a distance of many thousand miles.  The great earthquake which destroyed
the city of Lisbon on the 1st of November, 1755, and whose effects were so admirably investigated
by the distinguished philosopher Emmanuel Kant, was felt in the Alps, on the coast of Sweden,
in the Antilles, Antigua, Barbadoes, and Martinique; in the great Canadian Lakes, in Thuringia,
in the flat country of Northern Germany, and in the small inland lakes on the shores of the
Baltic.*

[footnote]  *[It has been computed that the shock of this earthquake pervaded an area of 700,000
miles, or the twelfth part of the circumference of the globe.  This dreadful shock lasted only
five minutes:  it happened about nine o'clock in the morning of the Feast of all Saints, whien
almost the whole population was within the churches, owing to which circumstance no less than
30,000 persons perished by the fall of these edifices.  See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', p. 514-517.]

Remote springs were interrupted in their flow, a phenomenon attending earthquakes which had
been noticed among the ancients by Demetrius the Callatian.  The hot springs of Toplitz dried
up, and returned, inundating every thing around, and having their waters colored with iron
ocher.  In Cadiz p 211 the sea rose to an elevation of sixty-four feet, while in the Antilles,
where the tide usually rises only from twenty-six to twenty-eight inches, it suddenly rose
above twenty feet, the water being of an inky blackness.  It has been computed that on the
1st of November, 1755, a portion of the Earth's surface four times greater than that of Europe,
was simultaneously shaken.  As yet there is no manifestation of force known to us, including
even the murderous inventions of our own race, by which a greater number of people have been
killed in the short space of a few minutes:  sixty thousand were destroyed in Sicily in 1693,
from thirty to forty thousand in the earthquake of Riobamba in 1797, and probably five times
as many in Asia Minor and Syria, under Tiberius and Justinian the elder, about the years 19
and 526.

There are instances in which the earth has been shaken for many successive days in the chain
of the Andes in South America, but I am only acquainted with the following cases in which shocks
that have been felt almost every hour for months together have occurred far from any volcano,
as, for instance, on the eastern declivity of the Alpine chain of Mount Cenis, at Fenestrelles
and Pignerol, from April, 1808; between New Madrid and Little Prairie,* north of Cincinnati
in the United States of America, in December, 1811, as well as through the whole winter of
1812; and in the Pachalik of Aleppo, in the months of August and September, 1822.

of the Lit. and Philos. Soc. of New York', vol. i., p. 281-308.  In the Piedmonese county of

As the mass of the people are seldom able to rise to general views, and are consequently always
disposed to ascribe great phenomena to local telluric and atmospheric processes, wherever the
shaking of the earth is continued for a long time, fears of  the eruption of a new volcano
are awakened.  In some few cases, this apprehension has certainly proved to be well grounded,
as, for instance, in the sudden elevation of volcanic islands, and as we see in the elevation
of the volcano of Jorullo, a mountain elevated 1684 feet above the ancient level of the neighboring
plain, on the 29th of September 1759, after ninety days of earthquake and subterranean thunder.

If we could obtain information regarding the daily condition of all the earth's surface, we
should probably discover that the earth is almost always undergoing shocks at some point of
its superficies, and is continually influenced by the reaction p 212 of the interior on the
exterior.  The frequency and general prevalence of a phenomenon which is probably dependent
on the raised temperature of the deepest molten strata explain its independence of the nature
of the mineral masses in which it manifests itself.  Earthquakes have even been felt in the
loose alluvial strata of Holland, as in the neighborhood of Middleburg and vliessingen on the
23d of February, 1828.  Granite and mica slate are shaken as well as limestone and sandstone,
or as trachyte and amygdaloid.  It is not, therefore, the chemical nature of the constituents,
but rather the mechanical structure of the rocks, which modifies the propagation of the motion,
the wave of commotion.  Where this wave proceeds along a coast, or at the foot and in the direction
of a mountain chain, interruptions at certain points have sometimes been remarked, which manifested
themselves during the course of many centuries.  The undulation advances in the depths below,
but is never felt at the same points on the surface.  The Peruvians* say of these unmoved upper
strata that "they form a bridge."

[footnote]  *In Spanish they say, 'rocas que hacen puente'.  With this phenomenon of non-propagation
through superior strata is connected the remarkable fact that in the beginning of this century
shocks were felt in the deep silver mines at Marienberg, in the Saxony mining district, while
not the slightest trace was perceptible at the surface.  The miners ascended in a state of
alarm.  Conversely, the workmen in the mines of Falun and Persberg felt nothing of the shocks
which in November, 1823, spread dismay among the inhabitants above ground.

As the mountain chains appear to be raised on fissures, the walls of the cavities may perhaps
favor the direction of undulations parallel to them; occasionally, however, the waves of commotion
intersect several chains almost perpenducularly.  Thus we see them simultaneously breaking
through the littoral chain of Venezuela and the Sierra Parime.  In Asia, shocks of earthquakes
have been propagated from Lahore and from the foot of the Himalaya (22d of January, 1832) transversely
across the chain of the Hindoo Chou to Badakschan, the upper Oxus, and even to Bokhara.*

[footnote]  *Sir Alex. Burnes, 'Travels in Bokhara', vol. i., p. 18; and Wathen, 'Mem. on the
Usbek State', in the 'Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal', vol. iii., p. 337.

The circles of commotion unfortunately expand occasionally in consequence of a single and usually
violent earthquake.  It is only since the destruction of Cumana, on the 14th of December, 1797,
that shocks on the southern coast have been felt in the mica slate rocks of the peninsula of
Maniquarez, situated opposite to the chalk hills of the main land.  The advance p 213 from
south to north was very striking in the almost uninterrupted undulations of the soil in the
alluvial valleys of the Mississippi, the Arkansas, and the Ohio, from 1811 to 1813.  It seemed
here as if subterranean obstacles were gradually overcome, and that the way being once opened,
the undulatory movement could be freely propagated.

Although earthquakes appear at first sight to be simply dynamic phenomena of motion, we yet
discover, from well-attested facts, that they are not only able to elevate a whole district
above its ancient level (as for instance, the Ulla Bund, Delta of the Indus, or the coast of
Chili, in November, 1822), but we also find that various substances have been ejected during
the earthquake, as hot water at Catania in 1818; hot steam at New Madrid, in the Valley of
the Mississippi, in 1812; irrespirable gases, 'Mofettes', which injured the flocks grazing
in the chain of the Andes; mud, black smoke, and even flames, at Messina in 1781, and at Cumana
on the 14th of November, 1797.  During the great earthquake of Lisbon, on the 1st of November,
1755, flames and columns of smoke were seen to rise from a newly-formed fissure in the rock
of Alvidras, near the city.  The smoke in this case became more dense as the subterranean noise
increased in intensity.*

[footnote]  * 'Philos. Transaci.', vol. xlix. p. 414.

At the destruction of Riobamba, in the year 1797, when the shocks were not attended by any
outbreak of the neighboring volcano, a singular mass called the 'Moya' was uplifted from the
earth in numerous continuous conical elevations, the whole being composed of carbon, crystals
of augite, and the silicious shields of infusoria.  The eruption of carbonic acid gas from
fissures in the Valley of the Magdalene, during the earthquake of New Granada, on the 16th
of November, 1827, suffocated many snakes, rats, and other animals.  Sudden changes of weather,
as the occurrence of the rainy season in the tropics, at an unusual period of the year, have
sometimes succeeded violent earthquakes in Quito and Peru.  Do gaseous fluids rise from the
interior of the earth, and mix with the atmosphere? or are these meteorological processes the
action of atmospheric electricity disturbed by the earthquake?  In the tropical regions of
America, where sometimes not a drop of rain falls for ten months together, the natives consider
the repeated shocks of earthquakes, which do not endanger the low reed huts, as auspicious
harbingers of fruitfulness and abundant rain.

p 214 The intimate connection of the phenomena which we have considered is still hidden in
obscurity.  Elastic fluids are doublessly the cause of the slight and perfectly harmless trembling
of the earth's surface, which has often continued several days (as in 1816, at Scaccia, in
Sicily, before the volcanic elevation of the island of Julia), as well as of the terrific explosions
accompanied by loud noise.  The focus of this destructive agent, the seat of the moving force,
lies far below the earth's surface; but we know as little of the extent of this depth as we
know of the chemical nature of these vapors that are so highly compressed.  At the edges of
two craters, Vesuvius, and the towering rock which projects beyond the great abyss of Pichincha,
near Quito, I have felt periodic and very regular shocks of earthquakes, on each occasion from
20 to 30 seconds before the burning scoriae or gases were erupted.  The intensity of the shocks
was increased in proportion to the time intervening between them, and, consequently, to the
length of time in which the vapors were accumulating.  This simple fact, which has been attested
by the evidence of so many travelers, furnishes us with a general solution of the phenomenon,
in showing that active volcanoes are to be considered as safety-valves for the immediate neighborhood.
The danger of earthquakes increases when the openings of the volcano are closed, and deprived
of free communication with the atmosphere; but the destruction of Lisbon, of Caraccas, of Lima,
of Cashmir in 1554,* and of so many cities of Calabria, Syria, and Asia Minor, shows us, on
the whole, that the force of the shock is not the greatest in the neighborhood of active volcanoes.

[footnote]  *On the frequency of earthquakes in Cashmir, see Troyer's German translation of
the ancient 'Radjataringini', vol. ii., p. 297, and Carl Hugel, 'Reisen', bd. ii., s. 184.

As the impeded activity of the volcano acts upon the shocks of the earth's surface, so do the
latter react on the volcanic phenomena.  Openings of fissures favor the rising of cones of
eruption, and the processes which take place in these cones, by forming a free communication
with the atmosphere. A column of smoke, which had been observed to rise for months together
from the volcano of Pasto, in South America, suddenly disappeared, when on the 4th of February,
1797, the province of Quito, situated at a distance of 192 miles to the south, suffered from
the great earthquake of Riobamba.  After the earth had continued to tremble for some time through
out the whole of Syria, in the Cyclades, and in Euboea, the shocks suddenly ceased on the eruption
of a stream of hot mud p 215 on the Lelantine plains near Chalcia.*

[footnote]  * Strabo, lib. i., p. 100, Casaub.  That the expression [Greek words] does not
mean erupted mud, but lava, is obvious from a passage in Strabo, lib. vi., p. 412.  Compare
Walter, in his 'Abnahme der Vulkanischen Thatigkeit in Historischen Zeiten' (On the Decrease
of Volcanic Activity during Historical Times), 1844, s. 25.

The intelligent geographer of Amasea, to whom we are indebted for the notice of this circumstance,
further remarks:  "Since the craters of Aetna have been opened, which yield a passage to the
escape of fire, and since burning masses and water have been ejected, the country near the
sea-shore has not been so much shaken as at the time previous to the separation of Sicily from
Lower Italy, when all communications with the external surface were closed."

We thus recognize in earthquakes the existence of a volcanic force, which, although every where
manifested, and as generally diffused as the internal heat of our planet, attains but rarely,
and then only at separate points, sufficient intensity to exhibit the phenomenon of eruptions.
The formation of veins, that is to say, the filling up of fissures with crystalline masses
bursting forth from the interior (as basalt, melaphyre, and greenstone), gradually disturbs
the free intercommunication of elastic vapors.  This tension acts in three different ways,
either in causing disruptions, or sudden and retroversed elevations, or, finally, as was first
observed in a great part of Sweden, in producing changes in the relative level of the sea and
land, which, although continuous, are only appreciable at intervals of long period.

Before we leave the important phenomena which we have considered not so much in their individual
characteristics as in their general physical and geognostical relations, I would advert to
the deep and peculiar impression left on the mind by the first earthquake which we experience,
eeven where it is not attended by any subterranean noise.*

[footnote]  *[Dr. Tschudi, in his interesting work, 'Travels in Peru', translated from the
German by Thomasina Ross, p. 170, 1847, describes strikingly the effect of an earthquake upon
the native and upon the stranger.  "No familiarity with the phenomenon can blunt this feeling.
The inhabitant of Lima, who from childhood has frequently witnessed these convulsions of nature,
is roused from his sleep by the shock, and rushes from his apartment with the cry of 'Misericordia!'
The foreigner from the north of Europe, who knows nothing of earthquakes but by description,
waits with impatience to feel the movement of the earth, and longs to hear with his own ear
the subterranean sounds which he has hitherto considered fabulous.  With levity he treats the
apprehension of a coming convulsion, and laughs at the fears of the natives:  but, as soon
as his wish is gratified, he is terror-stricken, and is involuntarily prompted to seek safety
in flight."] -- Tr.

This impression is not, p 216 in my opinion, the result of a recollection of those fearful
pictures of devastation presented to our imaginations by the historical narratives of the past,
but is rather due to the sudden revelation of the delusive nature of the inherent faith by
which we had clung to a belief in the immobility of the solid parts of the earth.  We are accustomed
from early childhood to draw a contrast between the mobility of water and the immobility of
the soil on which we tread; and this feeling is confirmed by the evidence of our senses.  When,
therefore, we suddenly feel the ground move beneath us, a mysterious and natural force, with
which we are previously unacquainted, is revealed to us as an active disturbance of stability.
A moment destroys the illusion of a whole life; our deceptive faith in the repose of nature
vanishes, and we feel transported, as it were, into a realm of unknown destructive forces.
Every sound -- the faintest motion in the air -- arrests our attention, and we no longer trust
the ground on which we stand. Animals, especially dogs and swine, participate in the same anxious
disquietude; and even the crocodiles of the Orinoco, which are at other times as dumb as our
little lizards, leave the trembling bed of the river, and run with loud cries into the adjacent
forests.

To man the earthquake conveys an idea of some universal and unlimited danger.  We may flee
from the crater of a volcano in active eruption, or from the dwelling whose destruction is
threatened by the approach of the lava stream; but in an earthquake, direct our flight whithersoever
we will, we still feel as if we trod upon the very focus of destruction.  This condition of
the mind is not of long duration, although it takes its origin in the deepest recesses of our
nature; and when a series of faint shocks succeed one another, the inhabitants of the country
soon lose every trace of fear.  On the coasts of Peru, where rain and hail are unknown, no
less than the rolling thunder and the flashing lightning, these luminous explosions of the
atmosphere are replaced by the subterranean noises which accompany earthquakes.*

[footnote]  *["Along the whole coast of Peru the atmosphere is almost uniformly in a state
of repose.  It is not illuminated by the lightning's flash, or disturbed by the roar of the
thunder; no deluges of rain, no fierce hurricanes, destroy the fruits of the fields, and with
them the hopes of the husbandman.  But the mildness of the elements above ground is frightfully
counterbalanced by their subterranean fury.  Lima is frequently visited by earthquakes, and
several times the city has been reduced to a mass of ruins.  At an average, forty-five shocks
may be counted on in the year.  Most of them occur in the later part of October, in November,
December, January, May, and June.  Experience gives reason to expect the visitation of two
desolating earthquakes in a century.  The period between the two is from forty to sixty years.
The most considerable catastrophes experienced in Lima since Europeans have visited the west
coast of South America happened in the years 1586, 1630, 1687, 1713, 1746, 1806.  There is
reason to fear that in the course of a few years this city may be the prey of another such
visitation."] --Tr.

Long habit, and the very p 217 prevalent opinion that dangerous shocks are only to be apprehended
two or three times in the course of a century, cause faint oscillations of the soil to be regarded
in Lima with scarcely more attention than a hail storm in the temperate zone.

Having thus taken a general view of the activity -- the inner life, as it were -- of the Earth,
in respect to its internal heat, its electro-magnetic tension, its emanation of light at the
poles, and its irregularly-recurring phenomena of motion, we will now proceed to the consideration
of the material products, the chemical changes in the earth's surface, and the composition
of the atmosphere, which are all dependent on planetary vital activity.  We see issue from
the ground steam and gaseous carbonic acid, almost always free from the admixture of nitrogen;*
carbureted hydrogen gas, which has been used in the Chinese province Sse-tschuan** for several
thousand years, and recently in the village of Fredonia, in the State of New York, United States,
in cooking and for illumination; sulphureted hydrogen gas and sulphurous vapors; and, more
rarely,*** sulphurous and hydrochloric acids.****

gas (in bamboo canes) in the city of Khiung-tsheu, see Klaproth, in my 'Asie Centrale', t.
iii., p. 519-530.

[footnote]  *** Boussingault ('Annales de Chimie', t. lii., p. 181) observed no evolution of
hydrochloric acid from the volcanoes of New Granada, while Monticelli found it in enormous
quantity in the eruption of Vesuvius in 1813.

[footnote]  ****[Of the gaseous compounds of sulphur, one, sulphurous acid, appears to predominate
chiefly in volcanoes possessing a certain degree of activity, while the other, sulphureted
hydrogen, has been most frequently perceived among those in a dormant condition.  The occurrence
of abundant exhalations of sulphuric acid, which have been hitherto noticed chiefly in extinct
volcanoes, as for instance, in a stream issuing from that of Purace, between Bogota and Quito,
from extinct volcanoes in Java, is satisfactorily explained in a recent paper by M. Dumas,
'Annales de Chimie', Dec., 1846. He shows that when sulphureted hydrogen, at a temperature
above 100 degrees Fahr., and still better when near 190 degrees, comes in contact with certain
porous bodies, a catalytic action is set up, by which water, sulphuric acid, and sulphur are
produced.  Hence probably the vast deposits of sulphur, associated with sulphates of lime and
strontian, which are met with in the western parts of Sicily.] -- Tr.

Such effusions p 218 from the fissures of the earth not only occur in the districts of still
burning or long-extinguished volcanoes, but they may likewise be observed occasionally in districts
where neither trachyte nor any other volcanic rocks are exposed on the earth's surface.  In
the chain of Quindiu I have seen sulphur deposited in mica slate from warm sulphurous vapor
at an elevation of 6832 feet* above the level of the sea, while the same species of rock, which
was formerly regarded as primitive, contains, in the Cerro Cuello, near Tiscan, south of Quito,
an immense deposit of sulphur imbedded in pure quartz.

[footnote]  * Humboldt, 'Recucil d'Observ. Astronomiques', t. i., p. 311 ('Nivellement Barometrique
de la Cordillere des Andes', No. 206).

Exhalations of carbonic acid ('mofettes') are even in our days to be considered as the most
important of all gaseous emanations, with respect to their number and the amount of their effusion.
We see in Germany, in the deep valleys of the Eifel, in the neighborhood of the Lake of Laach,*
in the crater-like valley of the Wehr and in Western Bohemia, exhalations of carbonic acid
gas manifest themselves as the last efforts of volcanic activity in or near the foci of an
earlier world.

[footnote]  *[The Lake of Laach, in the district of the Eifel, is an expanse of water two miles
in circumference.  The thickness of the vegetation on the sides of its crater-like basin renders
it difficult to discover the nature of the subjacent rock, but it is probably composed of black
cellular augitic lava.  The sides of the crater present numerous loose masses, which appear
to have been ejected, and consist of glassy feldspar, ice-spar, sodalite, hauyne, spinellane,
and leucite.  The resemblance between these products and the masses formerly ejected from Vesuvius
is most remarkable.  (Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', p. 81.)  Dr. Hibbert regards the Lake of Laach
as formed in the first instance by a crack caused by the cooling of the crust of the earth,
which was widened afterward into a circular cavity by the expansive force of elastic vapors.
See 'History of the Extinct Volcanoes of the Basin of Neuwied', 1832.] -- Tr.

In those earlier periods, when a higher terrestrial temperature existed, and when a great number
of fissures still remained unfilled, the processes we have described acted more powerfully,
and carbonic acid and hot steam were mixed in larger quantities in the atmosphere, from whence
it follows, as Adolph Bronguiart has ingeniously shown,* that the primitive vegetable world
must have exhibited almost every where, and independently of geographical position, the most
luxurious abundance and the fullest development of organism.

[footnote]  *Adolph Bronguiart, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t. xv., p. 225.

In these constantly warm and damp atmospheric strata, saturated with p 219 carbonic acid, vegetation
must have attained a degree of vital activity, and derived the superabundance of nutrition
necessary to furnish materials for the formation of the beds of lignite (coal) constituting
the inexhaustible means on which are based the physical power and prosperity of nations.  Such
masses are distributed in basins over certain parts of Europe, occurring in large quantities
in the British Islands, in Belgium, in France, in the provinces of the Lower Rhine, and in
Upper Silesia.  At the same primitive period of universal volcanic activity, those enormous
quantities of carbon must also have escaped from the earth which are contained in limestone
rocks, and which, if seprated from oxygen and reduced to a solid form, would constitute about
the eighth part of the absolute bulk of these mountain masses.*

[footnote]  * Bischof, op. cit., s. 324, Anm. 2.

That portion of the carbon which was not taken up by alkaline earths, but remained mixed with
the atmosphere, as carbonic acid, was gradually consumed by the vegetation of the earlier stages
of processes of vegetable life, only retained the small quantity which it now possesses, and
which is not injurious to the sulphurous vapor have occasioned the destruction of the species
of mollusca and fish which inhabited the inland waters of the earlier world, and have given
rise to the formation of the contorted beds of gypsum, which have doubtless been frequently
affected by shocks of earthquakes.

Gaseous and liquid fluids, mud, and molten earths, ejected from the craters of volcanoes, which
are themselves only a kind of "intermittent springs," rise from the earth under precisely analogous
physical relations.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 43.

All these substances owe their temperature and their chemical character to the place of their
origin.  The 'mean' temperature of aqueous springs is less than that of the air at the point
whence they emerge, if the water flow from a height; but their heat increases with the depth
of the strata with which they are in contact at their origin.  We have already spoken of the
numerical law regulating this increase.  The blending of waters that have come from the height
of a mountain with those that have sprung from the depths of the earth, render it difficult
to determine the position of the 'isogeothermal lines'* (lines of equal internal p 220 terrestrial
temperature, when this determination is to be made from the temperature of flowing springs.

[footnote]  *On the theory of isogeothermal (chthonisothermal) lines, consult the ingenious
labors of Kupffer, in Pogg, 'Annalen', bd xv., s. 184, and bd xxxii., s. 270, in the 'Voyage
dans l'Oural', p. 382-298, and in the 'Edinburgh Journal of Science', New Series, vol. iv.,
p. 355.  See, also, Kamtz, 'Lehrb. der Meteor.', bd. ii., s. 217; and, on the ascent of the
chthonisothermal lines in mountainous districts, Bischof, s. 174-198.

Such at any rate, is the result I have arrived at from my own observations and those of my
fellow-travelers in Northern Asia.  The temperature of springs, which has become the subject
of such continuous physical investigation during the last half century, depends, like the elevation
of the line of perpetual snow, on very many simultaneous and deeply-involved causes.  It is
a function of the temperature of the stratum in which they take their rise, of the specific
heat of the soil, and of the quantity and temperature of the meteoric water,* which is itself
different from the temperature of the lower strata of the atmosphere, according to the different
modes of its origin in rain, snow, or hail.**

[footnote]  *Leop. v. Buch, in Pogg., 'Annalen', bd. xii., s. 405.

[footnote]  ** On the temperature of the drops, of rain in Cumana, which fell to 72 degrees,
when the temperature of the air shortly before had been 86 degrees and 88 degrees, and during
the rain sank to 74 degrees, see my 'Relat. Hist.', t. ii., p. 22.  The rain-drops, while falling,
change the normal temperature they originally possessed, which depends on the height of the
clouds from which they fell, and their heating on their upper surface by the solar rays.  The
rain-drops, on their first production, have a higher temperature than the surrounding medium
in the superior strata of our atmosphere, in consequence of the liberation of their latent
heat; and they continue to rise in temperature, since, in falling through lower and warmer
strata, vapor is precipitated on them, and they thus increase in size (Bischof, 'Warmelehre
des inneren Erdkorpers' s. 73); but this additional heating is compensated for by evaporation.
These are the ordinary relations of the phenomenon.  When, as occasionally happens, the rain-drops
are warmer than the lower strata of the atmosphere (Humboldt, 'Rel. Hist.', t. iii., p. 513),
the cause must probably be sought in higher warmer currents, or in a higher temperature of
widely-extended and not very thick clouds, from the action of the sun's rays.  How, moreover,
the phenomenon of supplementary rainbows, which are explained by the interference of light,
is connected with the original and increasing size of the falling drops, and how an optical
phenomenon, if we know how to observe it accurately, may enlighten us regarding a meteorological
process, according to diversity of zone, has been shown, with much talent and ingenuity, by
Arago, in the 'Annuaire' for 1836, p. 300.

Cold springs can only indicate the mean atmospheric temperature p 221 when they are unmixed
with the waters rising from great depths, or descending from considerable mountain elevations,
and when they have passed through a long course at a depth from the surface of the earth which
is equal in our latitudes to 40 or 60 feet, and according to Boussingault, to about one foot
in the equinoctial regions,* these being the depths at which the invariability of the temperature
begins in the temperate and torrid zones, that is to say, the depths at which horary, diurnal,
and monthly changes of heat in the atmosphere cease to be perceived.

[footnote]  * The profound investigations of Boussingault fully convince me, that in the tropics,
the temperature of the ground, at a very slight depth, exactly corresponds with the mean temperature
of the air.  The following instances are sufficient to illustrate this fact:

The doubts about the temperature of the earth within the tropics, of which I am probably, in
some degree, the cause, by my observations on the Cave of Caripe (Cueva del Guacharo), 'Rel.
Hist.', t. iii., p. 191-196), are resolved by the consideration that I compared the presumed
mean temperature of the air of the convent of Caripe, 65.3 degrees, not with the temperature
of the air of the cave, 65.6 degrees, but with the temperature of the subterranean stream,
62.3degrees, although I observed ('Rel. Hist.', t. iii., p. 146 and 195) that mountain water
from a great height might probably be mixed with the water of the cave.

Hot springs issue from the most various kinds of rocks.  The hottest permanent springs that
have hitherto been observed are, as my own researches confirm, at a distance from all volcanoes.
I will here advert to a notice in my journal of the Aguas Calientes de las Trincheras', in
South America, between Porto Cabello and Nueva Valencia, and the 'Aguas de Comangillas', in
the Mexican territory, near Guanaxuato; the former of these, which issued from granite, had
a temperature of 194.5 degrees; the latter, issuing from basalt, 205.5degrees.  The depth of
the source from whence the water flowed with this temperature, judging from what we know of
the law of the increase of heat in the interior of the earth, was probably 7140 feet, or above
two miles.  If the universally-diffused terrestrial heat be the cause of thermal springs, as
of active volcanoes, the rocks can only exert an influence by the different capacities p 222
for heat and by their conducting powers.  The hottest of all permanent springs (between 203
degrees and 209 degrees) are likewise, in a most remarkable degree, the purest, and such as
hold in solution the smallest quantity of mineral substances.  Their temperature appears, on
the whole, to be less constant than that of springs between 122 degrees and 165 degrees, which
in Europe, at least, have maintained, in a most remarkable manner, their 'invariability of
heat and mineral contents' during the last fifty or sixty years, a period in which thermometrical
measurements and chemical analyses have been applied with increasing exactness.  Boussingault
found in 1823 that the thermal springs of Las Tricheras had risen 12 degrees during the twenty-three
years that had intervened since my travels in 1800.*

[footnote]  *Boussingault, in the 'Annales de chimie', t. lii., p. 181.  The spring of Chaudes
Aigues, in Auvergne, is only 176degrees.  It is also to be observed, that while the Aguas Calientes
de las Trincheras, south of Porto Cabello (Venezuela), springing from granite cleft in regular
beds, and far from all volcanoes, have a temperature of fully 206.6 degrees, all the springs
which rise in the vicinity of still active volcanoes (Pasto, Cotopaxi, and Tunguragua) have
a temperature of only 97 - 130 degrees.

This calmly-flowing spring is therefore now nearly 12 degrees hotter than the intermittent
fountains of the Geyser and the Strokr, whose temperature has recently been most carefully
determined by Krug of Nidda.  A very striking proof of the origin of hot springs by the sinking
of cold meteoric water into the earth, and by its contact with a volcanic focus, is afforded
by the volcano of Jorulla in Mexico, which was unknown before my American journey.  When, in
September, 1759, Jorullo was suddenly elevated into a mountain 1183 feet above the level of
the surrounding plain, two small rivers, the 'Rio de Cuitimba' and 'Rio de San Pedro', disappeared,
and some time afterward burst forth again, during violent shocks of an earthquake, as hot springs,
whose temperature I found in 1803 to be 186.4 degrees.

The springs in Greece still evidently flow at the same places as in the times of Hellenic antiquity.
The spring of Erasinos, two hours' journey to the south of Argos, on the declivity of Chaon,
is mentioned by Herodotus. At Delphi we still see Cassotis (now the springs of St. Nicholas)
rising south of the Lesche, and flowing beneath the Temple of Apollo; Castalia, at the foot
of Phaedriadae; Pirene, near Acro-Corinth; and the hot baths of Aedipsus, in Euboea, in which
Sulla bathed during the Mithridatic war.*

I advert with pleasure to these p 223 facts, as they show us that, even in a country subject
to frequent and violent shocks of earthquakes, the interior of our planet has retained for
upward of 2000 years its ancient configuration in reference to the course of the open fissures
that yield a passage to these waters.  The 'Fontaine jaillissante' of Lillers, in the Department
des Pas de Calais, which was bored as early as the year 1126, still rises to the same height
and yields the same quantity of water; and, as another instance, I may mention that the admirable
geographer of the Caramanian coast, Captain Beaufort, saw in the district of Phaselis the same
flame fed by emissions of inflammable gas which was described by Pliny as the flame of the
Lycian Chimera.*

[footnnote]  (Pliny, ii., 106; Seneca, 'Epist.' 79, 3, ed. Ruhkopf (Beaufort, 'Survey of the
Coast of Karamania', 1820, art. Yanar, near Delktasch, the ancient Phaselis, p. 24).  See also

from the Deliktash, on the side of a mountain, is the perpetual fire described by Captain Beaufort.
The travelers found it as brilliant as ever, and even somewhat increased; for, besides the
large flame in the corner of the ruins described by Beaufort, there were small jets issuing
from crevices in the side of the crater-like cavity five or six feet deep. At the bottom was
a shallow pool of sulphureous and turbid water, regarded by the Turks as a sovereign remedy
for all skin complaints.  The soot deposited from the flames was regarded as efficacious for
sore eyelids, and valued as a dye for the eyebrows."  See the highly interesting and accurate
work, 'Travels in Lycia', by Lieut. Spratt and Professor E. Forbes.] -- Tr.

The observation made by Arago in 1821, that the deepest Artesian wells are the warmest,* threw
great light on the origin of thermal springs, and on the establishment of the law that terrestrial
heat increases with increasing depth.

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire pour' 1835, p. 234.

It is a remarkable fact, which has but recently been noticed, that at the close of the third
century, St. Patricus,* probably Bishop of Pertusa, was led to adopt very correct views regarding
the phenomenon of the hot springs at Carthage.

[footnote]  *'Acta S. Patricii', p. 555, ed. Ruinart, t. ii., p. 385, Mazochi.  Dureau de la
Malle was the first to draw attention to this remarkable passage in the 'Recherches sur la
Topographie de Carthage', 1835, p. 276.  (See, also, Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.', iii., 24.)

On being asked what was the cause of boiling water bursting from the earth, he replied, "Fire
is nourished in the clouds and in the interior p 224 of the earth, as Aetna and other mountains
near Naples may teach you.  The subterranean waters rise as if through siphons.  The cause
of hot springs is this:  waters which are more remote from the subterranean fire are colder,
while those which rise nearer the fire are heated by it, and bring with them to the surface
which we inhabit an insupportable degree of heat."

As earthquakes are often accompanied by eruptions of water and vapors, we recognize in the
'Salses',* of small mud volcanoes, a transition from the changing phenomena presented by these
eruptions of vapor and thermal springs to the more powerful and awful activity of the streams
of lava that flow from volcanic mountains.

[footnote]  *[True volcanoes, as we have seen, generate sulphureted hydrogen and muriatic acid,
upheave tracts of land, and omit streams of melted feldspathic materials; salses, on the contrary,
disengage little else but carbureted hydrogen, together with bitumen and other products of
the distillation of coal, and pour forth no other torrents except of mud, or argillaceous materials
mixed up with water.  Daubeney, op cit., p. 540.] -- Tr.

If we consider these mountains as springs of molten earths producing volcanic rocks, we must
remember that thermal water, when impregnated with carbonic acid and sulphurous gases, are
continually forming horizontally ranged strata of limestone (travertine) or conical elevations,
as in Northern Africa (in Alberia), and in the Banos of Caxamarca, on the western declivity
of the Peruvian Cordilleras.  The travertine of Van Diemen's Land (near Hobart Town) contains,
according to Charles Darwin, remains of a vegetation that no longer exists.  Lava and travertine,
which are constantly forming before our eyes, present us with the two extremes of geognostic
relations.

'Salses' deserve more attention than they have hitherto received from geognosists.  Their grandeur
has been overlooked because of the two conditions to which they are subject; it is only the
more peaceful state, in which they may continue for centuries, which has generally been described:
their origin is, however, accompanied by earthquakes, subterranean thunder, the elevation of
a whole district, and lofty emissions of flame of short duration.  When the mud volcano of
Jokmali began to form on the 27th of November, 1827, in the peninsula of Abscheron, on the
Caspian Sea, east of Baku, the flames flashed up to an extraordinary height for three hours,
while during the next twenty hours they scarcely rose three feet above the crater, from which
mud was ejected.  Near the village of Baklichli, west of Baku, the flames rose so high that
p 225 they could be seen at a distance of twenty-four miles.  Enormous masses of rock were
torn up and scattered around.  Similar masses may be seen round the now inactive mud volcano
of Monte Ziblo, near Sassuolo, in Northern Italy.  The secondary condition of repose has been
maintained for upward of fifteen centuries in the mud volcanoes of Girgenti, the 'Macalubi',
in Sicily, which have been described by the ancients.  These salses consist of many contitiguous
conical hills, from eight to ten, or even thirty feet in height, subject to variations of elevation
as well as of form.  Streams of argillaceous mud, attended by a periodic development of gas,
flow from the small basins at the summits, which are filled with water; the mud, although usualy
cold is sometimes at a high temperature, as at Damak, in the province of Samarang, in the island
of Java.  The gases that are developed with loud noise differ in their nature consisting for
instance, of hydrogen mixed with naphtha, or of carbonic acid, or, as Parrot and myself have
shown (in the peninsula of Taman, and in the 'Volcancitos de Turbaco', in South America), of
almost pure nitrogen.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Rel. Hist.', t. iii., p. 562-567; 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 43; t.
ii., p. 505-515; 'Vues des Cordilleres', pl. xli. Regarding the 'Macalubi', the 'overthrown'
or 'inverted', from the word 'Khalaba'), and on "the Earth ejecting fluid earth," see Solinus,
cap. 5: "idem ager Agrigentinus eructat limosas scaturigenes, et ut venae fontium sufficiunt
rivis subjinistrandis, ita in hac Sicilae parte solo munquam deficiente, Aeterna rejectatione
terram terra evomit."

Mud volcanoes, after the first violent explosion of fire, which is not, perhaps, in an equal
degree common to all, present to the spectator an image of the uninterrupted but weak activity
of the interior of our planet.  The communication with the deep strata in which a high temperature
prevails is soon closed, and the coldness of the mud emissions of the salses seems to indicate
that the seat of the phenomenon can not be far removed from the surface during their ordinary
condition.  The reaction of the interior of the earth on its external surface is exhibited
with totally different force in true volcanoes or igneous mountains, at points of the earth
in which a permanent, or, at least, continually-renewed connection with the volcanic force
is manifested.  We must here carefully distinguish between the more or less intensely developed
volcanic phenomena, as for instance, between earthquakes, thermal, aqueous, and gaseous springs,
mud volcanoes, and the appearance of bell-formed or dome-shaped trachytic rocks without openings;
the opening of these rocks, or of the elevated beds of basalt, as p 226 craters of elevation;
and, lastly, the elevation of a permanent volcano in the crater of elevation, or among the
'debris' of its earlier formation.  At different periods, and in different degrees of activity
and force, the permanent volcanoes emit steam acids, luminous scoriae, or, when the resistance
can be overcome, narrow, band-like streams of molten earths. Elastic vapors sometimes elevate
either separate portions of the earth's crust into dome-shaped unopened masses of feldspathic
trachyte and dolerite (as in Puy de Dome and Chimborazo), in consequence of some great or local
manifestation of force in the interior of our planet, or the upheaved strata are broken through
and curved in such a manner as to form a steep rocky ledge on the opposite inner side, which
then constitutes the inclosure of a crater of elevation.  If this rocky ledge has been uplifted
from the bottom of the sea, which is by no means always the case, it determines the whole physiognomy
and form of the island.  In this manner has arisen the circular form of Palma, which has been
described with such admirable accuracy by Leopold von Buch, and that of Nisyros,* in the Aegean
sea.

[footnote]  *See the interesting little map of the island of Nisyros, in Roise's 'Reisen auf
den Griechischen Inseln', bd. ii., 1843, s. 69.

Sometimes half of the annular ledge has been destroyed, and in the bay formed by the encroachment
of the sea corallines have built their cellular habitations.  Even on continents craters of
elevation are often filled with water, and embellish in a peculiar manner the character of
the landscape. Their origin is not connected with any determined species of rock:  they break
out in basalt, trachyte, leucitic porphyry (somma), or in doleritic mixtures of augite and
labradorite; and hence arise the different nature and external conformation of these inclosures
of craters.  No phenomena of eruption are manifested in such craters, as they open no permanent
channel of communication with the interior, and it is but seldom that we meet with traces of
volcanic activity either in the neighborhood or in the interior of these craters.  The force
which was able to produce so important an action must have been long accumulating in the interior
before it could overpower the resistance of the mass pressing upon it; it sometimes, for instance,
on the origin of new islands, will raise granular rocks and conglomerated masses (strata of
tufa filled with marine plants) above the surface of the sea.  The compressed vapors escape
through the crater of elevation, but a large mass soon falls back and closes the opening, which
had been only formed by these manifestations of force.  No volcano can, therefore, p be produced.*

[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, 'Phys. Beschreibung der Canarischen Inseln', s. 326; and his
Memoir 'uber Erhebungscratere und Vulcane', in Poggend., 'Annal.', bd. xxxvii., s. 169. In
his remarks on the separation of Sicily from Calabria, Strbo gives an excellend description
of the two modes in which islands are formed:  "Some islands," he observes (lib. vi., p. 258,
ed. Casaub.), "are fragments of the continent, others have arisen from the sea, as even at
the present time is known to happen; for the islands of the great ocean, lying far from the
main land, have probably been raised from its depths, while, on the other hand, those near
promontories appear (according to reason) to have been separated from the continent."

A volcano, properly so called, exists only where a permanent connection is established between
the interior of the earth and the atmosphere, and the reaction of the interior on the surface
then continues during long periods of time.  It may be interrupted for centuries, as in the
case of Vesuvius Fisove,* and then manifest itself with renewed activity.

[footnote]  *Ocre Fisove (Mons Vesuvius) in the Umbrian language.  (Lassen 'Deutung der Eugubinischen
Tafeln in Rhein. Museum', 1832, s. 387.)  The word 'ochre' is very probaby genuine Umbrian,
and means, according to Festus, 'mountain'.  Aetna would be a burning and shining mountain,
if Voss is correct in stating that [Greek work] is an Hellenic sound, and is connected with
[Greed word] and [Greek word]; but the intelligent writer Parthey doubts this Hellenic origin
on etymological grounds, and also because etna was by no means regarded as a luminous beacon
for ships or wanderers, in the same manner as the ever-travailing Stromboli (Strongyle), to
which Homer seems to refer in the Odyssey (xii., 68, 202, and 219), and its geographical position
was not so well determined.  I suspect that tna would be found to be a Sicilian word, if we
had any fragmentary materials to refer to.  According to Diodorus (v., 6), the Sicani, or aborigines
preceding the Sicilians, were compelled to fly to the western part of the island, in the consequence
of successive eruptions extending over many years.  The most ancient eruption of Mount Aetna
on record is that mentioned by Pindar and Schylus, as occurring under Hiero, in the second
year of the 75th Olympiad.  It is probable that Hesiod was aware of the devastating eruptions
of Aetna before the period of Greek immigration.  There is, however, some doubt regarding the
work [Greek word] in the text of Hesiod, a subject into whci I have entered at some length
in another place. (Humboldt, 'Examen Crit. de le Geogr.', t. i., p. 168.)

In the time of Nero, men were disposed to rank Aetna among the volcanic mountains which were
graduallybecoming extinct,* and subsequently Aelian** even maintained that mariners could no
longer see the sinking summit of the mountain from so great a distance at sea.

[footnote]  *Seaeca.  'Epist.', 79.

[footnote]  ** Aelian, 'Var. Hist.', viii., 11.

Where these evidences -- these old scaffoldings of eruption, I might almost say -- still exist,
the volcano rises from a crater of elevation, while a high rocky wall surrounds, like an amphitheater,
the isolated conical mount, and forms around it a kind of easing of highly elevated p 228 strata.
Occasionally not a trace of this inclosure is visible, and the volcano, which is not always
conical rises immediately from the neighboring plateau in an elongated form, as in the case
of Pichincha,* at the foot of which lies the city of Quito.

[footnote]  *[This mountain contains two funnel-shaped craters, apparently resulting from two
set of eruptions:  the western nearly circular, and having in its center a cone of eruption,
from the summit and sides of which are no less than seventy vents, some in activity and others
extinct.  It is probable that the larger number of the vents were produced at periods anterior
to history.  Caubney, op. cit., p. 488.] -- Tr.

As the nature of rocks, or the mixture (grouping) of simple minerals into
granite, gneiss, and mica slate, or into trachyte, basalt, and dolorite, is
independent of existing climates, and is the same under the most varied
latitudes of the earth, so also we find every where in inorganic nature that
the same laws of configuration regulate the reciprocal superposition of the
strata of the earth's crust, cause them to penetrate one another in the form
of veins, and elevate them by the agency of elastic forces.  This constant
recurrence of the same phenomena is most strikingly manifested in volcanoes.
 When the mariner, amid the islands of some distant archipelago, is no
longer guided by the light of the same stars with which he had been familiar
in his native latitude, and sees himself surrounded by palms and other forms
of an exotic vegetation, he still can trace, reflected in the individual
characteristics of the landscape, the forms of Vesuvius, of the come-shaped
summits of Auvergne, the craters of elevation in the Canaries and Azores, or
the fissures of eruption in Iceland.  A glance at the satellite of our
planet will impart a wider generalization to this analogy of configuration.
by means of the charts that have been drawn in accordance with the
observations made with large telescopes, we may recognize in the moon, where
water and air are both absent, vast craters of elevation surrounding or
supporting conical mountains, thus affording incontrovertible evidence of
the effects produced by the reaction of the interior on the surface, favored
by the influence of a feebler force of gravitation.

Although vocanoes are justy termed in many languages "fire-emitting mountains," mountains of
this kind are not formed by the gradual accumulation of ejected currents of lava, but their
origin seems rather to be a general consequence of the sudden elevation of soft masses of trachyte
or labradoritic augite.  The amount of the elevating force is manifested p 229 by the elevation
of the volcano, which varies from the inconsiderable height of a hill (as the volcano of Cosima,
one of the Japanese Kurile islands) to that of a cone above 19,000 feet in height.  It has
appeared to me that relations of height have a great influence on the occurrence of eruptions,
which are more frequent in low than in elevated volcanoes.  I might instance the series presented
by the following mountains:  Stromboli, 2318 feet; Guacamayo, in the province of Quixos, from
which detonations are heard almost daily (I myself often heard them at Chillo, near Quito,
a distance of eighty-eight miles); Vesuvius, 3876 feet; Aetna, 10871 feet; the Peak of Teneriffe,
12,175 feet; and Cotopaxi, 19,069 feet.  If the focus of these volcanoes be at an equal depth
below the surface, a greater force must be required where the fused masses have to be raised
to an elevation six or eight times greater than that of the lower eminences.  While the volcano
Stromboli (Strongyle) has been incessantly active since the Homeric ages, and has served as
a beacon-light to guide the mariner in the Tyrrhenian Sea, loftier volcanoes have been characterized
by loong intervals of quiet.  Thus we see that a whole century often intervenes between the
eruptions of most of the colossi which crown the summits of the Cordilleras of the Andes. Where
we meet with exceptions to this law, to which I long since drew attention, they must depend
upon the circumstance that the connections between the volcanic foci and the crater of eruption
can not be considered as equaly permanent in the case of all volcanoes.  The channel of communication
may be closed for a time in the case of the lower ones, so that they less frequently come to
a state of eruption, although they do not, on that account, approach more nearly to their final
extinction.

These relations between the absolute height and the frequency of volcanic eruptions, as far
as they are externally perceptible, are intimately connected with the consideration of the
local conditions under which lava currents are erupted.  Eruptions from the crater are very
unusual in many mountains, generally occurring from lateral fissures (as was observed in the
case of Aetna, in the sixteenth century, by the celebrated historian Bembo, when a youth*),
whenever the sides p 230 of the upheaved mountain were least able, from their configuration
and position, to offer any resistance.

[footnote]  *Petri Bembi Opuscula ('Aetna Dialogus'), Basil, 1556, p. 63: "Quicquid in Aetnae
matris utero coulescit, nunquam exit ex cratere superiore, quod vel eo inscondere gravis materia
non queat, vel, quia inferius alia spiramenta sunt, non fit opus.  Despumant flammis urgentibus
ignei rivi pigro fluxu totas delambentes plagas, et in lapidem indurescunt."

Cones of eruption are sometimes uplifted on these fissures; the larger ones, which are erroneously
termed 'new volcanoes', are ranged together in line marking the direction of a fissure, which
is soon reclosed, while the smaller ones are grouped together covering a whole district with
their dome-like or hive-shaped forms.  To the latter belong the 'hornitos de Jorullo',I the
cone of Vesuvius erupted in October, 1822, that of Awatscha, according to Postels, and those
of the lava-field mentioned by Erman, near the Baidar Mountains, in the peninsula of Kamtschatka.

[footnote]  See my drawing of the volcano of Jorullo, of its 'hornitos', and of the uplifted
'malpays', in my 'Vues de Cordilleres', pl. xliii., p. 239. [Burckhardt states that during
the twenty-four years that have intervened since Baron Humboldt's visit to Jorullo, the 'hornitos'
have either wholly disappeared or completely changed their forms.  See 'Aufenthalt und Reisen
in Mexico in 1825 und 1834'.] -- Tr.

When volcanoes are not isolated in a plain, but surrounded, as in the double chain of the Andes
of Quito, by a table-land having an elevation from nine to thirteen thousand feet, this circumstance
may probably explain the cause why no lava streams are formed* during the most dreadful eruption
of ignited scoriae accompanied by detonations heard at a distance of more than a hundred miles.

[footnote]  * Humboldt, 'Essaii sur la Geogr. des Plantes et Tableau Phys. des Regions Equinoxiales',
1807, p. 130, and 'Essai Geogn. sur le Gisement des Roches', p. 321.  Most of the volcanoes
in Java demonstrate that the cause of the perfect absence of lava streams in volcanoes of incessant
activity is not alone to be sought for in their form, position, and height. Leop. von Buch,
'Descr. Phys. des Iles Canaries', p. 419; Reinwardt and Hoffmann, in Poggened., 'Annalen.',
bd. xii., s. 607.

Such are the volcanoes of Popayan, those of the elevated plateau of Los Pastos and of the Andes
of Quito, with the exception, perhaps, in the case of the latter, of the volcano of Antisana.
The height of the cone of cinders, and the size and form of the crater, are elements of configuration
which yield an especial and individual character to volcanoes, although the cone of cinders
and the crater are both wholly independent of the dimensions of the mountain.  Vesuvius is
more than three times lower than the Peak of Teneriffe; its cone of cinders rises to one third
of the height of the whole mountain, while the cone of cinders of the Peak is only 1/22d of
its altitude.

[footnote]  * [It may be remarked in general, although the rule is liable to exceptions, that
the dimensions of a crater are in an inverse ratio to the elevation of the mountain.  Daubeney,
op. Cit., p. 444.] -- Tr.

In a much higher volcano than that of Teneriffe, the Rueu Pichincha, other relations occur
p 231 which approach more nearly to that of Vesuvius.  Among all the volcanoes that I have
seen in the two hemispheres, the conical form of Cotopaxi is the most beautifully regular.
A sudden fusion of the snow at its cone of cinders announces the proximity of the eruption.
Before the smoke is visible in the rarefied strata of air surrounding the summit and the opening
of the crater, the walls of the cone of cinders are sometimes in a state of glowing heat, when
the whole mountain presents an appearance of the most fearful and portentous blackness.  The
crater, which, with very few exceptions, occupies the summit of the volcano, forms a deep,
caldron-like valley, which is often accessible, and whose bottom is subject to constant alterations.
The great or lesser depth of the crater is in many volcanoes likewise a sign of the near or
distant occurrence of an eruption.  Long, narrow fissures, from which vapors issue forth, or
small rounding hollows filled with molten masses, alternately open and close in the caldron-like
valley; the bottom rises and sinks, eminences of scoriae and cones of eruption are formed,
rising sometimes far over the walls of the crater, and continuing for years together to impart
to the volcano a peculiar character, and then suddenly fall together and disappear during a
new eruption.  The openings of these cones of eruption, which rise from the bottom of the crater,
must not, as is too often done, be confounded with the crater which incloses them.  If this
be inaccessible from extreme depth and from the perpendicular descent, as in the case of the
volcano of Rucu Pichincha, which is 15,920 feet in height, the traveler may look from the edge
on the summit of the mountains which rise in the sulphurous atmosphere of the valley at his
feet; and I have never beheld a grander or more remarkable picture than that presented by this
volcano.  In the interval between two eruptions, a crater may either present no luminous appearance,
showing merely open fissures and ascending vapors, or the scarcely heated soil may be covered
by eminences of scoriae, that admit of being approached without danger, and thus present to
the geologist the spectacle of the eruption of burning and fused masses, which fall back on
the ledge of the cone of scoriae, and whose appearance is regularly announced by small wholly
local earthquakes.  Lava sometimes streams forth from the open fissures and small hollows,
without breaking through or escaping beyond the sides of the crater.  If, however, it does
break through, the newly-opened terrestrial stream generally flows in such a quiet and well-defined
course, that the deep valley, which we term the crater, remains accessible p 232 even during
periods of eruption.  It is impossible, without an exact representation of the configuration
-- the normal type, as it were, of fire-emitting mountains, to form a just idea of those phenomena
which, owing to fantastic descriptions and an undefined phraseology, have long been comprised
under the head of 'craters, cones of eruption', and 'volcanoes'. The marginal ledges of craters
vary much less than one would be led to suppose.  A comparison of Saussure's measurements with
my own yields the remarkable result, for instance, that in the course of forty-nine years (from
1773 to 1822), the elevation of the northwestern margin of Mount Vesuvius ('Rocca del Palo')
may be considered to have remained unchanged.*

[footnote]  *See the ground-work of my measurements compared with those of Saussure and Lord
Minto, in the 'Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wiss. zu Berlin' for the years 1822 and 1823.

Volcanoes which, like the chain of the Andes, lift their summits high above the boundaries
of the region of perpetual snow, present peculiar phenomena. The masses of snow, by their sudden
fusion during eruptions, occasion not only the most fearful inundations and torrents of water,
in which smoking scoriae are borne along on thick masses of ice, but they likewise exercise
a constant action, while the volcano is in a state of perfect repose, by infiltration into
the fissures of the trachytic rock.  Cavities which are either on the declivity or at the foot
of the mountain are gradually converted into subterranean resevoirs of water, which communicate
by numerous narrow openings with mountain streams, as we see exemplified in the highlands of
Quito.  the fishes of these rivulets multiply, especially in the obscurity of the hollows;
and when the shocks of earthquakes, which precede all eruptions in the andes, have violently
shaken the whole mass of the volcano, these subterranean caverns are suddenly opened, and water,
fishes, and tufaceous mud are all ejected together.  It is through this singular phenomenon*
that the inhabitants of the highlands of Quito became acquainted with the existence of the
little cyclopic fishes, termed by them the prenadilla.

[footnote]  *Pimelodes cyclopum.  See Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Observations de Zoologie et d'Anatomie
Comparee', t. i., p. 21-25.

On the night between the 19th and 20th of June, 1698, when the summit of Carguairazo, a mountain
19,720 feet in height, fell in, leaving only two huge masses of rock remaining of the ledge
of the crater, a space of nearly thirty-two square miles was overflowed and devastated by streams
of liquid tufa and argillaceous mud ('lodazales'), containing large quantities of dead fish.
p 233 In like manner, the putrid fever, which raged seven years previously in the mountain
town of Ibarra, north of Quito, was ascribed to the ejection of fish from the volcano of Imbaburu.*

[footnote]  *[It would appear, as there is no doubt that these fishes proceed from the mountain
itself, that there must be large lakes in the interior, which in ordinary season are out of
the immediate influence of the volcanic action.  See Daubeney, op. cit., p. 488, 497.] -- Tr.

Water and mud, which flow not from the crater itself, but from the hollows in the trachytic
mass of the mountain, can not, strictly speaking, be classed among volcanic phenomena.  They
are only indirectly connected with the volcanic activity of the mountain, resembling, in that
respect, the singular meteorological process which I have designated in my earlier writings
by the term of 'volcanic storm'.  The hot stream which rises from the crater during the eruption
and spreads itself in the atmosphere, condenses into a cloud, and surrounds the column of fire
and cinders which rises to an altitude of many thousand feet.  The sudden condensation of the
vapors, and, as Gay-Lussac has shown, the formation of a cloud of enormous extent, increase
the electric tension.  Forked lightning flashes from the column of cinders, and it is then
easy to distinguish (as at the close of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in the latter end of
October, 1822) the rolling thunder of the volcanic storm from the detonations in the interior
of the mountain.  the flashes of lightning that darted from the volcanic cloud of steam, as
we learn from Olafsen's report, killed eleven horses and two men, on the eruption of the volcano
of Katlagia, in Iceland, on the 17th of October, 1755.

Having thus delineated the structure and dynamic activity of volcanoes, it now remains for
us to throw a glance at the differences existing in their material products.  The subterranean
forces sever old combinations of matter in order to produce new ones, and they also continue
to act upon matter as long as it is in a state of liquefaction from heat, and capable of being
displaced.  The greater or less pressure under which merely softened or wholly liquid fluids
are solidified, appears to constitute the main difference in the formation of Plutonic and
volcanic rocks.  The mineral mass which flows in narrow, elongated streams from a volcanic
opening (an earth-spring), is called lava.  where many such currents meet and are arrested
in their course, they expand in width, filling large basins, in which they become solidified
in superimposed strata.  These few sentences describe the general character of the products
of volcanic activity.

p 234 Rocks which are merely broken through by the volcanic action are often inclosed in the
igneous products.  Thus i have found angular fragments of feldspathic syenite imbedded in the
black augitic lava of the volcano of Jorullo, in Mexico; but the masses of dolomite and granular
limestone, which contain magnificent clusters of crystalling fossils (vesuvian and garnets,
covered with mejonite, nepheline, and sodalite), are not the ejected products of Vesuvius,
these belonging rather to very generally distributed formations, viz., strata of tufa, which
are more ancient than the elevation of the Somma and of Vesuvius, and are probably the products
of a deep-seated and concealed submarine volcanic action.*

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxvii., s. 179.

We find five metals among the products of existing volcanoes, iron, copper, lead, arsenic,
and selenium, discovered by Stromeyer in the crater of Volcano.*

[footnote]  *[The little island of Volcano is separated from Lipari by a
narrow channel.  It appears to have exhibited strong signs of volcanic
activity long before the Christian era, and still emits gaseous exhalations.
 Stromeyer detected the presence of selenium in a mixture of sal ammoniac
and sulphur.  Another product, supposed to be peculiar to this volcano, is
boracic acid, which lines the sides of the cavities in beautiful white silky
crystals.  Daubeney, op. cit., p. 257.] -- Tr.

The vapors that rise from the 'fumarolles' cause the sublimation of the chlorids of iron, copper,
lead, and ammonium; iron glanceI and chlorid of sodium (the latter often in large quantities)
fill the cavities of recent lava streams and the fissures of the margin of the crater.

[footnote]  *Regarding the chemical origin of iron glance in volcanic masses, see Mitscherlich,
in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xv., s. 630; and on the liberation of hydrochloric acid in the
crater, see Gay-Lussac, in the 'Annals de Chimique et de Physique', t. xxii., p. 423.

The mineral composition of lava differs according to the nature of the crystalline rock of
which the volcano is formed, the height of the point where the eruption occurs, whether at
the foot of the mountain or in the neighborhood of the crater, and the condition of temperature
of the interior.  Vitreous volcanic formations, obsidian, pearl-stone, and pumice, are entirely
wanting in some volcanoes, while in the case of others they only proceed from the crater, or,
at any rate, from very considerable heights.  These important and involved relations can only
be explained by very accurate crystallographic and chemical investigations.  My fellow-traveler
in Siberia, Gustav Rose, and subsequently Hermann Abich, have already been able, by their fortunate
and ingenious researches, to throw much light on the structural relations of the various kinds
of volcanic rocks.

p 235 The greater part of the ascending vapor is mere steam.  When condensed, this forms springs,
as in Pantellaria,Iwhere they are used by the goatherds of the island.

[footnote]  *[Steam issues from many parts of this insular mountain, and several hot springs
gush forth from it, which form together a lake 6000 feet in circumference.  Daubeney, op. cit.]
-- Tr.

On the morning of the 26th of October, 1822, a current was seen to flow from a lateral fissure
of the crater of Vesuvius, and was loong supposed to have been boiling water; it was, however,
shown, by Monticelli's accurate investigations, to consist of dry ashes, which fell like sand,
and of lava pulverized by friction.  The ashes, which sometimes darken the air for hours and
days together, and produce great injury to the vineyards and olive groves by adhering to the
leaves, indicate by their columnar ascent, impelled by vapors, the termination of every great
eqrthquake.  This is the magnificent phenomenon which Pliny the younger, in his celebrated
letter to Cornelius Tacitus, compares, in the case of Vesuvius, to the form of a lofty and
thickly-branched and foliaceous pine.  That which is described as flames in the eruption of
scoriae, and the radiance of the glowing red clouds that hover over the crater, can not be
ascribed to the effect of hydrogen gas in a state of combustion.  They are rather reflections
of light which issue from molten masses, projected high in the air, and also reflections from
the burning depths, whence the glowing vapors ascend.  We will not, however, attempt to decide
the nature of the flames, which are occasionally seen now, as in the time of Strabo, to rise
from the deep sea during the activity of littoral volcanoes, or shortly before the elevation
of a volcanic island.

When the questions are asked, what is it that burns in the volcano? what excites the heat,
fuses together earths and metals, and imparts to lava currents of thick layers a degree of
heat that lasts for many years? it is necessarily implied that volcanoes must be connected
with the existence of substances capable of maintaining combustion, like the beds of coal in
subterranean fires.

[footnote]  *See the beautiful experiments on the cooling of masses of rock, in Bischof's 'Warmelehre',
s. 384, 443, 500-512.

According to the different phases of chemical science, bitumen, pyrites, the moist admixture
of finely-pulverized sulphur and iron, pyrophoric substances, and the metals of the alkalies
and earths, have in turn been designated as the cause of intensely active volcanic phenomena.
The great chemist, Sir Humphrey Davy, to whom we are indebted for the knowledge of the most
combustible metallic p 236 substances, has himself renounced his bold chemical hypothesis in
his last work ('Consolation in Travel, and last Days of a Philosopher') -- a work which can
not fail to excite in the reader a feeling of the deepest melancholy.  the great mean density
of the earth (5.44), when compared with the specific weight of potassium (0.865), of sodium
(-.972), or of the metals of the earths (1.2), and the absence of hydrogen gas in the gaseous
emanations from the fissures of craters, and from still warm streams of lava, besides many
chemical considerations, stand in opposition with the earlier conjectures of Davy and Ampere.*

[footnote]  *See Berzelius and Wohler, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. i., s. 221, and bd. xi.,
s. 146; Gay-Lussac, in the 'Annals de Chimie', t. x., xii., p. 422; and Bischof's 'Reasons
against the Chemical Theory of Volcanoes', in the English edition of his 'Warmelehre', p. 297-309.

If hydrogen were evolved from erupted lava, how great must be the quantity of the gas disengaged,
when, the seat of the volcanic activity being very low, as in the case of the remarkable eruption
at the foot of the Skaptar Jokul in Iceland (from the 11th of June to the 3d of August, 1783,
described by Mackenzie and Soemund Magnussen), a space of many square miles was covered by
streams of lava, accumulated to the thickness of several hundred feet!  Similar difficulties
are opposed to the assumption of the penetration of the atmospheric air into the crater, or,
as it is figuratively expressed, the 'inhalation of the earth', when we have regard to the
small quantity of nitrogen emitted.  So general, deep-seated, and far-propagated an activity
as that of volcanoes, can not assuredly have its source in chemical affinity, or in the mere
contact of individual or merely locally distributed substances.  Modern geognosy* rather seeks
the cause of this activity in the increased temperature with the increase of depth at all degrees
of latitude, in that powerful internal heat which our planet owes to its first solidification,
its formation in the regions of space, and to the spherical contraction of p 237 matter revolving
elliptically in a gaseous condition.

see Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', a work to which we have made continual reference during the preceding
pages, as it constitutes the most recent and perfect compendium of all the important facts
relating to this subject, and is peculiarly adapted to serve as a source of reference to the
'Cosmos', since the learned author in many instances enters into a full exposition of the views
advanced by Baron Humboldt.  The appendix contains several valuable notes with reference to
the most recent works that have appeared on the Continent, on subjects relating to volcanoes;

acid discharged from volcanoes," as enounced in his recently published work, 'Lehrbuch der

We have thus mere conjecture and supposition side by side with certain knowledge.  A philosophical
study of nature strives ever to elevate itself above the narrow requirements of mere natural
description, and does not consist, as we have already remarked, in the mere accumulation of
isolated facts.  The inquiring and active spirit of man must be suffered to pass from the present
to the past, to conjecture all that can not yet be known with certainty, and still to dwell
with pleasure on the ancient myths of geognosy which are presented to us under so many various
forms.  If we consider volcanoes as irregular intermittent springs, emitting a fluid mixture
of oxydized metals, alkalies, and earths, flowing gently and calmy wherever then find a passage,
or being upheaved by the powerful expansive force of vapors, we are involuntarily led to remember
the geognostic visions of Plato, according to which hot springs, as well as all volcanic igneous
streams, were eruptions that might be traced back to one generally distributed subterranean
cause, 'Pyriphlegethon'.*

[footnote]  *According to Plato's geognostic views, as developed in the
'Phaedo', Pyriphlegethon plays much the same part in relation to the
activity of volcanoes that we now ascribe to the augmentation of heat as we
descend from the earth's surface, and to the fused condition of its internal
strata.  ('Phaedo', ed. Ast, p. 603 and 607; Annot., p. 308 and 817.)
"Within the earth, and all around it, are larger and smaller caverns.  Water
flows there in abundance; also much fire and large streams of fire, and
streams of moist mud (some purer and others more filthy), like those in
Sicily, consisting of mud and fire, preceding the great eruption.  These
streams fill all places that fall in the way of their course.
Pyriphlegethon flows forth into an extensive district burning with a fierce
fire, where it forms a lake larger than our sea, boiling with water and mud.
 From thence it moves in circles round the earth, turbid and muddy."  This
stream of molten earth and mud is so much the general cause of volcanic
phenomena, that Plato expressly adds, "thus is Pyriphlegethon constituted,
from which also the streams of fire ([Greek words]), wherever they reach the
earth ([Greek words]), inflate such parts (detached fragments)."  Volcanic
scoriae and lava streams are therefore portions of Pyriphlegethon itself,
portions of the subterranean molten and ever-undulating mass.  That {Greek
words] are lava streams, and not, as Schneider, Passow, and Schleiermacher
will have it, "fire-vomiting mountains," is clear enough from many passages,
some of which have been collected by Ukert ('Geogr. der Griechen und Romer',
th. ii., s. 200): [Greek word] is the volcanic phenomenon in reference to
its most striking characteristic, the lava stream. Hence the expression, the
[Greek word] of Aetna.  Aristot. 'Mirab. Ausc.', t. ii., p. 833; sect. 38,
Bekker; Thucyd., iii., 116; Theophrast., 'De Lap'., 22, p. 427, Schneider;
Diod., v., 6, and xiv., 59, where are the remarkable words, "Many places
near the sea, in the neighborhood of Aetna, were leveled to the ground,
[Greek words];"  Strabo, vi., p. 269; xiii., p. 268, and where there is a
notice of the celebrated burning mud of the Lelantine plains, in Euboea, i.,
p. 58, Casaub.; and Appian, 'De Bello Civili', v., 114.  The blame which
Aristotle throws on the geognostical fantasies of the Phaedo ('Meteor.',
ii., 2, 19) is especially applied to the sources of the rivers flowing over
the earth's surface.  The distinct statement of Plato, that "in Sicily
eruptions of wet mud precede the glowing (lava) stream," is very remarkable.
 Observations on Aetna could not have led to such a statement, unless pumice
and ashes, formed into a mud-like mass by admixture with melted snow and
water, during the volcano-electric storm in the crater of eruption, were
mistaken for ejected mud.  It is more probable that Plato's streams of moist
mud ([Greek words]) originated in a faint recollection of the salses (mud
volcanoes) of Agrigentum, which, as I have already mentioned, eject
argillaceous mud with a loud noise.  It is much to be regretted, in
reference to this subject, that the work of Theophrastus [Greek words] 'On
the Volcanic Stream in Sicily', to which Diog. Laert., v., 49, refers, has
not come down to us.

p 238 The different volcanoes over the earth's surface, when they are considered independently
of all climatic differences, are acutely and characteristically classified as central and linear
volcanoes.  Under the first name are comprised those which constitute the central point of
many active mouths of eruption, distributed almost regularly in all directions; under the second,
those lying at some little distance from one another, forming, as it were, chimneys or vents
along an extended fissure.  Linear volcanoes again admit of further subdivision, namely, those
which rise like separate conical islands from the bottom of the sea, being generally parallel
with a chain of primitive mountains, whose foot they appear to indicate, and those volcanic
chains which are elevated on the highest ridges of these mountain chains, of which they form
the summits.*

[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, 'Physikal. Beschreib. der Canarischen Inseln', s. 326-407. 
I doubt if we can agree with the ingenious Charles Darwin ('Geological Observations on Volcanic
Islands', 1844, p. 127) in regarding central volcanoes in general as volcanic chains of small
extent on parallel fissures.  Friedrich Hoffman believes that in the group of the Lipari Islands,
which he has so admirably described, and in which two eruption fissures intersect near Panaria,
he has found an intermediate link between the two principal modes in which volcanoes appear,
namely, the central volcanoes and volcanic chains of Von Buch (Poggendorf, 'Annalen der Physik',
bd. xxvi., s. 81-88).

The Peak of Teneriffe, for instance, is a central volcano, being the central point of the volcanic
group to which the eruption of Palma and Landerote may be referred.  The long, rampart-like
chain of the Andes, which is sometimes single, and sometimes divided into two or three parallel
branches, connected by various transverse ridges, presents, from the south of Chili to the
northwest coast of America, one of the grandest instances of a continental volcanic chain.
The proxiimity of p 239 active volcanoes is always manifested in the chain of the Andes by
the appearance of certain rocks (as dolerite, melaphyre, trachyte, andesite, and dioritic porphyry),
which divide the so-called primitive rocks, the transition slates and sandstones, and the stratified
formations.  the constant recurrence of this phenomenon convinced me long since that these
sporadic rocks were the seat of volcanic phenomena, and were connected with volcanic eruptions.
At the foot of the grand Tunguragua, near Penipe, on the banks of the Rio Puela, I first distinctly
observed mica slate resting on granite, broken through by a volcanic rock.

In the volcanic chain of the New Continent, the separate volcanoes are occasionally, when near
together in mutual dependence upon one another; and it is even seen that the volcanic activity
for centuries together has moved on in one and the same direction, as for instance, from north
to south in the province of Quito.*

[footnote]  (Humboldt, 'Geognost. Beobach, uber die Vulkane des Hochlandes von Quito', in Poggend.,
'Annal. der Physik', bd. xliv., s. 194.

The focus of the volcanic action lies below the whole of the highlands of
this province; the only channels of communication with the atmosphere are,
however, those mountains which we designate by special names, as the
mountains of Pichincha, Cotopaxi, and Tunguragua, and which, from their
grouping, elevation, and form, constitute the grandest and most picturesque
spectacle to be found in any volcanic district of an equally limited extent.
 Experience shows us, in many instances, that the extremities of such groups
of volcanic chains are connected together by subterranean communications;
and this fact reminds us of the ancient and true expression made use of by
Seneca,* that the igneous mountain is only the issue of the more
deeply-seated volcanic forces.

[footnote]  *Seneca, while he speaks very clearly regarding the problematical sinking of Aetna,
says in his 79th letter, "Though this might happen, not because the mountain's height is lowered,
but because the fires are weakened, and do not blaze out with their former vehemence; and for
which reason it is that such vast clouds of smoke are not seen in the day-time.  Yet neither
of these seem incredible, for the mountain may possibly be consumed by being daily devoured,
and the fire not be so large as formerly, since it is not self-generated here, but is kindled
in the distant bowels of the earth, and there rages, being fed with continual fuel, not with
that of the mountain, through which it only makes its passage." The subterranean communication,
"by galleries," between the volcanoes of Sicily, Lipari, Pithecusa (Ischia), and Vesuvius,
"of the last of which we may conjecture that it formerly burned and presented a fiery circle,"
seems fully understood by Strabl (lib. i., p. 247 and 248).  He terms the whole district "sub-igneous."

In the Mexican highlands a mutual dependence is p 240 also observed to exist among the volcanic
mountains Orizaba, Popocatepel, Jorullo, and Colima; and I have shown* that they all lie in
one direction between 18 degrees 59' and 19 degrees 12' north latitude, and are situated in
a transverse fissure running from sea to sea.

The volcano of Jorullo broke forth on the 29th of September, 1759, exactly in this direction,
and over the same transverse fissure, being elevated to a height of 1604 feet above the level
of the surrounding plain.  The mountain only once emitted an eruption of lava, in the same
manner as is recorded of Mount Epomeo in Ischia, in the year 1302.  But although Jorullo, which
is eighty miles from any active volcano, is in the strict sense of the word a new mountain,
it must not be compared with Monte Nuovo, near Puzzuolo, which first appeared on the 19th of
September, 1538, and is rather to be classed among craters of elevation.  I believe that I
have furnished a more natural explanation of the eruption of the Mexican volcano, in comparing
its appearance to the elevation of the Hill of Methone, now Methana, in the peninsula of Troezene.
The description given by Strabo and Pausanias of this elevation, led one of the Roman poets,
most celebrated for his richness of fancy, to develop views which agree in a remarkable manner
with the theory of modern geognosy.  "Near Troezene is a tumulus, steep and devoid of trees,
once a plain, now a mountain.  The vapors inclosed in dark caverns in vain seek a passage by
which they may escape.  The heavier earth, inflated by the force of the compressed vapors,
expands like a bladder filled with air, or like a goat-skin.  The ground has remained thus
inflated, and the high projecting eminence has been solidified by time into a naked rock."
Thus picturesquely, and, as analogous phenomena justify us in believing, thus truly has Ovid
described that great natural phenomenon which occurred 282 years before our era, and consequently,
45 years bfore the volcanic separation of Thera (Santorino) and Therasia, between Troezene
and Epidaurus, on the same spot where Russegger has found veins of trachyte.*

[footnote]  *Ovid's description of the eruption of Methone ('Metam.', xv.,
p. 226-306):
"Near Troezene stands a hill, exposed in air
To winter winds, of leafy shadows bare:
This once was level ground; but (strange to tell)
Th' included vapors, that in caverns dwell,
Laboring with colic pangs, and close confined,
In vain sought issue for the rumbling wind:
Yet still they heaved for vent, and heaving still,
Enlarged the concave and shot up the hill,
As breath extends a bladder, or the skins
Of goats are blown t'inclose the hoarded wines;
The mountain yet retains a mountain's face,
And gathered rubbish heads the hollow space."
                 'Dryden's Translation'.
[footnote continues]
This description of a dome-shaped elevation on the continent is of great
importance in a geognostical point of view, and coincides to a remarkable
degree with Aristotle's account ('Meteor.', ii., 89, 17-19) of the upheaval
of islands of eruption:  "The heaving of the earth does not cease till the
wind [(Greek word)] which occasions the shocks has made its escape into the
crust of the earth.  It is not long ago since this actually happened at
Heraclea in Pontus, and a similar event formerly occurred at Hiera, one of
the Aeolian Islands.  A portion of the earth swelled up, and with loud noise
rose into the form of a hill, till the mighty urging blast [(Greek word)]
found an outlet, and ejected sparks and ashes which covered the neighborhood
of Lipari, and even extended to several Italian cities."  In this
description, the vesicular distension of the earth's crust (a stage at which
many trachytic mountains have remained) is very well distinguished from the
eruption itself.  Strabo, lib. i., p. 59 (Casaubon), likewise describes the
phenomenon as it occurred at Methone:  near the town, in the Bay of
Hermione, there arose a flaming eruption; a fiery mountain, seven (?) stadia
in height, was then thrown up, which during the day was inaccessible from
its heat and sulphureous stench, but at night evolved an agreeable odor (?)
, and was so hot that the sea boiled for a distance of five stadia, and was
turbid for full twenty stadia, and also was filled with detached masses of
rock.  Regarding the present mineralogical character of the peninsula of
Methana, see Fiedler, 'Reise durch Griechenland', th. i., s. 257-263.

p 241 Santorino is the most important of all the 'islands of eruption' belonging to volcanic
chains.*

[footnote]  *[I am indebted to the kindness of Professor E. Forbes for the
following interesting account of the island of Santorino, and the adjacent
islands of Neokaimeni and Microkaimeni.  "The aspect of the bay is that of a
great crater filled with water, Thera and Therasia forming its walls, and
the other islands being after-productions in its center.  We sounded with
250 fathoms of line in the middle of the bay, between Therasia and the main
islands, but got no bottom.  Both these islands appear to be similarly
formed of successive strata of volcanic ashes, which, being of the most
vivid and variegated colors, present a striking contrast to the black and
cindery aspect of the central isles.  Neokaimeni, the last-formed island, is
a great heap of obsidian and scoriae.  So, also, is the greater mass,
Microkaimeni, which rises up in a conical form, and has a cavity or crater.
On one side of this island, however, a section is exposed, and cliffs of
fine pumiceous ash appear stratified in the greater islands.  In the main
island, the volcanic strata abut against the limestone mass of Mount St.
Elias in such a way as to lead to the inference that they were deposited in
a sea bottom in which the present mountain rose as a submarine mass of rock.
 The people at Santorino assured us that subterranean noises are not
unfrequently heard, especially during calms and south winds, when they say
the water of parts of the bay becomes the color of sulphur.  My own
impression is, that this group of islands, constitutes a crater of
elevation, of which the outer ones are the remains of the walls, while the
central group are of later origin, and consist partly of upheaved sea
bottoms and partly of erupted matter -- erupted, however, beneath the
surface of the water."] -- Tr.

It combines within itself p 242 the history of all islands of elevation.  For upward of 2000
years, as far as history and tradition certify, it would appear as if nature were striving
to form a volcano in the midst of the crater of elevation."*

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Physik. Beschr. der Canar. Inseln', s. 356-358, and particularly
the French translation of this excellent work, p. 402; and his memoir in Poggendorf's 'Annalen',
bd. xxxviii., s. 183.  A submarine island has quite recently made its appearance within the
crater of Santorino.  In 1810 it was still fifteen fathoms below the surface of the sea, but
in 1830 it had risen to within three or four.  It rises steeply like a great cone, from the
bottom of the sea, and the continuous activity of the submarine crater is obvious from the
circumstance that sulphurous acid vapors are mixed with the sea water, in the eastern bay of
Neokaimeni, in the same manner as at Vromolimni, near Methana.  Coppered ships lie at anchor
in the bay in order to get their bottoms cleaned and polished by this natural (volcanic) process.
(Virlet, in the 'Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France', t. iii., p. 109, and Fiedler
'Reise durch Griechenland', th. ii., s. 469 and 584.)

Similar insular elevations, and almost always at regular intervals of 80 or 90 years,* have
been manifested in the island of St. Michael, in the Azores; but in this case the bottom of
the sea has not been elevated at exactly the same parts.**

College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U. S., in his 'Description of the Island of St. Michael,
etc.', Boston, 1822, gives an interesting account of the sudden appearance of the island named
Sabrina which was about a mile in circumference, and two or three hundred feet above the level
of the ocean.  After continuing for some weeks, it sank into the sea.  Dr. Webster describes
the whole of the island of St. Michael as volcanic, and containing a number of conical hills
of trachyte, several of which have craters, and appear at some former time to have been the
openings of volcanoes.  The hot springs which abound in the island are impregnated with sulphureted
hydrogen and carbonic acid gases, appearing to attest the existence of volcanic action.] -- Tr.

The island which Captain Tillard named 'Sabrina', appeared unfortunately at a time (the 30th
of January, 1811) when the political relations of the maritime nations of Western Europe prevented
that attention being bestowed upon the subject by scientific institutions which was afterward
directed to the sudden appearance (the 2d of July, 1831), and the speedy destruction of the
igneous island of Ferdinandea in the Sicilian Sea, between the limestone shores of Sciacca
and the purely volcanic island of Pantellaria.*

p 243 The geographical distribution of the volcanoes which have been in a state of activity
during historical times, the great number of insular and littoral volcanic mountains, and the
occasional, although ephemeral, eruptions in the bottom of the sea, early led to the belief
that volcanic activity was connected with the neighborhood of the sea, and was dependent upon
it for its continuance.  "For many hundred years," says Justinian, or rather Trogus Pompeius,
whom he follows,* "Aetna and the Aeolian Islands have been burning, and how could this have
continued so long if the fire had not been fed by the p 244 neighboring sea?"**

[footnote]  *"Accedunt vicini et perpetui Aetnae montis ignes et insularum Aeolidum, veluti
ipsis undis alatur incendium; neque enim aliter durare tot seculis tantus ignis potuisset,
nisi humoris nutrimentis aleretur." (Justin, 'Hist. Philipp.', iv., i.)  The volcanic theory
with which the physical description of Sicily here begins is extremely intricate.  Deep fissured;
violent motion of the waves of the sea, which, as they strike together, draw down the air (the
wind) for the maintenance of the fire: such are the elements of the theory of Trogus.  Since
he seems from Pliny (xi., 52) to have been a physiognomist, we may presume that his numerous
lost works were not confined to history alone.  The opinion that air is forced into the interior
of the earth, there to act on the vocanic furnaces, was connected by the ancients with the
supposed influence of winds from different quarters on the intensity of the fires burning in
tna, Hiera, and Stromboli.  (See the remarkable passage in Strabo, liv. vi., Aetna.)  The mountain
island of Stromboli (Strongyle) was regarded therefore, as the dwelling-place of Aeolus, "the
regulator of the winds," in consequence of the sailors foretelling the weather from the activity
of the volcanic eruptions of this island.  Bembo, who during his youth was brought up in Sicily
by Greek refugees, gave an agreeable narrative of his wanderings, and in his 'Aetna Dialogus'
(written in the middle of the sixteenth century) advances the theory of the penetration of
sea water to the very center of the volcanic action, and of the necessity of the proximity
of the sea to active volcanoes.  In ascending Aetna the following question was proposed:  "Explaina
potius nobis quae petimus, ea incendia unde oriantur et orta quomodo perdurent.  In omni tellure
nuspiam majores fistulae aut meatus ampliores sunt quam in locis, quae vel mari vicina sunt,
vel a mari protinus alluntur:  mare erodit illa facillime pergitque in viscera terrae.  Itaque
cum in aliena regna sibi  viam faciat, ventis etiam facit; ex quo fit, ut loca quaeque maritima
maxime terrae motibus subjecta sint, parum mediterranea.  Habes quum in sulfuris venas venti
furentes inciderint, unde incendia oriantur tn tuae.  Vides, quae mare in radicibus habeat,
quae sulfurea sit, quae cavernosa, quae a mari aliquando perforata ventos admiscrit Aestuantes,
per quos idonea flammae materies incenderetur."

[footnote]  **[Although extinct volcanoes seem by no means confined to the neighborhood of
the present seas, being often scattered over the most inland portions of our existing continents,
yet it will appear that, at the time at which they were in an active state, the greater part
were in the neighborhood either of the sea, or of the extensive salt or fresh water lakes,
which existed at that period over much of what is now dry land.  This may be seen either by
referring to Dr. Boue's map of Europe, or to that published by Mr. Lyell in the recent edition
of his 'Principles of Geology' (1847), from both of which it will become apparent that, at
a comparatively recent epoch, those parts of France, of Germany, of Hungary, and of Italy,
which afford evidences of volcanic action now extinct, were covered by the ocean.  Daubeney

In order to explain the necessity of the vicinity of the sea, recourse has been had, even in
modern times, to the hypothesis of the penetration of sea water into the foci of volcanic agency,
that is to say, into deep-seated terrestrial strata.  When I collect together all the facts
that may be derived from my own observation and the laborious researches of others, it appears
to me that every thing in this great quantity of aqueous vapors, which are unquestionably exhaled
from volcanoes even when in a state of rest, be derived from sea water impregnated with salt,
or rather, perhaps with fresh meteoric water; or whether the expansive force of the vapors
(which, at a depth of nearly 94,000 feet, is equal to 2800 atmospheres) would be able at different
depths to counterbalance the hydrostatic pressure of the sea, and thus afford them, under certain
conditions, a free access to the focus;* or whether the formation of metallic chlorids, the
presence of chlorid of sodium in the fissures of the crater, and the frequent mixture of hydrochloric
acid with the aqueous vapors, necessarily imply access of sea water; or, finally, whether the
repose of volcanoes (either when temporary, or permanent and complete) depends upon the closure
of the channels by which the sea or meteoric water was conveyed, or whether the absence of
flames and of exhalations of hydrogen (and sulphureted hydrogen gas seems more characteristic
of solfataras than of active volcanoes) is not directly at variance p 245 with the hypothesis
of the decomposition of great masses of water?**

[footnote]  * Compare Gay-Lussac, 'Sur les Volcans', in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. xxii.,
p. 427, and Bischof, 'Warmelehre', s. 272.  The eruptions of smoke and steam which have at
different periods been seen in Lancerote, Iceland, and the Kurile Islands, during the eruption
of the neighboring volcanoes, afford indications of the reaction of volcanic foci through tense
columns of water; that is to say, these phenomena occur when the expansive force of the vapor
exceeds the hydrostatic pressure.

[footnote]  ** [See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', Part iii., ch. xxxvi., xxxviii., xxxix.] -- Tr.

The discussion of these important physical questions does not come within the scope of a work
of this nature; but, while we are considering these phenomena, we would enter somewhat more
into the question of the geographical distribution of still active volcanoes.  We find, for
instance, that in the New World, three, viz., Jorullo, Popocatepetl, and the volcano of De
la Fragua, are situated at the respective distances of 80, 132, and 196 miles from the sea-coast,
while in Central Asia, as Abel Remusat* first made known to geognosists, the Thianschan (Celestial
Mountains), in which are situated the lava-emitting mountain of Pe-schan, the solfatara of
Urumtsi, and the still active igneous mountain (Ho-tscheu) of Turfan, lie at an almost equal
distance (1480 to 1528 miles) from the shores of the Polar Sea and those of the Indian Ocean.

[footnote]  *Abel Remusat, 'Lettre a M. Cordier', in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. v., p. 137.

Pe-schan is also fully 1360 miles distant from the Caspian Sea,* and 172 and 218 miles from
the seas of Issikul and Balkasch.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 30-33, 38-52, 70-80, and 426-428.  The existence
of active volcanoes in Kordofan, 540 miles from the Red Sea, has been recently contradicted
by Ruppell, 'Reisen in Nubien', 1829, s. 151.

It is a fact worthy of notice, that among the four great parallel mountain chains which traverse
the Asiatic continent from east to west, the Altai, the Thianschan, the Kuen-lun, and the Himalaya,
it is not the latter chain, which is nearest to Kuen-lun, at the distance of 1600 and 720 miles
from the sea, which have fire-emitting mountains like Aetna and Vesuvius, and generate ammonia
like the volcano of Guatimala.  Chinese writers undoubtedly speak of lava streams when they
describe the emissions of smoke and flame, which, issuing from Pe-schan, devastated a space
measuring ten li* in the first and seventh centuries of our era.

[footnote]  *[A 'li' is a Chinese measurement, equal to about one thirtieth of a mile.] -- Tr.

Burning masses of stone flowed, according to their description "like thin melted fat."  The
facts that have been enumerated, and to which sufficient attention has not been bestowed, render
it probable that the vicinity of the sea, and the penetration of sea water to the foci of volcanoes,
are not absolutely necessary to the eruption of p 246 subterranean fire, and that littoral
situations only favor the eruption by forming the margin of a deep sea basin, which, covered
by strata of water, and lying many thousand feet lower than the interior continent, can offer
but an inconsiderable degree of resistance.

The present active volcanoes, which communicate by permanent craters simultaneously with the
interior of the earth and with the atmosphere, must have been formed at a subsequent period,
when the upper chalk strta and all the tertiary formations were already present:  this is shown
to be the fact by the trachytic and basaltic eruptions which frequently form the walls of the
crater of elevation.  Melaphyres extend to the middle tertiary formations, but are found already
in the Jura limestone, where they break through the variegated sandstone.*

[footnote]  *Dufrenoy et Elie de Beaumont, 'Explication de la Carte Geologique de la France',
t. i., p. 89.

We must not confound the earlier outpourings of granite, quartzose porphyry, and euphotide
from temporary fissures in the old transition rocks with the present active volcanic craters.

The extinction of volcanic activity is either only partial -- in which case the subterranean
fire seeks another passage of escape in the same mountain chain -- or it is total, as in Auvergne.
More recent examples are recorded in historical times, of the total extinction of the volcano
of Mosychlos,* on the island sacred to Hephaestos (Vulcan), whose "high whirling flames" were
known to Sophocles; and of the volcano of Medina, which according to Burckhardt, still continued
to pour out a stream of lava on the 2d of November, 1276.

[footnote]  *Sophocl., 'Philoct.', v. 971 and 972.  On the supposed epoch of the extinction
of the Lemnian fire in the time of Alexander, compare Buttmann, in the 'Museum der Alterhumswissenschaft',
bd. i., 1807, s. 295; Dureau de la Malle, in Malte-Brun, 'Annales des Voyages', t. ix., 1809,
p. 5; Ukert in Bertuch, 'Geogr. Ephemeriden', bd. xxxix., 1812, s. 361; Rhode, 'Res Lemnicae',
1829, p. 8; and Walter, 'Ueber Abnahame der Vulken. Thatigkeit in Historischen Zeiten', 1844,
s. 24.  The chart of Lemmos, constructed by Choiseul, makes it extremely probable that the
extinct crater of Mosychlos, and the island of Chryse, the desert habitation of Philoctetes
(Otfried Muller, 'Minyer', s. 300), have been long swallowed up by the sea. Reefs and shoals,
to the northeast of Lemnos, still indicate the spot where the Aegean Sea once possessed an
active volcano like Aetna, Vesuvius, Stromboli, and Volcano (in the Lipari Isles).

Every stage of volcanic activity, from its first origin to its extinction, is characterized
by peculiar products; first by ignited scoriae, streams of lava consisting of trachyte, pyroxene,
and obsidian, and by rapilli and tufaceous ashes, accompanied by the development p 247 of large
quantities of pure aqueous vapor; subsequently, when the volcano becomes a solfatara, by aqueous
vapors mixed with sulphureted hydrogen and carbonic acid gases; and, finally, when it is completely
cooled, by exhalations of carbonic acid alone.  There is a remarkable class of igneous mountains
which do not eject lava, but merely devastating streams of hot water,* impregnated with burning
sulphur and rocks reduced to a state of dust (as, for instance, the Galungung in Java); but
whether these mountains present a normal condition, or only a certain transitory modification
of the volcanic process, must remain undecided until they are visited by geologists possessed
of a knowledge of chemistry in its present condition.

[footnote]  *Compare Reinwardt and Hoffmann, in Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xii., s. 607; Leop.
von Buch, 'Descr. des Iles Canaries', p. 424-426.  The eruptions of argillaceous mud at Carguairazo,
when that volcano was destroyed in 1698, the Lodazales of Igualata, and the Moya of Pelileo
-- all on the table-land of Quito -- are volcanic phenomena of a similar nature.

I have endeavored in the above remarks to furnish a general description of volcanoes -- comprising
one of the most important sections of the history of terrestrial activity -- and I have based
my statements partly on my own observations, but more in their general bearing on the results
yielded by the labors of my old friend, Leopold von Buch, the greatest geognosist of our own
age, and the first who recognized the intimate connection of volcanic phenomena, and their
mutual dependence upon one another, considered with reference to their relations in space.

Volcanic action, or the reaction of the interior of a planet on its external crust and surface,
was long regarded only as an isolated phenomenon, and was considered solely with respect to
the disturbing action of the subterranean force; and it is only in recent times that -- greatly
to the advantage of geognostical views based on physical analogies -- volcanic forces have
been regarded as 'forming new rocks, and transforming those that already existed'.  We here
arrive at the point to which I have already alluded, at which a well-grounded study of the
activity of volcanoes, whether igneous or merely such as emit gaseous exhalations, leads us,
on the one hand, to the mineralogical branch of geognosy (the science of the texture and the
succession of terrestrial strata), and, on the other, to the science of geographical forms
and outlines -- the configuration of continents and insular groups elevated above the level
p 248 of the sea.  This extended insight into the connection of natural phenomena is the result
of the philosophical direction which has been so generally assumed by the more earnest study
of geognosy.  Increased cultivation of science and enlargement of political views alike tend
to unite elements that had long been divided.

'Rocks of eruption', which have issued from the interior of the earth either in a state of
fusion from volcanic action, or in a more or less soft, viscous condition, from Plutonic action.

'Sedimentary rocks', which have been precipitated and deposited on the earth's surface from
a fluid, in which the most minute particles were either dissolved or held in suspension constituting
the greater part of the secondary (or flotz) and tertiary groups.

'Transformed or metamorphic rocks',* in which the internal texture and the mode of stratification
have been changed, either p 249 by contact or proximity with a Plutonic or volcanic endogenous
rock of eruption,** or, what is more frequently the case, by a gaseous sublimation of substances***
which accompany certain masses erupted in a hot, fluid condition.

[footnote] *[As the doctrine of mineral metamorphism is now exciting very general attention,
we subjoin a few explanatory observations by the 'New Philos. Journ.', Jan., 1848:  "In its
widest sense, mineral metamorphism means every change of aggregation, structure, or chemical
condition which rocks have undergone subsequently to their deposition and stratification, or
the effects which have been produced by other forces than gravity and cohesion.  There fall
under this definition, the discoloration of the surface of black limestone by the loss of carbon;
the formation of brownish-red crusts on rocks of limestone, sandstone, many slate structures,
serpentine, granite, etc., by the decomposition of iton pyrites, or magnetic iron, finely disseminated
in the mass of the rock; the conversion of anhydrite into gypsum, in consequence of the absorption
of water; the crumbling of many granites and porphyries into gravel, occasioned by the decomposition
of the mica and feldspar.  In its more limited sense, the term metamorphic is confined to those
changes of the rock which are produced, not by the effect of the atmosphere or of water on
the exposed surfaces, but which are produced, directly or indirectly, by agencies seated in
the interior of the earth.  In many cases the mode of change may be explained by our physical
or chemical theories, and may be viewed as the effect of temperature or of electro-chemical
actions.  Adjoining rocks, or connecting communications with the interior of the earth, also
distinctly point out the seat from which the change proceeds. In many other cases the metamorphic
process itself remains a mystery, and from the nature of the products alone do we conclude
that such a metamorphic action has taken place.] -- Tr.

[footnote]  ** In a plan of the neighborhood of Tezcuco, Totonilco, and Moran ('Atlas Geographique
et Physique', pl. vii.), which I originally (1803) intended for a work which I never published,
entitled 'Pasigrafia Geognostica destinada al uso de los Jovenes del Colegio de Mineria de
Mexico', I names (in 1832) the Plutonic and volcanic eruptive rocks 'endogenous' (generated
in the interior), and the sedimentary and flotz rocks 'exogenous' (or generated externally
on the surface of the earth). Pasiward, [upward arrow] and the latter by the same symbol directed
downward [downward arrow].  These signs have at least some advantage over the ascending lines,
which in the older systems represent arbitrarily and ungracefully the horizontally ranged sedimentary
strata, and their penetration through masses of basalt, porphyry, and syenite.  The names proposed
in the pasigraphico-geognostic plan were borrowed from De Candolle's nomenclature, in which
'endogenous' is synonymous with monocotyledonous, and 'exogenous' with dicotyledonous plants.
Mohl's more accurate examination of vegetable tissues has, however, shown that the growth of
monocotyledons from within, and dicotyledons from without, is not strictly and generally true
for vegetable organisms (Link, 'Elementa Philosophiae Botanicae', t. i., 1837, p. 287; Endlicher
and Unger, 'Grundzugeder Botanik', 1843, s. 89; and Jussieu, 'Traite de Botanique', t. i.,
p. 85).  The rocks which I have termed endogenous are characteristically distinguished by Lyell,
in his 'Principles of Geology', 1833, vol. iii., p. 374, as "nether-formed" or "hypogene rocks."

[footnote] *** Compare Leop. von Buch, 'Ueber Dolomit als Gebirgsart', 1823, s. 36; and his
remarks on the degree of fluidity to be ascribed to Plutonic rocks at the period of their eruption,
as well as on the formation of gneiss from schist, through the action of granite and of the
substances upheaved with it, to be found in the 'Abhandl. der Akad. der Wissensch. zu Berlin'
for the year 1842, s. 58 und 63, and in the 'Jahrbuch fur Wissenschaftliche Kritik', 1840, s. 195.

'Conglomerates'; coarse or finely granular sandstones, or breccias composed of mechanically-divided
masses of the three previous species.

These four modes of formation -- by the emission of volcanic masses, as narrow lava streams;
by the action of these masses on rocks previously hardened; by mechanical separation or chemical
precipitation from liquids impregnated with carbonic acid; and, finally, by the cementation
of disintegrated rocks of heterogeneous nature -- are phenomena and formative processes which
must merely be regarded as a faint reflection of that more energetic activity which must have
characterized the chaotic condition of the earlier world under wholly different conditions
of pressure and at a higher temperature, not only in the whole crust of the earth, but likewise
in the more p 250 extended atmosphere, overloaded with vapors.  The vast fissures which were
formerly open in the solid crust of the earth have since been filled up or closed by the protrusion
of elevated mountain chains, or by the penetration of veins of rocks of eruption (granite,
porphyry, basalt, and melaphyre); and while, scarcely more than four volcanoes remaining through
which fire and stones are erupted, the thinner, more fissured, and unstable crust of the earth
was anciently almost every where covered by channels of communication between the fused interior
and the external atmosphere. Gaseous emanations rising from very unequal depths, and therefore
conveying substances differing in their chemical nature, imparted greater activity to the Plutonic
processes of formation and transformation.  The sedimentary formations, the deposits of liquid
fluids from cold and hot springs, which we daily see producing the travertine strata near Rome,
and near Hobart Town in Van Diemen's Land, afford but a faint idea of the flotz formation.
In our seas, small banks of limestone, almost equal in hardness at some parts to Carrara marble,*
are in the course of formation, by gradual precipitation, accumulation, and cementation --
processes whose mode of action has not been sufficiently well investigated.

[footnote]  Darwin, 'Volcanic Islands', 1844, p. 49 and 154.

The Sicilian coast, the island of Ascension, and King George's Sound in Australia, are instances
of this mode of formation.  On the coasts of the Antilles, these formations of the present
ocean contain articles of pottery, and other objects of human industry, and in Guadaloupe even
human skeletons of the Carib tribes.*

[footnote]  *[In most instances the bones are dispersed; but a large slab of rock, in which
considerable portion of the skeleton of a female is embedded, is preserved in the British Museum.
The presence of these bones has been explained by the circumstance of a battle, and the massacre
of a tribe of Gallibis by the Caribs, which took place near the spot in which they are found,
about 120 years ago; for, as the bodies of the slain were interred on the sea-shore, their
skeletons may have been subsequently covered by sand-drift, which has since consolidated into
limestone.  Dr. Moultrie, of the Medical College, Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., is, however,
of opinion that these bones did not belong to individuals of the Carib tribe, but of the Peruvian
race, or of a tribe possessing a similar craniological development.] --Tr.

A small colitic bed, formed in Lancerote, one of the Canary Islands, and which, notwithstanding
p 251 its recent formation, bears a resemblance to Jura Limestone, has been recognized as a
product of the sea and of tempests.*

[footnote]  *Near Teguiza.  Leop. von Buch, 'Canarische Inseln', s. 301.

Composite rocks are definite associations of certain crytonostic, simple minerals, as feldspar,
mica, solid silex, augite, and nepheline.  Rocks very similar to these consisting of the same
elements, but grouped differently, are still formed by volcanic processes, as in the earlier
periods of the world.  The character of rocks, as we have already remarked is so independent
of geographical relations of space,* that the geologist recognizes with surprise, alike to
the north or the south of the equator, in the remotest and most dissimilar zones, the familiar
aspect, and the repetition of even the most minute characteristics in the periodic stratification
of the silurian strata, and in the effects of contact with augitic masses of eruption.

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, op. cit., p. 9.

We will now enter more fully into the consideration of the four modes in which rocks are formed
-- the four phases of their formative processes manifested in the stratified and unstratified
portions of the earth's surface; thus, in the 'endogenous' or 'erupted rocks', designated by
modern geognosists as compact and abnormal rocks, we may enumerate the following principal
groups as immediate products of terrestrial activity:

1.  'Granite and syenite' of very different respective ages; the granite is frequently the
more recent,* traversing the syenite in veins, and being, in that case, the active upheaving
agent.  "Where the granite occurs in large, insulated masses of a faintly-arched, ellipsoidal
form, it is covered by a crust of shell cleft into blocks, instances of which are met with
alike in the Hartz district, in Mysore, and in Lower Peru.

[footnote]  *Bernhard Cotta, 'Geognosie', 1839, s. 273.

This surface of the granite, owing to the great expansion that accompanied its first upheaval."*

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Ueber Granit and Gneiss', in the 'Abhandl. der Berl. Akad.' for
the year 1842, s. 60.

Both in Northern Asia,* on the charming and romantic shores of the Lake of Kolivan, on the
northwest declivity of p. 252 the Altai Mountains, and at Las Trincheras, on the slop of the
littoral chain of Caraccas,** I have seen granite divided into ledges, owing probably to a
similar contraction, although the divisions appeared to penetrate far into the interior.

[footnote] *  In the projecting mural masses of granite of Lake Kolivan, divided into narrow
parallel beds, there are numerous crystals of feldspar and albite, and a few of titanium (Humboldt,
'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 295, Gustav Rose, 'Reise mach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 524).

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Relation Historique', t. ii., p. 99

Further to the south of Lake Kolivan, toward the boundaries of the Chinese province Ili (between
Buchtarminsk and the River Narym), the formation of the erupted rock, in which there is no
gneiss, is more remarkable than I ever observed in any other part of the earth.  The granite,
which is always covered with scales and characterized by tabular divisions, rises in the steppes,
either in small hemispherical eminences, scarcely six or eight feet in height, or like basalt,
in mounds, terminating on either side of their bases in narrow streams.*

[footnote]  ** See the sketch of Biri-tau, which I took from the south side, where the Kirghis
tents stood, and which is given in Rose's 'Reise', bd. i., s. 584.  On spheres of granite scaling
off concentrically, see my 'Relat. Hist.', t. ii., p. 497, and 'Essai Geogn. sur les Gisement
des Roches', p. 78.

At the cataracts of the Orinoco, as well as in the district of the Fichtelgebirge (Seissen),
in Galicia, and between the Pacific and the highlands of Mexico (on the Papagallo), I have
seen granite in large, flattened spherical masses, which could be divided, like basalt, into
concentric layers.  In the valley of Irtysch, between Buchtarminsk and Ustkamenogorsk, granite
covers transition slate for a space of four miles,* penetrating into it from above in narrow,
variously ramified, wedge-like veins.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 299-311, and the drawings in Rose's 'Reise',
bd. i., s. 611, in which we see the curvature in the layers of granite which Leop. von Buch
has pointed out as chracteristic.

I have only instanced these peculiarities in order to designate the individual character of
one of the most generally diffused erupted-rocks. As granite is superposed on slate in Siberia
and in the Departement de Finisterre (Isle de Mihau), so it covers the Jura limestone in the
mountains of Oisons (Fermonts), and syenite, and indirectly also chalk, in Saxony, near Weinbohla.*

[footnote]  *This remarkable superposition was first described by Weiss in Krsten's 'Archiv
fur Bergbau und H¬ttenwesen', bd. xvi., 1827, s. 5.

Near Mursinsk, in the Uralian district, granite is of a drusous character, and here the pores,
like the fissures and cavities of recent volcanic products, inclose many kinds of magnificent
crystals, especially beryls and topazes.

2.  'Quartzose porphyry' is often found in the relation of veins to other rocks.  The base
is generally a finely granular mixture of the same elements which occur in the larger imbedded
p 253 crystals.  In granitic porphyry that is very poor in quartz, the feldspathic base is
almost granular and laminated.*

[footnote]  *Dufrenoy et Elie de Beaumont, 'Geologie de la France', t. i., p. 130.

3.  'Greenstones, Diorite', are granular mixtures of white albite and blackish-green hornblende,
forming dioritic porphyry when the crystals are deposited in a base of denser tissue.  The
greenstones, either pure, or inclosing laminae of diallage (as in the Fichtelgebirge), and
passing into serpentine, have sometimes penetrated, in the form of strata, into the old stratified
fissures of green argillaceous slate, but they more frequently traverse the rocks in veins,
or appear as globular masses of greenstone, similar to domes of basalt and porphyry.*

[footnote]  *These intercalated beds of diorite play an important part in the mountain district
of Nailau, near Steben, where I was engaged in mining operations in the last century, and with
which the happiest associations of my early life are connected.  Compare Hoffmann, in Poggendorf's
'Annalen', bd. xvi., s. 558.

'Hypersthene rock' is a granular mixture of labradorite and hypersthene.

'Euphotide' and serpentine, containing sometimes crystald of augite and uralite instead of
diallage, are thus nearly allied to another more frequent, and I might almost say, more 'energetic'
eruptive rock -- augitic porphyry.*

[footnote]  *In the southern and Bashkirian portion of the Ural.  Rose, 'Reise', bd. ii., s. 171.

'Melaphyre', augitic, uralitic, and oligoklastic porphyries.  To the last-named species belongs
the genuine 'verd-antique', so celebrated in the arts.

'Basalt', containing olivine and constituents which gelatinize in acids; phonolithe (porphyritic
slate), trachyte, and colerite; the first of these rocks is only paartially, and the second
always, divided into thin laminae, which give them an appearance of stratification when extended
over a large space.  Mesotype and nepheline constitute, according to Girard, an important part
in the composition and internal texture of basalt.  The nepheline contained in basalt reminds
the geognosist both of the miascite of the Ilmen Mountains in the Ural,* which has been confounded
with granite, and sometimes contains zirconium, and of the pyroxenic nepheline discovered by
Gumprecht near Lobau and Chemnitz.

[footnote]  *G. Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. ii., s. 47-52.  Respecting the identity of
eleolite and uepheline (the latter containing rather the more lime), see Scheerer, in Poggend.,
'Annalen', bd. xlix., s. 359-381.

To the second or sedimentary rocks belong the greater part of the formations which have been
comprised under the old p 254 systematic, but not very correct designation of 'transition,
flot' or 'secondary', and 'tertiary formations'.  If the erupted rocks had not exercised an
elevating, and, owing to the simultaneous shock of the earth, a disturbing influence on these
sedimentary formations, the surface of our planet would have consisted of strata arranged in
a uniformly horizontal direction above one another.  Deprived of mountain chains, on whose
declivities the gradations of vegetable forms and the scale of the diminishing heat of the
atmosphere appear to be picturesquely reflected -- furrowed ony here and there by valleys of
erosion, formed by the force of fresh water moving on in gentle undulations, or by the accumulation
of detritus, resulting from the action of currents of water -- continents would have presented
no other appearance from pole to pole than the dreary uniformity of the llanos of South America
or the steppes of Northern Asia. The vault of heaven would everywhere have appeared to rest
on vast plains, and the stars to rise as if they emerged from the depths of ocean.  Such a
condition of things could not, however, have generally prevailed for any length of time in
the earlier periods of the world, since subterranean forces must have striven in all epochs
to exert a counteracting influence.

Sedimentary strta have been either precipitated or deposited from liquids, according as the
materials entering into their composition are supposed, whether as limestone or argillaceous
slate, to be either chemically dissolved or suspended and commingled.  But earth, when dissolved
in fluids impregnated with carbonic acid, must be regarded as undergoing a mechanical process
while they are being precipitated, deposited, and accumulated into strata.  This view is of
some importance with respect to the envelopment of organic bodies in petrifying calcareous
beds.  The most ancient sediments of the transition and secondary formations have probably
been formed from water at a more or less high temperature, and at a time when the heat of the
upper surface of the earth was still very considerable.  Considered in this point of view,
a Plutonic action seems to a certain extent also to have taken place in the sedimentary strata,
especially the more ancient; but these strata appear to have been hardened into a schistose
structure, and under great pressure, and not to have been solidified by cooling, like the rocks
that have issued from the interior, as, for instance, granite, porphyry, and basalt.  By degrees,
as the waters lost their temperature, and were able to absorb a copious supply of the carbonic
acid gas with which p 255 the atmosphere was overcharged, they became fitted to hold in solution
a larger quantity of lime.

'The sedimentary strata', setting aside all other exogenous, purely mechanical deposits of
sand or detritus, are as follows:

'Schist', of the lower and upper transition rock, compositing the silurian and devonian formations;
from the lower silurian strata, which were once termed cambrian, to the upper strata of the
old red sandstone or devonian formation, immediately in contact with the mountain limestone.

'Carboniferous deposits':

'Limestones' imbedded in the transition and carboniferous formations; zechstein, muschelkalk,
Jura formation and chalk, also that portion of the tertiary formation which is not included
in sandstone and conflomerate.

'Travertine', fresh-water limestone, and silicious concretions of hot springs, formations which
have not been produced under the pressure of a large body of sea water, but almost in immediate
contact with the atmosphere, as in shallow marshes and streams.

'Infusorial deposits':  geognostical phenomena, whose great importance in proving the influence
of organic activity in the formation of the solid part of the earth's crust was first discovered
at a recent period by my highly-gifted friend and fellow-traveler, Ehrenberg.

If, in this short and superficial view of the mineral constituents of the earth's crust, I
do not place immediately after the simple sedimentary rocks the conglomerates and sandstone
formations which have also been deposited as sedimentary strata from liquids, and which have
been imbedded alternately with schist and limestone, it is only because they contain, together
with the detritus of eruptive and sedimentary rocks, also the detritus of gneiss, mica slate,
and other metamorphic masses.  The obscure process of this metamorphism, and the action if
produces, must therefore compose the third class of the fundamental forms of rock.

Endogenous or erupted rocks (granite, porphyry, and melaphyre) produce, as I have already frequently
remarked, not only cynamical, shaking, upheaving actions, either vertically or laterally displacing
the strata, but they also occasion changes in their chemical composition as well as in the
nature of their internal structure; new rocks being thus formed, as gneiss, mica slate, and
granular limestone (Carrara and Parian marble).  The old silurian or devonian transition schists,
the belemnitic limestone of Tarantaise, and the dull gray calcareous p 256 sandstone ('Macigno'),
which contains alggae found in the northern Apennines, often assume a new and more brilliant
appearance after their metamorphosis, which renders it difficult to recognize them.  The theory
of metamorphism was not established until the individual phases of the change were followed
step by step, and direct chemical experiments on the difference in the fusion point, in the
pressure and time of cooling, were brought in aid of mere inductive conclusions.  Where the
study of chemical combinations is regulated by leading ideas,* it may be the means of throwing
a clear light on the wide field of geognosy, and over the vast laboratory of nature in which
rocks are continually being formed and modified by the agency of subterranean forces.

for the years 1822 and 1823, s. 25-41; and in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. x., s. 137-152; bd.

The philosopohical inquirer will escape the deception of apparent analogies, and the danger
of being led astray by a narrow view of natural phenomena, if he constantly bear in view the
complicated conditions which may, by the intensity of their force, have modified the counteracting
effect of those individual substances whose nature is better known to us.  Simple bodies have,
no doubt, at all periods, obeyed the same laws of attraction, and, wherever apparent contradictions
present themselves, I am confident that chemistry will in most cases be able to trace the cause
to some corresponding error in the experiment.

Observations made with extreme accuracy over large tracts of land, show that
erupted rocks have not been produced in an irregular and unsystematic
manner.  In parts of the globe most remote from one another, we often find
that granite, basalt, and diorite have exercised a regular and uniform
metamorphic action, even in the minutest details, on the strata of
argillaceous slate, dense limestone, and the grains of quartz in sandstones.
 As the same endogenous rock manifests almost every where the same degree of
activity, so on the contrary, different rocks belonging to the same class,
whether to the endogenous or the  erupted, exhibit great differences in
their character.  Intense heat has undoubtedly influenced all these
phenomena, but the degree of fluidity (the more or less perfect mobility of
the particles -- their more viscous composition) has varied very
considerably from the granite to the basalt, while at different geological
p 257
periods (or metamorphic phases of the earth's crust) other substances
dissolved in vapors have issued from the interior of the earth
simultaneously with the eruption of granite, basalt, greenstone porphyry,
and serpentine.  This seems a fitting place again to draw attention to the
fact that, according to the admirable views of modern geognosy, the
metamorphism of rocks is not a mere phenomenon of contact, limited to the
effect produced by the apposition of two rocks, since it comprehends all the
generic phenomena that have accompanied the appearance of a particular
erupted mass.  Even where there is no immediate contact, the proximity of
such a mass gives rise to modifications of solidification, cohesion,
granulation, and crystallization.

All eruptive rocks penetrate, as ramifying veins either into the sedimentary strata, or into
other equally endogenous masses; but there is a special importance to be attached to the difference
manifested between 'Plutonic' rocks* (granite, porphyry, and serpentine) and those termed 'volcanic'
in the strict sense of the word (as trachyte, basalt, and lava).

[footnote]  ([Lyell, 'Principales of Geology', vol. i.i., p. 353 and 359.] -- Tr.

The rocks produced by the activity of our present volcanoes appear as band-like streams, but
by the confluence of several of them they may form an extended basin.  Wherever it has been
possible to trace basaltic eruptions, they have generally been found to terminate in slender
threads.  Examples of these narrow openings may be found in three places in Germany:  in the
'Pflaster-kaute', at Marksuhl, eight miles from Eisenach; in the blue 'Kuppe', near Eschwege,
on the banks of the Werra; and in the Druidical stone on the Hollert road (Siegen), where the
basalt has broken through the variegated sandstone and graywacke slate, and has spread itself
into cup-like fungoid enlargements, which are either grouped together like rows of columns,
or are sometimes stratified in thin laminae.  The case is otherwise with granite, syenite,
quartzose porphyry, serpentine, and the whole series of unstratified compact rocks, to which,
from a predilection for a mythological nomenclature, the term Plutonic has been applied.  These,
with the exception of occasional veins, were probably not erupted in a state of fusion, but
merely in a softened condition; not from narrow fissures, but from long and widely-extending
gorges.  They have been protruded, but have not flowed forth, and are found not in streams
like lava, but in extended masses.*

[footnote]  *The description here given of the relation of position under which granite occurs,
expresses the general or leading character of the whole formation.  But its aspect at some
places leads to the belief that it was occasionally more fluid at the period of its eruption.
The description given by Rose, in his 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 599, of part of the
Narym chain, near the frontiers of the Chinese territories, as well as the evidence afforded
by trachyte, as described by Dufrenoy and Elie de Beaumont, in their 'Description Geologique
de la France', t. i., p. 70. Having already spoken in the text of the narrow apertures through
which the basalts have sometimes been effused, I will here notice the large fissures, which
have acted as conducting passages for melaphyres, which must not be confounded with basalts.
See Murchison's interesting account ('The Silurian System', p. 126) of a fissure 480 feet wide,
through which melaphyre has been ejected, at the coal-mine at Cornbrook, Hoar Edge.

Some groups of dolerite and trachyte indicate p 258 a certain degree of basaltic fluidity;
others, which have been expanded into vast craterless domes, appear to have been only in a
softened condition at the time of their elevation.  Other trachytes, like those of the Andes,
in which I have frequently perceived a striking analogy with the greenstones and syenitic porphyries
(which are argentiferous, and without quartz), are deposited in the same manner as granite
and quartzose porphyry.

Experiments on the changes which the texture and chemical constitution of rocks experience
from the action of heat, have shown that volcanic masses* (diorite, augitic porphyry, basalt,
and the lava of AEtna) yield different products, according to the difference of the pressure
under which they have been fused, and the length of time occupied during their cooling; thus,
where the cooling was rapid, they form a black glass, having a homogeneous fracture, and where
the cooling was slow, a stony mass of granular crystalline structure.

[footnote]  *Sir James Hall, in the 'Edin. Trans.', vol. v., p. 43, and vol. vi., p. 71; Gregory
Watt, in the 'Phil. Trans. of the Roy. Soc. of London for' 1804, Part ii., p. 279; Dartigues
and Fleurieu de Bellevue, in the 'Journal de Physique', t. lx., p. 456; Bischof, 'Warmelchre',
s. 313 und 443.

In the latter case, the crystals are formed partly in cavities and partly inclosed in the matrix.
The same materials yield the most dissimilar products, a fact that is of the greatest importance
in reference to the study of the nature of erupted rocks, and of the metamorphic action which
they occasion.  Carbonate of lime, when fused under great pressure, does not lose its carbonic
acid, but becomes, when cooled, granular limestone; when the crystallization has been effected
by the dry method, saccharoidal marble; while by the humid method, calcareous spar and aragonite
and produced, the former under a lesser degree of temperature than the latter.*

[footnote]  *Gustav Rose, in Poggend., 'Annalen.' bd. xliii., s 364.

Differences of temperature p 259 likewise modify the direction in which the different particles
arrange themselves in the act of crystallization, and also affect the form of the crystal.*

[footnote]  *On the dimorphism of sulphur, see Mitscherlich, 'Lehrbuch der Chemie', 55-63.

Even when a body is not in a fluid condition, the smallest particles may undergo certain relations
in their various modes of arrangement, which are manifested by the different action on light.*

[footnote]  *On gypsum as a uniaxal crystal, and on the sulphate of magnesia, and the oxyds
of zinc and nickel, see Mitscherlich, in Poggend., 'Annalen.' bd. xi., s. 328.

The phenomena presented by devitrification, and by the formation of steel by cementation and
casting -- the transition of the fibrous in the granular tissue of the iron, from the action
of heat* and probably, also, by regular and long-continued concussions -- likewise throw a
considerable degree of light on the geological process of metamorphism.

[footnote]  *Coste, 'Versuche am Creusot uber das bruchig werden des Stabeisens.'  Elie de
Beaumont, 'Mem. Geol.', t. ii., p. 411.

Heat may even simultaneously induce opposite actions in crystalline bodies; for the admirable
experiments of Mitscherlich have established the fact* that calcareous spar, without altering
its condition of aggregation, expands in the direction of one of its axes and contracts in
the other.

[footnote]  * Mitscherlich, 'Ueber die Ausdehnung der Krystallisirten Korper durch die Warmelehre',
in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. x., s. 151.

If we pass from these general considerations to individual examples, we find that schist is
converted, by the vicinity of Plutonic erupted rocks, into a bluish-black, glistening roofing
slate.  Here the planes of stratification are intersected by another system of divisional stratification,
almost at right angles with the former,* and thus indicating an action subsequent to the alteration.

[footnote]  * On the double system of divisional planes, see Elie de Beaumont, 'Geologie de
la France', p. 41; Credner, 'Geognosie Thuringens und des Harzes', s. 40; and Romer, 'Das Rheinische
Uebergangsgebirge', 1844. s. 5 und 9.

The penetration of silica causes the argillaceous schist to be traversed by quartz, transforming
it, in part, into whetstone and silicious schist; the latter sometimes containing carbon, and
being then capable of producing galvanic effects on the nerves.  The highest degree of silicifaction
of schist is that observed in ribbon jasper, a material highly valuable in the arts,* and which
is produced in the Oural Mountains p 260 by the contact and eruption of augitic porphyry (at
Orsk), of dioritic porphyry (at Aufschkul), or of a mass of hypersthenic rock conglomerated
into spherical masses (at Bogoslowsk).  At Monte Serrato, in the island of Elba, according
to Frederic Hoffman, and in Tuscany, according to Alexander Brongniart, it is formed by contact
with euphotide and serpentine.

[footnote]  *The silica is not merely colored by peroxyd of iron, but is accompanied by clay,
lime, and potash.  Rose, 'Reise', bd. ii., s. 187.  On the formation of jasper by the action
of dioritic porphyry, augite, and by persthene rock, see Rose, bd. ii., s. 169, 187, und 192.
See, also, bd. i., s. 427, where there is a drawing of the porphyry spheres between which jasper
occurs, in the calcareous graywacke of Bogoslowsk, being produced by the Plutonic influence
of the augitic rock; bd. ii., s. 545; and likewise Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 486.

The contact and Plutonic action of granite have sometimes made argillaceous schist granular,
as was observed by Gustav Rose and myself in the Altai Mountains (within the fortress of Buchtarminsk),*
and have transformed it into a mass resembling granite, consisting of a mixture of feldspar
and mica, in which larger laminae of the latter were again imbedded.**

[footnote]  *Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 586-588.

[footnote]  **In respect to the volcanic origin of mica, it is important to notice that crystals
of mica are found in the basalt of the Bohemian Mittelgebirge, in the lava that in 1822 was
ejected from Vesuvius (Monticelli, 'Storia del Vesuvio negli Anni 1821 e 1822', 99), and in
fragments of agrillaceous alte imbedded in scoriaceous basalt at Hohenfels, not far from Gerolstein,
in the Eifel (see Mitscherlich, in Leonhard, 'Basalt-Gebilde', s. 244).  On the formation of
feldspar in argillaceous schist, through contact with porphyry, occurring between Urval and
Poet (Forez), see Dufrenoy, in 'Geol. de la France', t. i., p. 137.  It is probably to a similar
contact that certain schists near Paimpol, in Brittany, with whose appearance I was much struck,
while making a geological pedestrian tour through that interesting country with Professor Kunth,
owe their amygdaloid and cellular character, t. i., p. 234.

Most geognosists adhere, with Leopold von Buch, to the well-known hypothesis "that all the
gneiss in the silurian strata of the transition formation, between the Icy Sea and the Gulf
of Finland, has been produced by the metamorphic action of granite.*

[footnote]  * Leopold von Buch, in the 'Abhandlungen der Akad. der Wissenschaft zu Berlin,
aus dem Jahr' 1842, s. 63, and in the 'Jahrbuchern fur Wissenschaftliche Kritik Jahrg.' 1840,
s. 196.

In the Alps, at St. Gothard, calcareous marl is likewise changed from granite into mica slate,
and then transformed into gneiss."  Similar phenomena of the formation of gneiss and mica slate
through granite present themselves in the oolitic group of the Tarantaise,* in which belemnites
are p 261 found in rocks, which have some claim to be considered as mica slate, and in the
schistose group in the western part of the island of Elba, near the promontory of Calamita,
and the Fichtelgebirge in Baireuth, between Loomitz and Markleiten.**

[footnote]  * Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t. xv., p. 362-372.
"In approaching the primitive masses of Mont Rosa, and the mountains situated to the west of
Coni, we perceive that the secondary strata gradually lose the characters inherent in their
mode of deposition. Frequently assuming a character apparently arising from a perfectly distinct
cause, but not losing their stratification, they somewhat resemble in their physical structure
a brand of half-consumed wood, in which we can follow the traces of the ligneous fibers beyond
the spots which continue to present the natural characters of wood."  (See, also, the 'Annales
des Sciences Naturelles', t. xiv., p. 118-122, and von Dechen, 'Geognosie', s. 553.) Among
the most striking proofs of the transformation of rocks by Plutonic action, we must place the
belemites in the schists of Nuffenen (in the Alpine valley of Eginen and in the Gries-glaciers),
and the belemnites found by M. Charpentier in the so-called primitive limestone on the western
descent of the Col de la Seigne, between the Enclove de Monjovet and the 'chalet' of La Lanchette,
and which he showed to me at Bex in the autumn of 1822 ('Annales de Chimie', t. xxiii., p. 262).

[footnote]  ** Hoffmann, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xvi., s. 552, "Strate of transition argillaceous
schist in the Fichtelgebirge, which can be traced for a length of 16 miles, are transformed
into gneiss only at the two extremities, where they come in contact with granite.  We can there
follow the gradual formation of the gneiss, and the development of the mica and of the feldspathic
amygdaloids, in the interior of the argillaceous schist, which indeed contains in itself almost
all the elements of these substances."

Jasper, which,* as I have already remarked, is a production formed by the volcanic action of
augitic porphyry, could only be obtained in small quantities by the ancients, while another
material, very generally and efficiently used by them in the arts, was granular or saccharoidal
marble, which is likewise to be regarded solely as a sedimentary stratum altered by terrestrial
heat and by proximity with erupted rocks.

[footnote]  * Among the works of art which have come down to us from the ancient Greeks and
Romans, we observe that none of any size -- as columns or large vases -- are formed from jasper;
and even at the present day, this substance, in large masses, is only obtained from the Ural
Mountains.  The material worked as jasper from the Rhubarb Mountain (Raveniaga Sopka), in Altai,
is a beautiful ribboned porphyry.  The word 'jasper' is derived from the Semitic languages;
and from the confused description of Theophrastus ('De Lapidibus', 23 and 27) and Pliny (xxxvii.,
8 and 9), who rank jasper among the "opaque gems," the name appears to have been given to fragments
of 'jaspachat', and to a substance which the ancients termed 'jasponyx', which we now know
as 'opal-jasper'.  Pliny considers a piece of jasper eleven inches in length so rare as to
require his mentioning that he had actually seen such a specimen:  "Magnitudinem jaspidis undecim
unciarum vidimus, formatamque inde effigem Neronis thoracatam."  According to Theophrastus,
the stone which he calls emerald, and from which large obelists were cut, must have been an
imperfect jasper.

This opinion is corroborated by the accurate observations on the phenomena of contact, by the
remarkable experiments on fusion p 262 made by Sir James Hall more than half a century ago,
and by the attentive study of granitic veins, which has contributed so largely to the establishment
of modern geognosy.  Sometimes the erupted rock has not transformed the compact into granular
limestone to any great depth from the point of contact.  Thus, for instance, we meet with a
slight transformation -- a penumbra -- as at Belfast, in Ireland, where the basaltic veins
traverse the chalk, and, as in the compact calcareous beds, which have been partially inflected
by the contact of syenitic granite, at the Bridge of Boscampo and the Cascade of Conzocoli,
in the Tyrol (rendered celebrated by the mention made of it by Count Mazari Peucati).*

[footnote[  *Humboldt, 'Lettre a M. Brochant de Villiers', in the 'Annales de Chimie et de
Physique', t. xxiii., p. 261; Leop. von Buch, 'Geog. Briefe uber das sudliche Tyrol', s. 101,
105, und 273.

Another mode of transformation occurs where all the strata of the compact limestone have been
changed into granular limestone by the action of granite, and syenitic or dioritic porphyry.*

[footnote]  *On the transformation of compact into granular limestone by the action of granite,
in the Pyrenees at the 'Montagnes de Rancie', see Dufrenoy, in the 'Memoires Geologiques',
t. ii., p. 440; and on similar changes in the 'Montagnes de l'Oisans', see Elie de Beaumont,
in the 'Mem. Geolog.', t. ii., p. 379-415; on a similar effect produced by the  action of dioritic
and pyroxenic porphyry (the 'ophite' described by Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Geologie de la
France', t. i., p. 72), between Tolosa and St. Sebastian, see Dufrenoy, in the 'Mem. Geolog.',
t. ii., p. 130; and by syenite in the Isle of Skye, where the fossils in the altered limestone
may still be distinguished, see Von Dechen, in his 'Geognosie', p. 573.  In the transformation
of chalk by contact with basalt, the transposition of the most minute particles in the processes
of crystallization and granulation is the more remarkable, because the excellent microscopic
investigations of Ehrenberg have shown that the particles of chalk previously existed in the
form of closed rings.  See Poggend., 'Annalen der Physic', bd. xxxix., s. 105; and on the rings
of aragonite deposited from solution, see Gustav Rose in vol. xlii., p. 354, of the same journal.

I would here wish to make special mention of Parian and Carrara marbles, which have acquired
such celebrity from the noble works of art into which they have been converted, and which have
too long been considered in our geognostic collections as the main types of primitive limestone.
The action of granite has been manifested sometimes by immediate contact, as in the Pyrenees,*
and sometimes, as in the main land of Greece, and in the insular groups in the gean Sea, through
the intermediate layers of gneiss or mica slate.

[footnote]  *Beds of granular limestone in the granite at Port d'Oo and in the Mont de Labourd.
See Charpentier, 'Constitution Geologique des Pyrenes', p. 144, 146.

Both cases presuppose a simultaneous but heterogeneous process of transformation. p 263 In
Attica, in the island of Euboea, and in the Peloponnesus, it has been remarked, "that the limestone,
when superposed on mica slate, is beautiful and crystalline in proportion to the purity of
the latter substance and to the smallness of its argillaceous contents; and, as is well known,
this rock, together with beds of gneiss, appears at many points, at a considerable depth below
the surface, in the islands of Paros and Antiparos."*

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Descr. des Canaries', p. 394; Fiedler, 'Reise durch das Konigreich
Griechenland', th. ii., s., 181, 190, und 516.

We may here infer the existence of an imperfectly metamorphosed flotz formation, if faith can
be yielded to the testimony of Origen, according to whom, the ancient Eleatic, Xenophanes of
Colophon* (who supposed the whole earth's crust to have been once covered by the sea), declared
that marine fossils had been found in the quarries of Syracuse, and the impression of a fish
(a sardine) in the deepest rocks of Paros.

[footnote]  *I have previously alluded to the remarkable passage in Origen's 'Philosophumena',
cap. 14 ('Opera', ed. Delarue, t. i., p. 893).  From the whole context, it seems very improbable
that Xenophanes meant an impression of a laurel ([Greek words]) instead of an impression of
a fish ([Greek words]).  Delarue is wrong in blaming the correction of Jacob Gronovius in changing
the laurel into a sardel.  The petrifaction of a fish is also much more probable than the natural
picture of Silenus, which, according to Pliny (lib. xxxvi., 5), the quarry-men are stated to
have met with in Parian marble from Mount Marpessos.  'Servius ad Virg., AEn.', vi., 471.

The Carrara or Luna marble quarries, which constituted the principal source from which statuary
marble was derived even prior to the time of Augustus, and which will probably continue to
do so until the quarries of Paros shall be reopened, are beds of calcareous sandstone -- macigno
-- altered by Plutonic action, and occurring in the insulated mountain of Apuana, between gneiss-like
mica and talcose schist.*

[footnote]  *On the geognostic relations of Carrara ('The City of the Moon', Strabo, lib. v.,
p. 222), see Savi 'Osservazioni sui terreni antichi Toscani', in the 'Nuova Giornale de' Letterati
di Pisa', and Hoffmann, in Karsten's 'Archiv fur Mineralogie', bd. vi., s. 258-263, as well
as in his 'Geogn. Reise durch Italien', s. 244-265.

Whether at some points granular limestone may not have been formed in the interior of the earth,
and been raised by gneiss and syenite to the surface, where it forms vein-like fissures,* is
a question on which I can not hazard an opinion, owing to my own want of personal knowledge
of the subject.

[footnote]  *According to the assumption of an excellent and very experienced observer, Karl
von Leonhard.  See his 'Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie', 1834 s. 329, and Bernhard Cotta, 'Geognosie',
s. 310.

p 264 According to the admirable observations of Leopold von Buch, the masses of dolomite found
in Southern Tyrol, and on the Italian side of the Alps, present the most remarkable instance
of metamorphism produced by massive eruptive rocks on compact calcareous beds.  The formation
of the limestone seems to have proceeded from the fissures which traverse it in all directions.
The cavities are every where covered with rhomboidal crystals of magnesian bitter spar, and
the whole formation, without any trace of strtification, or of the fossil remains which it
once contained, consists only of a granular aggregation of crystals of dolomite.  Talc laminae
lie scattered here and there in the newly-formed rock, traversed by masses of serpentine. 
In the valley of the Fassa, dolomite rises perpendicularly in smooth walls of dazzling whiteness
to a height of many thousand feet.  It forms sharply-pointed conical mountains, clustered together
in large numbers, but yet not in contact with each other.  The contour of their forms recalls
to mind the beautiful landscape with which the rich imagination of Leonardi da Vinci has embellished
the back-ground of the portrait of Mona Lisa.

The geognostic phenomena which we are now describing, and which excite the imagination as well
as the powers of the intellect, are the result of the action of augite porphyry manifested
in its elevating, destroying, and transforming force.*

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Geognostische Briefe an Alex. von Humboldt', 1824, s. 86 and
82; also in the 'Annalen de Chemie', t. xxiii., p. 276, and in the 'Abhandl. der Berliner Akad.
aus der Jahren 1822 'und' 1823, s. 83-136; Von Dechen, 'Geognosie.' s. 574-576.

The process by which limestone is converted into dolomite is not regarded by the illustrious
investigator who first drew attention to the phenomenon as the consequence of the tale being
derived from the black porphyry, but rather as a transformatiion simultaneous with the appearance
of this erupted stone through wide fissures filled with vapors.  It remains for future inquirers
to determine how transformation can have been effected without contact with the endogenous
stone, where strata of dolomite are found to be interspersed in imestone.  Where, in this case,
are we to seek the concealed channels by which the Plutonic action is conveyed?  Even here
it may not, however, be necessary, in conformity with the old Roman adage, to believe "that
much that is alike in nature may have been formed in wholly different ways."  When we find,
over widely extended parts of the earth, that two phenomena are always associated together,
as, for instance, the occurrence of melaphyre p 265 and the transformation of compact limestone
into a crystaline mass differing in its chemical character, we are, to a certain degree, justified
in believing, where the second phenomenon is manifested unattended by the appearance of the
first, that this apparent contradiction is owing to the absence, in certain cases, of some
of the conditions attendant upon the exciting causes.  Who would call in question the volcanic
nature and igneous fluidity of basalt merely because there are some rare instances in which
basaltic veins, traversing beds of coal or strata of sandstone and chalk, have not materially
deprived the coal of its carbon, nor broken and slacked the sandstone, not converted the chalk
into granular marble?  Wherever we have obtained even a faint light to guide us in the obscure
domain of mineral formation, we ought not ungratefully to disregard it, because there may be
much that is still unexplained in the history of the relations of the transitions, or in the
isolated interposition of beds of unaltered strata.

After having spoken of the alteration of compact carbonate of lime into granular limestone
and dolomite, it still remains for us to mention a third mode of transformation of the same
mineral, which is ascribed to the emission, in the ancient periods of the world, of the vapors
of sulphuric acid.  This transformation of limestone into gypsum is analogous to the penetration
of rock salt and sulphur, the latter being deposited from sulphureted aqueous vapor.  In the
lofty Cordilleras of Quindin, far from all volcanoes, I have observed deposits of sulphur in
fissures in gneiss, while in Sicily (at Cattolica, near Girgenti), sulphur, gypsum, and rock
salt belong to the most recent secondary strata, the chalk formations.*

[footnote]  *Horrman, 'Geogn. Reise', edited by Von Dechen, s. 113-119, and 380-386; Poggend.,
'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxvi., s. 41.

I have also seen on the edge of the crater of Vesuvius, fissures filled with rock salt, which
occurred in such considerable masses as occasionally to lead to its being disposed of by contraband
trade.  On both declivities of the Pyrenees, the connection of diorite and pyroxene, and colomite,
gypsum, and rock salt, can not be questioned;* and here, as in the other phenomena which we
have been considering, every thing bears evidence of the action of subterranean forces on the
sedimentary strata of the ancient sea.

[footnote]  *Dufrenoy, in the 'Memoires Geologiques', t. ii., p. 145 and 179.

There is much difficulty in explaining the origin of the beds of pure quartz, which occur in
such large quantities in South America, and impart so peculiar a character to the chain of
p 266 the Andes.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Essai Geogn. sur le Gisement des Roches', p. 93; 'Asie Centrale', t.
iii., p. 532.

In descending toward the South Sea, from Caxamarca toward Guangamarca, I have observed vast
masses of quartz, from 7000 to 8000 feet in height, superposed sometimes on porphyry devoid
of quartz, and sometimes on diorite.

In the Brazils, in the diamond district of Minas Geraes and St. Paul, which has recently been
so accurately investigated by Clausen, Plutonic action has developed in dioritic veins sometimes
ordinary mica, and sometimes specular iron in quartzose itacolumite.  The diamonds of Grammagoa
are imbedded in strata of solid silica, and are occasionally enveloped in laminae of mica,
like the garnets found in mica slate.  The diamonds that occur furthest to the north, as those
discovered in 1829 at 58 degrees lat., on the European slope of the Uralian Mountains, bear
a geognostic relation to the black carboniferous dolomite of Adolffskoi* and to augitic porphyry,
although more accurate observations are required in order fully to elucidate this subject.

[footnote]  *Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 364 und 367.

Among the most remarkable phenomena of contact, we must, finally, enumerate the formation of
garnets in argillaceous schist in contact with basalt and dolerite (as in Northumberland and
the island of Anglesea), and the occurrence of a vast number of beautiful and most various
crystals, as garnets, vesuvian, augite, and ceylanite, on the surfaces of contact between the
erupted and sedimentary rock, as, for instance, on the junction of the syenite of Monzon with
dolomite and compact limestone.

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Briefe', s. 109-129.  See also, Elie de Beaumont 'On the Contact
of Granite with the Beds of the Jura', in the 'Mem. Geol.' t. ii., p. 408.

In the island of Elba, masses of serpentine, which perhaps nowhere more clearly indicate the
character of erupted rocks, have occasioned the sublimation of iron glance and red oxyd of
iron in fissures of calcareous sandstone.

[footnote]  *Hoffman, 'Reise', s. 30 und 37.

We still daily find the same iron glance formed by sublimation from the vapors and the walls
of the fissures of open veins on the margin of the crater, and in the fresh lava currents of
the volcanoes of Stromboli, Vesuvius, and AEtna.*

[footnote]  *On the chemical process in the formation of specular iron, see Gay Lussac, in
the 'Annales de Chimie', t. xxii., p. 415, and Mitscherlich, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xv.,
s. 630.  Moreover, crystals of olivine have been formed (probaby by sublimation) in the cavities
of the obsidian of Cerro del Jacal, which I brought from Mexico (Gustav Rose, in Poggend.,
'Annalen', bd. x., s. 323).  Hence olivine occurs in basalt, lava, obsidian, artificial scoriae
in meteoric stones, in the syenite of Elfdale, and (as hyalosiderite) in the wacke of the Kaiserstuhl.

The veins that p 267 are thus formed beneath our eyes by volcanic forces, where the contiguous
rock has already attained a certain degree of solidification, show us how, in a similar manner,
mineral and metallic veins may have been every where formed in the more ancient periods of
the world, where the solid but thinner crust of our planet, shaken by earthquakes, and rent
and fissured by the change of volume to which it was subjected in cooling, may have presented
many communications with the interior, and many passages for the escape of vapors impregnated
with earthy and metallic substances.  The arrangement of the particles in layers parallel with
the margins of the beins, the regular recurrence of analogous layers on the opposite sides
of the veins (on their different walls), and, finally, the elongated cellular cavities in the
middle, frequently afford direct evidence of the Plutonic process of sublimation in metalliferous
veins.  As the traversing rocks must be of more recent origin than the traversed, we learn
from the relations of stratification existing between the porphyry and the argentiferous ores
in the Saxon mines (the richest and most important in Germany), that these formations are at
any rate more recent than the vegetable remains found in carboniferous strata and in the red
sandstone.*

der Werner'schen Gangtheorie', 1840, s. 6; and C. von Wissenbach, 'Abbildungen merkwurdiger
Gangverhaltnisse', 1836, fig. 12.  The ribbon-like structure of the veins is, however, no more
to be regarded of general occurrence than the periodic order of the different members of these
masses.

All the facts connected with our geological hypotheses on the formation of the earth's crust
and the metamorphism of rocks have been unexpectedly elucidated by the ingenious idea which
led to a comparison of the slags or scoriae of our smelting furnaces with natural minerals,
and to the attempt of reproducing the latter from their elements.*

[footnote]  *Mitscherlich, 'Ueber die kunstliche Darstellung der Mineralien', in the 'Abhandl.
der Akademie der Wiss. zu Berlin', 1822-3, s. 25-41.

In all these operations, the same affinities manifest themselves which determine chemical combinations
both in our laboratories and in the interior of the earth.  The most considerable part of p
268 the simple minerals which characterize the more generally diffused Plutonic and erupted
rocks, as well as those on which they have exercised a metamorphic action, have been produced
in a crystalline state, and with perfect identify, in artificial mineral products.  We must,
however, distinguish here between the scoriae accidentally formed, and those which have been
designedly produced by chemists.  To the former belong feldspar, mica, augite, olivine, hornblende,
crystallized oxyd of iron, magnetic iron in octahedral crystals, and metallis titanium;* to
the latter, garnets, idocrase, rubies (equal in hardness to those found in the East), olivine,
and augite.**

[footnote]  *In scoriae crystals of feldspar have been discovered by Heine in the refuse of
a furnace for copper fusing, near Sangerhausen, and analyzed by Kersten (Poggend., 'Annalen',
bd. xxxiii., s. 337); crystals of augite in scoriae at Sahle (Mitscherlich, in the 'Abhandl.
der Akad. zu Berlin', 1822-23, s. 40); of oliving by Seifstrom (Leonhard, 'Basalt-Gebilde',
bd. ii., s. 495); of mica in old scoriae of Schloss Garpenberg (Mitscherlich, in Leonhard,
op. cit., s. 506); of magnetic iron in the scoriae of Chatillon sur Seine (Leonhard, s. 441);
and of micaceous iron in potter's clay (Mitscherlich, in Leohnard, op. cit., s. 234). [See
Ebelmer's papers in 'Ann. de Chimie et de Physique', 1847; also 'Report on the Crystalline
Slags', by John Percy, M.D., F.R.S., and William Hallows Miller, M.A., 1847.  Dr. Percy, in
a communication with which he has kindly favored me, says that the minerals which he has found
artificially produced and proved by analysis are Humboldtilite, gehlenite, olivine, and magnetic
oxyd of iron, in octahedral crystals.  He suggests that the circumstance of the production
of gehlenite at a high temperature in an iron furnace may possibly be made available by geologists
in explaining the formation of the rocks in which the natural mineral occurs, as in Fassathal
in the Tyrol.] -- Tr.

[footnote]  **Of minerals purposely produced, we may mention idocrase and garnet (Mitscherlich,
in Poggend., 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxxii., s. 340); ruby (Gaudin, in the 'Comptes Rendus
de l'Academie de Science', t. iv., Part i., p. 999); olivine and augite (Mitscherlich and Berthier,
in the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t. xxiv., p. 376).  Notwithstanding the greatest
possible similarity in crystalline form, and perfect identity in chemical composition, existing,
according to Gustav Rose, between augite and hornblende, hornblende has never been found accompanying
augite in scoriae, nor have chemists ever succeeded in artificially producing either hornblende
or feldspar (Mitscherlich in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiii., s. 340, and Rose, 'Reise nach
dem Ural', bd. ii., s. 358 und 363).  See also, Beaudant, in the 'Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences',
t. viii., p. 221, and Becquerel's ingenious experiments in his 'Trait de l'Electricite,' t.
i., p. 334; t. iii., p. 218; and t. v., p. 148 and 185.

These minerals constitute the main constituents of granite, gneiss, and mica schist, of basalt,
dolerite, and many porphyries.  The artificial production of feldspar and mica is of most especial
geognostic importance with reference to the theory of the formation of gneiss by the metamorphic
agency of argillaceous schist, which contains all the constituents of granite, p 269 potash
not excepted.*

[footnote]  *D'Aubuisson, in the 'Journal de Physique', t. lxviii., p. 128.

It would not be very surprising, therefore, as is well observed by the distinguished geognosist,
Von Dechen, if we were to meet with a fragment of gneiss formed on the walls of a smelting
furnace which was built of argillaceous slate and graywacke.

After  having taken this general view of the three classes of erupted, sedimentary, and metamorphic
rocks of the earth's crust, it still remains for us to consider the fourth class, comprising
'conglomerates', or 'rocks of detrius'.  The very term recalls the destruction which the earth's
crust has suffered, and likewise, perhaps reminds us of the process of cementation, which has
connected together, by means of oxyd of iron, or of some argillaceous and calcareous substances,
the sometimes rounded and sometimes angular portions of fragments.  Conglomerates and rocks
of detritus, when considered in the widest sense of the term, manifest characters of a double
origin.  The substances which enter into their mechanical composition have not been alone accumulated
by the action of the waves of the sea or currents of fresh water, for there are some of these
rocks the formation of which can not be attributed to the action of water. "When basaltic islands
and trachytic rocks rise on fissures, friction of the elevated rock against the walls of the
fissures causes the elevated rock to be inclosed by conglomerates composed of its own matter.
The granules composing the sandstones of many formations have been separated rather by friction
against the erupted volcanic or Plutonic rock than destroyed by the erosive force of a neighboring
sea.  The existence of these friction 'conglomerates', which are met with in enormous masses
in both hemispheres, testifies the intensity of the force with which the erupted rocks have
been propelled from the interior through the earth's crust.  This detritus has subsequently
been taken up by the waters, which have then deposited it in the strata which it still covers."*

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buck, 'Geognost. Briefe', s. 75-82, where it is also shown why the new
red sandstone (the 'Todtliegende' of the Thuringian flotz formation) and the coal measures
must be regarded as produced by erupted porphyry.

Sandstone formations are found imbedded in all strata, from the lower silurian transition stone
to the beds of the tertiary formations, superposed on the chalk. They are found on the margin
of the boundless plains of the New Continent, both within and without the tropics, extending
like breast-works along the ancient shore, against which the sea once broke its foaming waves.

p 270 If we cast a glance on the geographical distribution of rocks, and their relations in
space, in that portion of the earth's crust which is accessible to us, we shall find that the
most universally distributed chemical substance is 'silicic acid', generally in a variously-colored
and opaque form.  Next to solid silicic acid we must reckon carbonate of lime, and then the
combinations of silicic acid with alumina, potash, and soda, with lime, magnesia, and oxyd of iron.

The substances which we designate as 'rocks' are determinate associations of a small number
of minerals, in which some combine parasitically, as it were, with others, but only under definite
relations; thus, for instance, although quartz (silica), feldspar, and mica are the principal
constituents of granite, these minerals also occur, either individually or collectively, in
many other formations.  By way of illustrating how the quantitative relations of one feldspathic
rock differ from another, richer in mica than the former, I would mention that, according to
Mitscherlich, three times more alumina and one third more silica than that ossessed by feldspar,
give the constituents that enter into the composition of mica.  Potash is contained in both
-- a substance whose existence in many kinds of rocks is probably antecedent to the dawn of
vegetation on the earth's surface.

The order of succession, and the relative age of the different formations, may be recognized
by the superposition of the sedimentary, metamorphic, and conglomerate strata; by the nature
of the formations traversed by the erupted masses, and -- with the greatest certainty -- by
the presence of organic remains and the differences of their structure.  The application of
botanical and zoological evidence to determine the relative age of rocks -- this chronometry
of the earth's surface, which was already present to the lofty mind of Hooke -- indicates one
of the most glorious epochs of modern geognosy, which has finally, on the Continent at least,
been emancipated from the sway of Semitic doctrines.  Palaeontological investigations have
imparted a vivifying breath of grace and diversity to the science of the solid structure of
the earth.

The fossiliferous strata contain, entombed within them, the floras and faunas of by-gone ages.
We ascend the stream of time, as in our study of the relations of superposition we descend
deeper and deeper through the different strata, in which lies revealed before us a past world
of animal and vegetable life.  Far-extending disturbances, the elevation of great mountain
chains, whose relative ages we are able to define, attest the p 271 destruction of ancient
and the manifestation of recent organisms.  A few of these older structures have remained in
the midst of more recent species. Owing to the limited nature of our knowledge of existence,
and from the figurative terms by which we seek to hide our ignorance, we apply the appellation
'recent structure' to the historical henomena of transition manifested in the organisms as
well as in the forms of primitive seas and of elevated lands.  In some cases these organized
structures have been preserved perfect in the minutest details of tissues, integument, and
articulated parts, while in others, the animal, passing over soft argillaceous mud, has left
nothing but the traces of its course,* or the remains of its undigested food, as in the coprolites.**

[footnote]  *[In certain localities of the new red sandstone, in the Valley of the Connecticut,
numerous tridactyl markings have been occasionally observed on the surface of the slabs of
stone when split asunder, in like manner as the ripple-marks appear on the successive layers
of sandstone in Tilgate Forest.  Some remarkably distinct impressions of this kind, at Turner's
Falls (Massachusetts), happening to attract the attention of Dr. James Deane, of Greenfield,
that sagacious observer was struck with their resemblance to the foot-marks left on the mud-banks
of the adjacent river by the aquatic birds which had recenty frequented the spot.  The specimens
collected were submitted to Professor G. Hitchcock, who followed up the inquiry with a zeal
and success that have led to the most interesting results.  No reasonable doubt now exists
that the imprints in question have been produced by the tracks of bipeds impressed on the stone
when in a soft state.  The announcement of this extraordinary phenomenon was first made by
Professor Hitchcock, in the 'American Journal of Science' (January, 1836), and that eminent
geologist has since published full descriptions of the different species of imprints which
he has detected, in his splendid work on the geology of Massachusetts. -- Mantell's 'Medals
of Creation', vol. ii., p. 310.  In the work of Dr. Mantell above referred to, there is, in
vol. ii., p. 815, an admirable diagram of a slab from Turner's Falls, covered with numerous
foot-marks of birds, indicating the track of ten or twelve individuals of different sizes.] -- Tr.

[footnote]  **[From the examination of the fossils spoken of by geologists under the name of
'Coprolites', it is easy to determine the nature of the food of the animals, and some other
points; and when, as happened occasionally, the animal was killed while the process of digestion
was going on, the stomach and intestines being partly filled with half-digested food, and exhibiting
the coprolites actually 'in situ', we can make out with certainty not only the true nature
of the food, but the proportionate size of the stomach, and the length and nature of the intestinal
canal.  Within the cavity of the rib of an extinct animal, the palaeontologist thus finds recorded,
in indelible characters, some of those hieroglyphics upon which he founds his history. -- 'The
Ancient World', by D. T. Ansted, 1847, p. 173.] -- Tr.

In the lower Jura formations (the lias of Lyme Regis), the ink bag of the sepia has been so
wonderfully preserved, that the material, which myriads p 272 of years ago might have served
the animal to conceal itself from its enemies, still yields the color with which its image
may be drawn.*

[footnote]  *A discovery made by Miss Mary Anning, who was likewise the
discoverer of the coprolites of fish.  These coprolites, and the excrements
of the Ichthyosauri, have been found in such abundance in England (as, for
instance, near Lyme Regis), that, according to Buckland's expression, they
lie like potatoes scattered in the ground.  See Buckland, 'Geology
considered with reference to Natural Theology', vol. i., p. 188-202 and 305.
 With respect to the hope expressed by Hooke "to raise a chronology" from
the mere study of broken and fossilized shells "and to state the interval of
time wherein such or such castrophes and mutations have happened," see his
'Posthumous Works, Lecture', Feb. 29, 1688.
[Still more wonderful is the preservation of the substance of the animal of
certain Cephalopodes in the Oxford clay. In some specimens recently
obtained, and described by Professor Owen, not only the ink bag, but the
muscular mantle, the head, and its crown of arms, are all preserved in
connection with the belemnite shell, while one specimen exhibits the large
eyes and the funnel of the animal, and the remains of two fins, in addition
to the shell and the ink bag.  See Ansted's 'Ancient World', p. 147.] -- Tr.

In other strata, again, nothing remains but the faint impression of a muscle shell; but even
this, if it belong to a main dividion of mollusca,* may serve to show the traveler, in some
distant land, the nature of the rock in which it is found, and the organic remains with which
it is associated.

Its discovery gives the history of the country in which it occurs.

The analytic study of primitive animal and vegetable life has taken a double direction:  the
one is purely morphological, and embraces, especially, the natural history and physiology of
organisms, filling up the chasms in the series of still living species by the fossil structures
of the primitive world.  The second is more specially geognostic, considering fossil remains
in their relations to the superposition and relative age of the sedimentary formations.  The
former has long predominated over the latter, and an imperfect and superficial comparison of
fossil remains with existing species has led to errors, which may still be traced in the extraordinary
names applied to certain natural bodies.  It was sought to identify all fossil species with
those still extant in the same manner as, in the sixteenth century, men were led by false analogies
to compare the animals of the New Continent with those of the Old.  Peter Camper, Sommering,
and Blumenbach had the merit of being the first, by the scientific application of a more accurate
p 273 comparative anatomy, to throw light on the osteological branch of palaeontology -- the
archaeology of organic life; but the actual geognostic views of the doctrine of fossil remains,
the felicitous combination of the zoological character with the order of succession, and the
relative ages of strata, are due to the labors of George Cuvier and Alexander Brongniart.

The ancient sedimentary formations and those of transition rocks exhibit, in the organic remains
contained within them, a mixture of structures very variously situated on the scale of progressively-developed
organisms.  These strata contain but few plants, as, for instance, some species of Fuci, Lycopodiaceae
which were probably arborescent, Equisetaceae, and tropical ferns; they present, however, a
singular association of animal forms, consisting of Crustacea (trilobites with reticulated
eyes, and Calymene), Brachiopoda ('Spirifer, Orthis'), elegant Sphaeronites, nearly allied
to the Crinoidea,* Orthoceraitites, of the family of the Cephalopoda, corals, and, blended
with these low organisms, fishes of the most singular forms, imbedded in the upper silurian
formations.

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Gebirgsformationen von Russland', 1840, s. 24-50.

The Goniatites, of the tribe of Ammonites,* a are manifested in the transition chalk, in the
graywacke of the devonian periods, and even in the latest silurian formations.

[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, in the 'Abhandl. der Berl. Akad.', 1838, s. 149-168; Beyrich,
'Beitr. zur Kenntniss des Rheinischen Uebergangagebirges', 1837, s. 45.

The dependence of physiological gradation upon the age of the formations, which has not hitherto
been shown with perfect certainty in the case of invertebrata,* is most regularly manifested
in vertebrated animals.

[footnote]  *Agassiz, 'Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles', t. i., 'Introd.', p. xviii.;
Davy, 'Consolation in Travel', dial. iii.

The most ancient of these, as we have already seen, are fishes; next in the order of succession
of formation, passing from the lower to the upper, come reptiles and mammalia.  The first reptile
(a Saurian, the Monitor of Cuvier), which excited the attention of Leibnitz,* is found in cuperiferous
schist of the Zechstein of Thuringa; the Palaeosaurus and Thecodontosaurus of  Bristol are,
according to Murchison, of the same age.

[footnote]  *A Protosaurus, according to Hermann von Meyer.  The rib of a Saurian asserted
to have been found in the mountain limestone (carbonate of lime) of Northumberland (Herm. von
Meyer, 'Palaeologica', s. 299), is regarded by Lyell ('Geology', 1832, vol. i., p. 148) as
very doubtful.  The discoverer himself referred it to the alluvial strata which cover the mountain
limestone.

The Saurians are found in large numbers in the muschelkalk,* in the keuper, and in the oolitic
formations, where they are the most numerous.

[footnote]  *F. von Alberti, 'Monographie des Bunten Sandsteins, Muschelkalks und Keupers',
1834, s. 119 und 314.

At the period of these formations there existed Pleiosauri, having long, swan-like necks consisting
of thirty vertebrae; Megalosauri, monsters resembling the crocodile, forty-five feet in length,
and having feet whose bones were like those of terrestrial mammalia, eight species of large-eyed
Ichthyosauri, the Geosaurus or 'Lacerta gigantea', of Sommering, and finally, seven remarkable
species of Pterodactyles,* of Saurians furnished with membranous wings.

[footnote]  *See Hermann von Meyer's ingenious considertions regarding the organization of
the flying Saurians, in his 'Palaeologica', s. 228-252.  In the fossil specimen of the Pterodactylus
crassirostris, which, as well as the loonger known P. longirostris (Ornithocephalus of Sommering),
was found at Solenhofen, in the lithographic slate of the upper Jura formation, Professor Goldfuss
has even discovered traces of the membranous wing, "with the impressions of curling tufts of
hair, in some places a full inch in length."

In the chalk the number of the crocodilial Saurians diminishes, although
this epoch is characterized by the so-called crocodile of Maestricht (the
Mososaurus of Conybeare), and the colossal, probably graminivorous Iguandon.
 Cuvier has found animals belonging to the existing families of the
crocodile in the tertiary formation, and Scheuchzer's 'antediluvian man'
('homo diluvii testis'), a large salamander allied to the Axolotl, which I
brought with me from the large Mexican lakes, belongs to the most recent
fresh-water formations of Oeningen.*

[footnote]  *[Ansted's 'Ancient World', p. 56.] -- Tr.

The determination of the relative ages of organisms by the superposition of the strata has
led to important results regarding the relations which have been discovered between extinct
families and species (the latter being but few in number) and those which still exist.  Ancient
and modern observations concur in showing that the fossil floras and faunas differ more from
the present vegetable and animal forms in proportion as they belong to lower, that is, more
ancient sedimentary formations.  The numerical relations first deduced by Cuvier p 275 from
the great phenomena of the metamorphism of organic life,* have led, through the admirable labors
of Deshayes and Lyell, to the most marked results, especially with reference to the different
groups of the tertiary formations, which contain a considerable number of accurately investigated
structures.

[footnote]  *Cuvier, 'Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles', t. i., p. 52-57.  See, also, the
geological scale of epochs in Phillips's 'Geology', 1837, p. 166-185.

Agassiz, who has examined 1700 species of fossil fishes, and who estimates the number of living
species which have either been described or are preserved in museums at 8000, expressly  says,
in his masterly work, that, "with the exception of a few small fossil fishes peculiar to the
argillaceous geodes of Greenland, he has not found any animal of this class in all the  transition,
secondary or tertiary formations, which is specifically identical with any still extant fish."
He subjoins the important observation "that in the lower tertiary formations, for instance,
in the coarse granular calcareous beds, and in the London clay,* one third of the fossil fishes
belong to wholly extinct families.

[footnote]  *[See 'Wonders of Geology', vol. i., p. 230.] -- Tr.

Not a single species of a still extant family is to be found under the chalk, while the remarkable
family of the 'Sauroidi' (fishes with enameled scales), almost allied to reptiles, and which
are found from the coal beds -- in which the larger species lie -- to the chalk, where they
occur individually, bear the same relation to the two families (the Lepidosteus and Polypterus)
which inhabit the American rivers and the Nile, as our present elephants and tapirs do to the
Mastodon and Anaplotheriun of the primitive world."*

[footnote]  *Agassiz, 'Poissons Fossiles', t. i., p. 30, and t. iii., p. 1-52; Buckland, 'Geology',
vol. i., p. 273-277.

The beds of chalk which contain two of these sauroid fishes and gigantic reptiles, and a whole
extinct world of corals and muscles, have been proved by Ehrenberg's beautiful discoveries
to consist of microscopic Polythalamia, many of which still exist in our seas, and in the middle
latitudes of the North Sea and Baltic.  The first group of tertiary formations above the chalk,
which has been designated as belonging to the 'Eocene Period', does not, therefore, merit that
designation, since "the 'dawn of the world' in which we live extends much further back in the
history of the past than we have hitherto supposed."*

[footnote]  *Ehrenberg, 'Ueber noch jetzt lebende Thierarten der Kreidelnldung', in the 'Abhandl.
der Berliner Akad.', 1839, s. 164.

As we have already seen, fishes, which are the most ancient of all vertebrata, are found in
the silurian transition strata, p 276 and then uninterruptedly on through all formations to
the strata of the tertiary period, while Saurians begin with the zechstone.  In like manner,
we find the first mammalia ('Thylacotherium Prevostii', and 'T. Bucklandii', which are nearly
allied according to Valenciennes,*  with marsupial animals) in the oolitic formations (Stonesfield
schist), and the first birds in the most ancient cretaceous strata.**

number in the gypsum of the tertiary formations. Cuvier, 'Ossemens Fossiles', t. ii., p. 302-328.

Such are, according to the present state of our knowledge, the lowest* limits of fishes, Saurians,
mammalia, and birds.

[footnote]  *[Recent collections from the southern hemisphere show that this distribution was
not so universal during the earlier epochs as has generally been supposed.  See papers by Darwin,
Sharpe, Morris, and McCoy, in the 'Geological Journal'.] -- Tr'.

Although corals and Serpulidae occur in the most ancient formations simultaneously with highly-developed
Cephalopodes and Crustaceans, thus exhibiting the most various orders grouped together, we
yet discover very determinate laws in the case of many individual groups of one and the same
orders.  A single species of fossil, as Goniatites, Trilobites, or Nummulites, sometimes constitutes
whole mountains.  Where  different families are blended together, a determinate succession
of organisms has not only been observed with reference to the superposition of the formations,
but the association of certain families and species has also been noticed in the lower strata
of the same formation.

The lower limits of Belemnites are, in the keuper, covered by Jura limestone, and their upper
limits in the chalk formations.*

[footnote]  *Quenstedt, 'Flotzgebirge Wurtembergs', 1843, s. 135.

It appears, from what we now know of this subject, that the waters must have
been inhabited at the same epoch, and in the most widely-remote districts of
the world, by shell-fish, which were at any rate, in part, identical with
the fossil remains found in England.  Leopold von Buch has discovered
exogyra and trigonia in the southern hemisphere (volcano of
p 277
Maypo in Chili), and D'Orbigny has described Ammonites and Gryphites from
the Himalaya and the Indian plains of Cutch, these remains being identical
with those found in the old Jurassic sea of Germany and France.
 If certain strata, their parallelism, or their total suppression.  If we
classify the type of the sedimentary structures in the simplest mode of
generalization, we arrive at the following series in proceeding from below
upward:
1.  The so-called 'transition rocks', in the two divisions of upper and
lower graywacke (silurian and devonian systems), the latter being formerly
designated as old red sandstone.
2.  The 'lower trias',* comprising mountain limestone, coal-measures,
together with the lower new red sandstone (Todtliegende and Zechstein).**
3.  The 'upper trias', including variegated sandstone,** muschelkalk, and
keuper.
4.  'Jura limestone' (lias and oolite).
5.  'Green sandstone', the quader sanstein, upper and lower chalk,
terminating the secondary formations, which begin with limestone.
6.  'Tertiary formations' in three divisions, distinguished as granular
limestone, the lignites, and the sub-Apennine gravel of Italy.

[footnote]  *Quenstedt, 'Flotzgebirge Wurtembergs', 1843, s. 13.

[footnote]  ** Murchison makes two divisions of the 'bunter sandstone', the upper being the
same as the 'trias' of Alberti, while the lower division, to which the 'Vosges sandstone' of
Elie de Beaumont belongs -- the 'zeckstein' and the 'todtliegende' -- he forms his 'Permian'
system.  He makes the secondary formations commence with the 'upper trias', that is to say,
with the upper division of our (German) bunter sandstone, while the  Permian system, the carboniferous
or mountain limestone, and the devonian and silurian strata, constitute his 'palaeozoic formatiions'.
According to these views, the chalk and Jura constitute the upper, and the keuper, the muschelkalk,
and the bunter sandstone the lower secondary formations, while the Permian system and the carboniferous
limestone are the upper, and the devonian and silurian strata are the lower palaeooic formation.
The fundamental principles of this general classification are developed in the great work in
which this indefatigable British geologist purposes to describe the geology of a large part
of Eastern Europe.

Then follow, in the alluvial beds, the colossal bones of the mammalia of the primitive world,
as the mastodon, dinothrium p 278 missurium, and the megatherides, among which is Owen's sloth-like
mylodon, eleven feet in the length.*

[footnote]  *[See Mantell's 'Wonders of Geology', vol. i., p. 168.] -- Tr.

Besides these extinct families, we find the fossil remains of still extant animals, as the
elephant, rhinoceros, ox, horse, and stag.  The field near Bogota, called the 'Campo de Gigantes',
which is filled with the bones of mastodons, and in which I caused excavations to be made,
lies 8740 feet above the level of the sea, while the osseous remains, found in the elevated
plateaux of Mexico, belong to true elephants of extinct species.*

 See, also, Humboldt, 'Ueber die Hochebene von Bogota', in the 'Deutschen
Vierteljahrs-schrift', 1839, bd. i., s. 117.

The projecting spurs of the Himalaya, the Sewalik Hills, which have been so zealously investigated
by Captain Cantley* and Dr. Falconer, and the Cordilleras, whose elevations are probably, of
very different epochs, contain, besides numerous mastodons, the sivatherium, and the gigantic
land tortoise of the primitive world ('Colossochelys'),  which is twelve feet in length and
six in height, and several extant families, as elephants, rhinoceroses, and giraffes; and it
is a remarkable fact, that these remains are found in a zone which still enjoys the same tropical
climate which must be supposed to have prevailed at the period of the mastodons.**

[footnote]  *[The fossil fauna of the Sewalik range of hills, skirting the southern base of
the Himalaya, has proved more abundant in genera and species of mammalia than that of any other
region yet explored.  As a general expression of the leading features, it may be stated, that
it appears to have been composed of representative forms of all ages, from the 'oldest of the
tertiary period down to the modern', and of 'all the geographical' divisions of the Old Continent
grouped together into one comprehensive fauna.  'Fauna Antiqua Sivaliensis', by Hugh Falconer,

Having thus passed in review both the inorganic formations of the earth's crust and the animal
remains which are contained within it, another branch of the history of the organic life still
remains for our consideration, viz., the epoch of vegetation, and the successive floras that
have occurred simultaneously with the increasing extent of the dry land and the modifications
of the atmosphere.  The oldest transition strata, as we have already observed, contain merely
cellular marine plants, and it is only in the devonian system that a few cryptogamic forms
of vascular plants (Calamites and Lycopodiaceae) have been observed.*

[footnote]  *Beyrich, in Karsteu's 'Archiv fur Mineralogie', 1844, bd. xviii., s. 218.

Nothing appears to corroborate p 279 the theoretical views that have been started regarding
the simplicity of primitive forms of organic life, ow that vegetable preceded animal life,
and that the former was necessarily dependent upon the latter.  The existence of races of men
inhabiting the icy regions of the North Polar lands, and whose nutriment is solely derived
from fish and cetaceans, shows the possibility of maintaining life independently of vegetable
substances.  After the devonian system and the mountain limestone, we come to a formation,
the botanical analysis of which has made such brilliant advances in modern times.*

The coal measures contain not only fern-like cryptogamic plants and phanerogamic monocotyledons
(grasses, yucc-like Liliaceae and palms), but also gymnospermic dicotyledons (Coniferae and
Cycadeae), amounting in all to nearly 400 species, as characteristic of the coal formations.
Of these we will only enumerate arborescent Calamites and Lycopodiaceae, scaly Lepidodendra,
Sigillariae, which attain a height of sixty feet, and are sometimes found standing upright,
being distinguished by a double system of vascular bundles, cactus-like Stigmariae, a great
number of ferns, in some cases the stems, and in others the fronds alone being found, indicating
by their abundance the insular form of the dry land,* Cycadeae** especially palms, although
fewer in number.***

E'Urville, 'De la Distribution des Fougeres sur la Surface du Globe Terrestre'.

[footnote]  **Such are the Cycadeae discovered by Count Sternberg in the old carboniferous
formation at Radnitz, in Bohemia, and described by Corda (two species of Cycatides and Zamites
Cordai.  See Goppert, 'Fossile Cycadeen in den Arbeiten der Schles. Gesellschaft, fur waterl.
Cultur im Jahr' 1843, s. 33, 37, 40 and 50).  A Cycadea (Pterophyllum gonorchachis, Gopp.)
has also been found in the carboniferous formations in Upper Silesia, at Konigshutte.

[footnote]  ***Lindley, 'Fossil Flora', No. xv., p. 163.

Asterophyllites, having whorl-like leaves, and allied to the Naiades, with araucaria-like Coniferae',*
which exhibit faint traces of annual rings.

[footnote]  *'Fossil Coniferae', in Buckland's 'Geology', p. 483-490. Witham has the great
merit of having first recognized the existence of Coniferae in the early vegetation of the
old carboniferous formation. Almost all the trunks of trees found in this formation were previously
regarded as palms.  The species of the genus 'Araucaria' are, however, not peculiar to the
coal formations of the British Islands; they likewise occur in Upper Silesia.

This difference of character from our present vegtation, minifested in the vegetative forms
which were so luxuriously developed on the drier p 280 and more elevated portions of the old
red sandstone, was maintained through all the subsequent epochs to the most recent chalk formations;
amid the peculiar characteristics exhibited in the vegetable forms contained in the coal measures,
there is, however, a strikingly-marked prevalence of the same families, if not of the same
species,* in all parts of the earth as it then existed, as in New Holland, Canada, Greenland,
and Melville Island.

[footnote[  *Adolphe Brongniart, 'Prodrome d'une Hist. des Vegetaux Fossiles', p. 179; buckland,
'Geology', p. 479; Endlicher and Unger, 'Grundzuge der Botanik', 1843, s. 455.

The vegetation of the primitive period exhibits forms which, from their simultaneous affinity
with several families of the present world, testify that many intermediate links must have
become extinct in the scale of organic development.  Thus, for example, to mention only two
instances, we would notice the Lepidodendra, which, according to Lindley, occupy a place between
the Coniferae and the Lycopodiaceae*, and the Araucariae and pines, which exhibit some peculiarities
in the union of their vascular bundles.

[footnote]  *"By means of Lepidodendron, a better passage is established from flowering to
flowerless plants than by either Equisetum or Cycas, or any other known genus." -- Lindley
and Hutton, 'Fossil Flora', vol. ii., p. 53.

Even if we limit our consideration to the present world alone, we must regard as highly important
the discovery of Cycadeae and Coniferae side by side with Sagenariae and Lepidodendra in the
ancient coal measures.  The Coniferae are not ony allied to Cupuliferae and Betulinae, with
which we find them associated in lignite formations, but also with Lycopodiaceae. The family
of the sago-like Cycadeae approaches most nearly to palms in its external appearance, while
these plants are specially allied to Coniferae in respect to the structure of their blossoms
and seed.*

[footnote]  *Kunth, 'Anordnung der Pflanzenfamilien', in his 'Handb. der Botanik', s. 307 und 314.

Where many beds of coal are superposed over one another, the families and species are not always
blended, being most frequently grouped together in separate genera; Lycopodiaceae and certain
ferns being alone found in one bed, and Stigmariae and Sigillariae in another.  In order to
give some idea of the luxuriance of the vegetation of the primitive world, and of the immense
masses of vegetable matter which was doubtlessly accumulated in currents and converted in a
moist condition into coal,* I would instance the Saarbrucker coal measures, p 281 where 120
beds are superposed on one another, exclusive of a great many which are less than a foot in
thickness; the coal beds at Johnstone, in Scotland, and those in the Creuzot, in Burgundy,
are some of them, respectively, thirty and fifty feet in thickness,** while in the forests
of our temperate zones, the carbon contained in the trees growing over a certain area would
hardly suffice, in the space of a hundred years, to cover it with more than a stratum of seven
French lines in thickness.***

[footnote]  That coal has not been formed from vegetable fibers charred by fire, but that it
has more probably been produced in the moist way by the action of sulphuric acid, is strikingly
demonstrated by the excellent observation made by Goppert (Karsten, 'Archiv fu Mineralogie',
bd. xviii., s. 530), on the conversion of a fragment of amber-tree into black coal.  The coal
and the unaltered amber lay side by side.  Regarding the part which the lower forms of vegetation
may have had in the formation of coal beds, see Link, in the 'Abhandl. der Berliner Akademie
der Wissenschaften', 1838, s. 38.

[footnote]  **[The actual total thickness of the different beds in England varies considerably
in different districts, but appears to amount in the Lancashire coal field to as much as 150
feet. -- Ansted's 'Ancient World', p. 78.  For an enumeration of the thickness of coal measures
in America and the Old Continent, see Mantell's 'Wonders of Geology', vol. ii., p. 60.] -- Tr.

[footnote]  ***See the accurate labors of Chevandier, in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Academie
des Sciences', 1844, t. xviii., Part i., p. 285.  In comparing this bed of carbon, seven lines
in thickness, with beds of coal, we must not omit to consider the enormous pressure to which
the latter have been subjected from superimposed rock, and which manifests itself in the flattened
form of the stems of the trees found in these subterranean regions.  "The so-called 'wood-hills'
discovered in 1806 by Sirowatskoi, on the south coast of the island of New Siberia, consist,
according to Hedenstrom, of horizontal strata of sandstone, aolternating with bituminous trunks
of trees, forming a mound thirty fathoms in neight; at the summit the stems were in a vertical
position.  The bed of driftwood is visible at five wersts' distance." -- See Wrangel, 'Reise
Iangs der Nordkuste von Siberien, in den Jahren' 1820-24, th. i., s. 102.

Near the mouth of the Mississippi, and in the "wood hills" of the Siberian Polar Sea, described
by Admiral Wrangel, the vast number of trunks of trees accumulated by river and sea water currents
affords a striking instance of theenormous quantities of drift-wood which must have favored
the formation of carboniferous deposition in the island waters and insular bays.  There can
be no doubt that these beds owe a considerable portion of the substances of which they consist
to grasses, small branching shrubs, and cryptogamic plants.

The association of palms and Coniferae, which we have indicated as being characteristic of
the coal formations, is discoverable throughout almost all formations to the tertiary period.
In the present condition of the world, these genera p 282 appear to exhibit no tendency whatever
to occur associated together.  We have so accustomed ourselves, although erroneously, to regard
Coniferae as a northern form, that I experienced a feeling of surprise when, in ascending from
the shores of the South Pacific toward Chilpansingo and the elevated valleys of Mexico, between
the 'Venta de la Moxonera' and the 'Alto de los Caxones', 4000 feet above the level of the
sea, I rode a whole day through a dense wood of Pinus occidentalis, where I observed that these
trees, which are so similar to the Weymouth pine, were associated with fan palms* ('Corypha
dulcis'), swarming with brightly-colored parrots.

[[footnote]  *This corypha is the 'soyate' (in Aztec, zoyatl), or the 'Palma dulce' of the
natives.  See Humboldt and Bonplaud, 'Synopsis Plant. AEquinoct. Orbis Novi', t. i., p. 302.
Professor Buschmann, who is profoundly acquainted with the American languages, remarks, that
the 'Palma soyate' is so named in Yepe's 'Vocabulario de la Lengua Othomi', and that the Aztec
word zoyatl (Molina, 'Vocabulario en Lengua Mexicana y Castellana', p. 25) recurs in names
of places, such as Zoyatitlan and Zoyapanco, near Chiapa.

South America has oaks, but not a single species of pine; and the first time that I again saw
the familiar form of a fir-tree, it was thus associated with the strange appearance of the
fan palm.*

[footnote]  *Near Baracoa and Cayos de Moya.  Columbus, who invariably paid the most remarkable
attention to all natural objects, was the first to observe the difference between 'Podocarpus'
and 'Pinus'.  "I find," said he, "en la tierra aspera del Cibao pinos que no Ilevan pinas (fir
cones), pero portal orden compuestos por naturaleza, que (los frutos) parecen azeytunas del
Axarafe de Sevilla."  The great botanist, Richard, when he published his excellent Memoir on
Cycadeae and Coniferae, little imagined that before the time of L'Heritier, and even before
the end of the fifteenth century, a navigator had separated 'Podocarpus' from the Abietineae.

Christopher Columbus, in his first voyage of discovery, saw Coniferae and palms growing together
on the northeastern extremity of the island of Cuba, likewise within the tropics, and scarcely
above the level of the sea.  This acute observer, whom nothing escaped, mentions the fact in
his journal as a remarkable circumstance, and his friend Anghiera, the secretary of Frdinand
the Catholic, remarks with astonishment "that 'palmeta' and 'pineta' are found associated together
in the newly-discovered land."  It is a matter of much importance to geology to compare the
present distribution of plants over the earth's surface with that exhibited in the fossil floras
of the primitive world.  The temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, which is so rich in
seas and islands, and where p 283 tropical forms blend so remarkably with those of colder parts
of the earth, presents according to Darwin's beautiful and animated descriptions,* the most
instructive materials for the study of the present and the past geography of plants.

[footnote]  *Charles Darwin, 'Journal of the Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle', 1839, p. 271.

The history of the primordial ages is, in the strict sense of the word, a part of the history
of plants.

Cycadeae, which, from the number of their fossil species, must have occupied a far more important
part in the extinct than in the present vegetable world, are associated with the nearly allied
Coniferae from the coal formations upward.  They are almost wholly absent in the epoch of the
variegated sandstone which contains Coniferae of rare and luxuriant structure ('Voltizia, Haidingera,
Albertia'); the Cycadeae, however, occur most frequently in the keuper and lias strata, in
which more than twenty different forms appear.  In the chalk, marine plants and naiades predominate.
The forests of Cycadeae of the Jura formations had, therefore, long disappeared, and even in
the more ancient tertiary formations they are quite subordinate to the Coniferae and palms.*

[footnote]  *Goppert describes three other Cycadeae (species of Cycadites and Pterophyllum),
found in the brown carboniferous schistose clay of Alt-sattel and Commotau, in Bohemia.  They
very probably belong to the Eocene Period.  Goppert, 'Fossile Cycadeen', s. 61.

The lignites, or beds of brown coal* which are present in all divisions of the tertiary period,
present, among the most ancient cryptogamic land plants, some few palms, many Coniferae having
distinct annual rings, and foliaceous shrubs of a more or less tropical character.

[footnote]  *['Medals of Creation', vol. i., ch. v., etc.  'Wonders of Geology', vol. i., p.
278, 392.] -- Tr.

In the middle tertiary period we again find palms and Cycadeae fully established, and finally
a great similarity with our existing flora, manifested in the sudden and abundant occurrence
of our pines and firs, Cupuliferae, maples, and poplars.  The dicotyledonous stems found in
lignite are occasionally distinguished by colossal size and great age.  In the trunk of a tree
found at Bonn, Noggerath counted 792 annual rings.*

[footnote]  *Buckland, 'Geology', p. 509.

In the north of France, at Yseux, near Abbeville, oaks have been discovered in the turf moors
of the Somme which measured fourteen feet in diameter, a thickness which is very remarkable
in the Old Continent and without the tropics.  According to Goppert's excellent investigations,
which, it is hoped, may soon be illustrated by plates, it would appear that "all the amber
of the Baltic comes from p 284 a coniferous tree, which, to judge by the still extant remains
of wood and the bark at different ages, approaches very nearly to our white and red pines,
although forming a distinct species. The amber-tree of the ancient world ('Pinites succifer')
abounded in resin to a degree far surpassing that manifested by any extant coniferous tree;
for not only were large masses of amber deposited in and upon the bark, but also in the wood
itself, following the course of the medullary rays, which, together with ligneous cells, are
still discernible under the microscope, and peripherally between the rings, being some times
both yellow and white."

"Among the vegetable forms inclosed in amber are male and femald blossoms of our native needle-wood
trees and Cupuliferae, while fragments which are recognized as belonging to thuia, cupressus,
ephedera, and castania vesca, blended with those of junipers and firs, indicate a vegetation
different from that of the coasts and plains of the Baltic."*

[footnote]  *{The forests of amber-pines, 'Pinites succifer', were in the southeastern part
of what is now the bed of the Baltic, in about 55 degrees N. lat., and 37 degrees E. long.
The different colors of amber are derived from local chemical admixture.  The amber contains
fragments of vegetable matter, and from these it has been ascertained tht the amber-pine forests
contained four other species of pine (besides the 'Pinites succier'), several cypresses, yews,
and junipers, with oaks, poplars, beeches, etc. -- altogether forty-eight species of trees
and shrubs, constituting a flora of North American chracter.    There are also some ferns,
mosses, fungi, and liverworts.  See Professor Goppert, 'Geol. Trans.', 1845.  Insects, spiders,
small crustaceans, leaves, and fragments of vegetable tissue, are imbedded in some of the masses.
Upward of 800 species of insects have been observed; most of them belong to species, and even
genera, that appear to be distinct from any now known, but others are nearly related to indigenous
species, and some are identical with existing forms, that inhabit more southern climes. --
'Wonders of Geology', vol. i., p. 242, etc.] -- Tr.

We have now passed through the whole series of formations comprised in the geological portion
of the present work, proceeding from the oldest erupted rock and the most ancient sedimentary
formations to the alluvial land on which are scattered those large masses of rock, the causes
of whose general distribution have been so long and variously discussed, and which are, in
my opinion, to be ascribed rather to the penetration and violent outpouring of pent-up waters
by the elevation of mountain chains than to the motion of floating blocks of ice.*

[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, in the 'Abhandl. der Akad. der Wissensch. zu Berlin', 1814-15,
s. 161; and in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. ix., s. 575; Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Annales des
Sciences Naturelles', t. xix., p. 60.

The most ancient structures of the transition formation p 285 with which we are acquainted
are slate and graywacke, which contain some remains of sea weeds from the silurian or cambrian
sea.  On what did these so-called 'most ancient' formations rest, if gneiss and mica schist
must be regarded as changed sedimentary strata?  Dare we hazard a conjecture on that which
can not be an object of actual geognostic observation?  According to an ancient Indian myth,
the earth is borne up by an elephant, who in his turn is supported by a gigantic tortoise,
in order that he may not fall; but it is not permitted to the credulous Brahmins to inquire
on what the tortoise rests.  We venture here upon a somewhat similar problem, and are prepared
to meet with opposition in our endeavors to arrive at its soluion. In the first formation of
the planets, as we stated in the astronomical portion of this work, it is probable that nebulous
rings revolving round the sun were agglomerated into spheroids, and consolidated by a gradual
condensation proceeding from the exterior toward the center.  What we term the ancient silurian
strata are thus only the upper portions of the solid crust of the earth.  The erupted rocks
which have broken through and upheaved these strata have been elevated from depths that are
wholly inaccessible to our research; they must, therefore, have existed under the silurian
strata, and been composed of the same association of minerals which we term granite, augite,
and quartzose porphyry, when they are made known to us by eruption through the surface.  Basing
our inquiries on analogy, we may assume that the substances which fill up deep fissures and
traverse the sedimentary strata are merely the ramifications of a lower deposit.  The foci
of active volcanoes are situated at enormous depths, and judging from the remarkable fragments
which I have found in various parts of the earth incrusted in lava currents, I should deem
it more than probable tht a primordial granite rock forms the substratum of the whole stratified
edifice of fossil remains.*

[footnote]  *See Elie de Beaumont, 'Descr. Geol. de la France', t. i., p. 65; Beaudant, 'Geologie',
1844, p. 269.

Basalt containing olivine first shows itself in the period of the chalk trachyte still later,
while eruptions of granite belong, as we learn from the products of their metamorphic action
to the epoch of the oldest sedimentary strata of the transition formation.  Where knowledge
can not be attained from immediate perceptive evidence, we may be allowed from induction, no
less than from a careful comparison of facts, to hazard a conjecture by which granite would
be restored p 286 to a portion of its contested right and title to be considered as a 'primordial'
rock.

The recent progress of geognosy, that is to say, the more extended knowledge of the geognostic
epochs characterized by differences of mineral formations, by the peculiarities and succession
of the organisms contained within them, and by the position of the strata, whether uplifted
or inclined horizontally, leads us, by means of the causal connection existing among all natural
phenomena, to the distribution of solids and fluids into the continents and seas which constitute
the upper crust of our planet.  We here touch upon a point of contact between geological and
geographical geognosy which would constitute the complete history of the form and extent of
continents.  The limitation of the solid by the fluid parts of the earth's surface and their
mutual relations of area, have varied very considerably in the long series of geognostic epochs.
They were very different, for instance, when carboniferous strata were horizontally deposited
on the inclined beds of the mountain limestone and old red sandstone; when lias and oolite
lay on a substratum of keuper and muschelkalk, and the chalk rested on the slopes of green
sandstone and Jura limestone.  If, with Elie de Beaumont, we term the waters in which the Jura
limestone and chalk formed a soft deposit the 'Jurassic or oolitic', and the 'cretaceous seas',
the outlines of these formations will indicate, for the two corresponding epochs, the boundaries
between the already dried land and the ocean in which these rocks were forming.  An ingenious
attempt has been made to craw maps of this physical portion of primitive geography and we may
consider such diagrams as more correct than those of the wanderings of Io or the Homeric geography,
since the latter are merely graphic representations of mythical images, while the former are
based upon positive facts deduced from the science of geology.

The results of the investigations made regarding the areal relations of the solid portions
of our planet are as follows:  in the most ancient times, during the silurian and devonian
transition epochs, and in the secondary formations, including the trias, the continental portions
of the earth were limited to insular groups covered with vegetation; these islands at a subsequent
period became united, giving rise to numerous lakes and deeply-indented bays; and finally,
when the chains of the Pyrenees, Apennines, and Carpathian Mountains were elevated about the
period of the more ancient tertiary formations, large continents appeared, having almost their
present p 287 size.*

[footnote]  *[These movements, described in so few words, were doubtless going on for many
thousands and tens of thousands of revolutions of our planet.  They were accompanied, also,
by vast but slow changes of other kinds.  The expansive force employed in lifting up, by mighty
movements, the northern portion of the continent of Asia, found partial vent; and from partial
subsqueous fissures there were poured out the tabular masses of basalt occurring in Central
India, while an extensive area of depression in the Indian Ocean, marked by the coral islands
of the Laccadives, the Maldives, the great Chagos Bank, and some others, were in the course
of depression by a counteracting movement. -- Ansted's 'Ancient World', p. 346, etc.] -- Tr.

In the silurian epoch, as well as in that in which the Cycadeae flourished in such abundance,
and gigantic saurians were living, the dry land, from pole to pole, was probably less than
it now is in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.  We shall see, in a subsequent part of
this work, how this preponderating quantity of water, combined with other causes, must have
contributed to raise the temperature and induce a greater uniformity of climate.  Here we would
only remark in considering the gradual extension of the dry land, that, shortly before the
'disturbances' which at longer or shorter intervals caused the sudden destruction of so great
a number of colossal vertebrata in the 'diluvial period', some parts of the present continental
masses must have been completely separated from one another. There is a great similarity in
South America and Australia between still living and extinct species of animals.  In New Holland,
fossil remains of the kangaroo have been found, and in New Zealand the semi-foxxilized bones
of an enormous bird, resembling the ostrich, the dinornis of Owen,* which is nearly allied
to the present spteryx, and but little so to the recently extinct dronte (dodo) of the island
of Rodriguez.

[[footnote]  *[See 'American Journal of Science', vol. xiv., p. 187; and 'Medals of Creation',
vol. ii., p. 817; 'Trans. Zoolog. Society of London', vol. ii; 'Wonders of Geology', vol. i.,
p. 129.] -- Tr.

The form of the continental portions of the earth may, perhaps, in a great measure, owe their
elevation above the surrounding level of the water to the eruption of quartzose porphyry, which
overthrew with violence the first great vegetation from which the matrial of our present coal
measures was formed.  The portions of the earth's surface which we term plains are nothing
more than the broad summits of hills and mountains whose bases rest on the bottom of the ocean.
Every plain is, therefore, when considered according to its submarine relations, an 'elevated
plateau', whose inequalities have been covered over by horizontal deposition of new sedimentary
formations and by the accumulation of alluvium.

p 288 Among the general subjects of contemplation appertaining to a work of this nature, a
prominent place must be given, first, in the consideration of the 'quantity' of the land raised
above the level of the sea, and next, to the individual configuration of each part, either
in relation to horizontal extension (relations of form) or to vertical elevation (hypsometrical
relations of mountain-chains).  Our planet has two envelopes, of which one, which is general
-- the atmosphere -- is composed of an elastic fluid, and the other -- the sea -- is only locally
distributed, surrounding, and therefore modifying, the form of the land.  These two envelopes
of air and sea constitute a natural whole, on which depend the difference of climate on the
earth's surface, according to the relative extension of the aqueous and solid parts, the form
and aspect of the land, and the direction and elevation of mountain chains.  A knowledge of
the reciprocal action of air, sea, and land teaches us that great meteorological phenomena
can not be comprehended when considered independently of geognostic relations. Meteorology,
as well as the geography of plants and animals, has only begun to make actual progress since
the mutual dependence of the phenomena to be investigated has been fully recognized.  The word
climate has certainly special reference to the character of the atmosphere, but this character
is itself dependent on the perpetually concurrent influences of the ocean, which is universally
and deeply agitated by currents having a totally opposite temperature, and of radiation from
the dry land, which varies greatly in form, elevation, color, and fertility, whether we consider
its bare, rocky portions, or those that are covered with arborescent or herbaceous vegetation.

In the present condition of the surface of our planet, the area of the solid is to that of
the fluid parts as 1:2 4/5ths (according to Rigaud, as 100:270).*

[footnote]  *See 'Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society', vcl. vi., Part ii.,
1837, p. 297.  Other writers have given the ratio as 100:284.

The islands form scarcely 1/22d of the continental masses, which are so unequally divided that
they consist of three times more land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere; the
latter being, therefore, pre-eminently oceanic.  From 40 degrees south latitude to the Antarctic
pole the earth is almost entirely covered with water.  The fluid element predominates in like
manner between the eastern shores of the Old and the western shores of the New Continent, being
only interspersed with some few insular groups.  The learned hydrographer Fleurieu has very
justly named this p 289 vast oceanic basis, which, under the tropics, extends over 145¼degrees
of longitude, the 'Great Ocean', in contradistinction to all other seas.  The southern and
western hemispheres (reckoning the latter from the meridian of Teneriffe) are therefore more
rich in water than in any other region of the whole earth.

These are the main points involved in the consideration of the relative quantity of land and
sea, a relation which exercises so important an influence on the distribution of temperature,
the variations in atmospheric pressure, the direction of the winds, and the quantity of moisture
contained in the air, with which the development of vegetation is so essentially connected.
When we consider that nearly three fourths of the upper surface of our planet are covered with
water,* we shall be less surprised at the imperfect condition of meteorology before the beginning
of the present century, since it is only during the subsequent period that numerous accurate
observations on the temperature of the sea at different latitudes and at different seasons
have been made and numerically compared together.

[footnote]  *In the Middle Ages, the opinion prevailed that the sea covered one seventh of
the surface of the globe, an opinion which Cardinal d'Ailly ('Imago Mundi', cap. 8) founded
on the fourth apocryphal book of Esdras. Columbus, who derived a great portion of his cosmographical
knowledge from the cardinal's work, was much interested in upholding this idea of the smallness
of the sea, to which the misunderstood expression of "the ocean stream" contributed not a little.

The horizontal configuration of continents in their general relations of extension was already
made a subject of intellectual contemplation by the ancient Greeks.  Conjectures were advanced
regarding the maximum of the extension from west to east, and Dicaearchus placed it, according
to the testimony of Agathemerus, in the latitude of Rhodes, in the direction of a line passing
from the Pillars of Hercules to Thine.  This line, which has been termed 'the parallel of the
diaphragm of Dicaearchus', is laid down with an astronomical accuracy of position, which, as
I have stated in another work, is well worthy of exciting surprise and admiration.*

[footnote]  *Agathemerus, in Hudson, 'Geographi Minores', t. ii., p. 4.  See Humboldt, 'Asie
Centr.', t. i., p. 120-125.

Strabo, who was probably influenced by Eratosthenes, appears to have been so firmly convinced
that this parallel of 36 degrees was the maximum of the extension of the then existing world,
that he supposed it had some intimate connection with the form of the earth, and therefore
places under this line the continent whose existence p 290 he divined in the northern hemisphere,
between Theria and the coasts of Thine.*

[footnote]  *Strabo, lib. i., p. 65, Casaub.  See Humboldt, 'Examen Crit.', t. i., p. 152.

As we have already remarked, one hemisphere of the earth (whether we divide the sphere through
the equator or through the meridian of Teneriffe) has a much greater expansion of elevated
land than the opposite one:  these two vast ocean-girt tracts of land, which we term the eastern
and western, or the Old and New Continents, present, however, conjointly with the most striking
contrasts of configuration and position of their axes, some similarities of form, especially
with reference to the mutual relations of their opposite coasts.  In the eastern continent,
the predominating direction -- the position of the major axis -- inclines from east to west
(or, more correctly speaking, from southwest to northeast), while in the western continent
it inclines from south to north (or, rather, from south-southeast to north-northwest).  Both
terminate to the north at a parallel coinciding nearly with that of 70¼degrees, while they
extend to the south in pyramidal points, having submarine prolongations of islands and shoals.
Such, for instance, are the Archipelago of Tierra del Fuego, the Lagullas Bank south of the
Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen's Land, separated from New Holland by Bass's Straits.  Northern
Asia extends to the above parallel at Cape Taimura, which, according to Krusenstern, is 78
degrees 16', while it falls below it from the mouth of the Great Tschukotsehja River eastward
to Behring's Straits, in the eastern extremity of Asia -- Cook's East Cape -- which, according
to Beechey, is only 66 degrees E.*

[footnote]  *On the mean latitude of the Northern Asiatic shores, and the true name of Cape
Taimura (Cape Siewere-Wostotschnoi), and Cape Northeast (Schalagskoi Mys), see Humboldt, 'Asie
Centrale', t. iii., p. 35, 37.

The northern shore of the New Continent follows with tolerable exactness the parallel of 70
degrees, since the lands to the north and south of Barrow's Strait, from Boothia Felix and
Victoria Land, are merely detached islands.

The pyramidal configuration of all the southern extremities of continents belongs to the 'similtudines
physicae in configuratione mundi', to which Bacon already called attention in his 'Novum Organon',
and with which Reinhold Foster, one of Cook's companions in his second voyage of circumnavigation,
connected some ingenious considerations.  On looking eastward from the meridian of Teneriffe,
we perceive that the southern extremities of the three continents, viz., Africa as the extreme
p 291 of the Old World, Australia, and South America, successively approach nearer toward the
south pole.  New Zealand, whose length extends fully 12 degrees of latitude, forms an intermediate
link between Australia and South America, likewise terminating in an island, New Leinster.
It is also a remarkable circumstance that the greatest extension toward the south falls in
the Old Continent, under the same meridian in which the extremest projection toward the north
pole is manifested.  This will be perceived on comparing the Cape of Good Hope and the Lagullas
Bank with the North Cape of Europe, and the peninsula of Malacca with Cape Taimura in Siberia.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 198-200.  The southern point of America,
and the Archipelago which we call Terra del Fuego, lie in the meridian of the northwestern
part of Baffin's Bay, and of the great polar land, whose limits have not as yet been ascertained,
and which, perhaps, belongs to West Greenland.

We know not whether the poles of the earth are surrounded by land or by a sea of ice.  Toward
the north pole the parallel of 82 degrees 55' has been reached, but toward the south pole only
that of 78 degrees 10'.

The pyramidal terminations of the great continents are variously repeated on a smaller scale,
not only in the Indian Ocean and in the peninsulas of Arabia, Hindostan, and Malacca, but also,
as was remarked by Eratosthenes and Polybius, in the Mediterranean, where these writers had
ingeniously compared together the forms of the Iberian, Italian, and Hellenic peninsulas.*

[footnote]  *Strabo, lib. ii., p. 92, 108, Cassaub.

Europe, whose area is five times smaller than that of Asia, may almost be regarded as a multifariously
articulated western peninsula of the more compact mass of the ontinent of Asia, the climatic
relations of the former being to those of the latter as the peninsula of Brittany is to the
rest of France.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 25.  As early as the year 1817, in my work
'De distributione Geographica Plantarum, secundum caels temperiem et altitudinem Montium',
I directed attention to the important influence of compact and of deeply-articulated continents
on climate and human civilization, "Regiones vel per sinus lunatos in longa cornua porrectae,
angulois littorum recessibus quasi membratim discerptae, vel spatia patentia in immensum, quorum
littora nullis incisa angulis ambit sine aufractu oceanus" (p. 81, 182).  On the relations
of the extent of coast to the area of a continent (considered in some degree as a measure of
the accessibility of the interior), see the inquiries in Berghaus, 'Annalen der Erdkunde',
bd. xii., 1835, s. 490, and 'Physikal. Atlas', 1839, No. iii., s. 69.

The influence exercised by the articulation and higher development of the form of a continent
on the moral and intellectual condition of nations was remarked by Strabo,* who extols p 292
the varied form of our small continent as a special advantage.

[footnote]  *Strabo, lib. ii., p. 92, 198. Casaub.

Africa* and South America, which manifest so great a resemblence in their configuration, are
also the two continents that exhibit the simplest littoral outlines.

[footnote]  *Of Africa, Pliny says (v. 1), "Nec alia pars terrarum paudiores recipit sinus."
The small Indian peninsula on this side the Ganges present, in its triangular outline, a third
analogous form.  In ancient Greece there prevailed an opinion of the regular configuration
of the dry land.  There were four gulfs or bays, among which the Persian Gulf was placed in
opposition to the Hyrcanian or Caspian Sea (Arrian, vii., 16; Plut., 'in vita Alexandri', cap.
44; Dionys. Perieg., v. 48 and 630, p. 11, 38, Bernh.).  These four bays and the isthmuses
were, according to the optical fancies of Agesianax, supposed to be reflected in the moon (Plut.,
'de Facie in Orbem Lunae', p. 921, 19).  Respecting the 'terra quadrifida', or four divisions
of the dry land, of which two lay north and two south of the equator, see Macrobius, 'Comm.
in Somnium Scipionis', ii., 9.  I have submitted this portion of the geography of the ancients,
regarding which great confusion prevails, to a new and careful examination, in my 'Examen Crit.
de l'Hist. de la Geogr.', t. i., p. 119, 145, 180-185, as also in 'Asie Centr.', t. ii., p.
172-178.

It is only the eastern shores of Asia, which, broken as it were by the force of the currents
of the ocean* ('fractas ex aequore terra'), exhibit a richly-variegated configuration, peninsulas
and contiguous islands alternating from the equator to 60 degrees north latitude.

[footnote]  *Fleurieu, in 'Voyage de Marchand autour du Monde', t. iv., p. 38-42.

Our Atlantic Ocean presents all the indications of a valley.  It is as if a flow of eddying
waters had been directed first toward the northeast, then toward the northwest, and back again
to the northeast.  The parallelism of the coasts north of 10 degrees south latitude, the projecting
and receding angles, the convexity of Brazil opposite to the Gulf of Guinea, that of Africa
under the same parallel, with the Gulf of the Antilles, all favor this apparently speculative
view.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, in the 'Journal de Physique', liii., 1799, p. 33; and 'Rel. Hist.',
t. ii., p. 19; t. iii., p. 189, 198.

In this Atlantic valley, as is almost every where the case in the
configuration of large continental masses, coasts deeply indented, and rich
in islands, are situated opposite to those possessing a different character.
 I long since drew attention to the geognostic importance of entering into a
comparison of the western coast of Africa and of South America within the
tropics.  The deeply curved indentation of the African continent at Fernando
Po, 4 degrees 30' north latitude, is repeated on the coast of the Pacific at
18 degrees 15' south latitude, between the Valley of Arica and the Morro de
Juan Diaz, where the Peruvian coast suddenly changes the direction from
wouth to north which it had previously followed, and inclines to the
northwest.  This change
p 293
of direction extends in like manner to the chain of the Andes, which is
divided into two parallel branches affecting not only the littoral
portions,* but even the eastern Cordilleras.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, in Poggendorf's 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xl., s. 171.  On the remarkable
fiord formation at the southeast end of America, see Darwin's Journal ('Narrative of the Voyages
of the Adventure and Beagle', vol. iii.), 1839, p. 266.  The parallelism of the two mountain
chains is maintained from 5 degrees north latitude.  The change in the direction of the coast
at Arica appears to be in consequence of the altered course of the fissure, above which the
Cordillera of the Andes has been upheaved.

In the latter, civilization had its earliest seat in the South American plateaux where the
small Alpine lake of Titicaca bathes the feet of the colossal mountains of Sorata and Illimani.
Further to the south, from Valdiva and Chilo (40 degrees to 42 degrees south latitude), through
the Archipelago 'de los Chonos' to 'Terra del Fuego', we find repeated that singular configuration
of 'fiords' (a blending of narrow and deeply-indented bays), which in the Northern hemisphere
characterizes the western shores of Norway and Scotland.

These are the most general considerations suggested by the study of the upper surface of our
planet with reference to the form of continents, and their expansion in a horizontal direction.
We have collected facts and brought forward some analogies of configuration in distant parts
of the earth, but we do not venture to regard them as fixed laws of form.  When the traveler
on the declivity of an active volcano, as, for instance, of Vesuvius, examines the frequent
partial elevations by which portions of the soil are often permanently upheaved several feet
above their former level, either immediately precediing or during the continuance of an eruption,
thus forming roof-like or flattened summits, he is taught how accidental conditions in the
expression of the force of subterranean vapors, and in the resistance to be overcome, may modify
the feeble perturbations in the equilibrium of the internal elastic forces of our planet may
have inclined them more to its norther than to its southern direction, and caused the continent
in the eastern part of the globe to present a broad mass, whose major axis is almost parallel
with the equator, while in the western and more oceanic part the southern extremity is extremely
narrow.

Very little can be empirically determined regarding the causal connection of the phenomena
of the formation of continents, or of the analogies and contrasts presented by their p 294
configuration.  All that we know regarding this subject resolves itself into this one point,
that the active cause is subterranean; that continents did not arise at once in the form they
now present, but were, as we have already observed, increased by degrees by means of numerous
oscillatory elevations and depressions of the soil, or were formed by the fusion of separate
smaller continental masses.  Their present form is, therefore, the result of two causes, which
have exercised a consecutive action the one on the other; the first is the expression of subterranean
force, whose direction we term accidental, owing to our inability to defint it, from its removal
from within the sphere of our comprehension, while the second is derived from forces acting
on the surface, among which volcanic eruptions, the elevation of mountains, and currents of
sea water play the principal parts.  How totally different would be the condition of the temperature
of the earth, and consequently, of the state of vegetation, husbandry, and human society, if
the major axis of the New Continent had the same direction as that of the Old Continent; if,
for instance, the Cordilleras, instead of having a southern direction, inclined from east to
west; if there had been no radiating tropical continent, like Africa, to the south of Europe;
and if the Mediterranean, which was once connected with the Caspian and Red Seas, and which
has become so powerful a means of furthering the intercommunication of nations, had never existed,
or if it had been elevated like the plains of Lombardy and Cyrene?

The changes of the reciprocal relations of height between the fluid and solid portions of the
earth's surface (changes which, at the same time, determine the outlines of continents, and
the greater or lesser submersion of low lands) are to be ascribed to numerous unequally working
causes.  The most powerful have incontestably been the force of elastic vapors inclosed in
the interior of the earth, the sudden change of temperature of certain dense strata,* the unequal
secular loss of p 295 heat experienced by the crust and nucleus of the earth, occasioning ridges
in the solid surface, local modifications of gravitation,** and, as a consequence of these
alterations, in the curvature of a portion of the liquid element.

[footnote]  *De la Beche, 'Sections and Views illustrative of Geological Phenomena', 1830,
tab. 40; Charles Babbage, 'Observations on the Temple of Serapis at Pozzuoli, near Naples,
and on certain Causes which may produce Geological Cycles of great Extent', 1834.  "If a stratum
of sandstone five miles in thickness should have its temperature raised about 100 degrees,
its surface would rise twenty-five feet.  Heated beds of clay would, on the contrary, occasion
a sinking of the ground by their contraction."  See Bischof, 'Wurmelehre des Innern unseres
Erdkorpers', s. 303, concerning the calculations for the secular elevation of Sweden, on the
supposition of a rise by so small a quantity as 7 degrees in a stratum of about 155,000 feet
in thickness, and heated to a state of fusion.

[footnote]  **The opinion so implicitly entertained regarding the invariability of the force
of gravity at any given point of the earth's surface, has in some degree been controverted
by the gradual rise of large portions of the earth's surface.  See Bessel, 'Ueber Maas und
Gewicht', in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1840, s. 134.

According to the views generally adopted by geognosists in the present day and which are supported
by the observation of a series of well-attested facts, no less than by analogy with the most
important volcanic phenomena, it would appear that the elevation of continents is actual, and
not merely apparent or owing to the configuration of the upper surface of the sea.  The merit
of having advanced this view beloongs to Leopold von Buch, the narrative of his memorable 'Travels
through Norway and Sweden' in 1806 and 1807.*

[footnnote]  *Th. ii. (1810), s. 389.  See Hallstrom, in 'Kongl. Vetenskaps-Academiens Handlingar'
(Stockh.), 1823, p. 30; Lyell in the 'Philos. Trans.' for 1835; Blom (Amtmann in Budskerud),
'Stat. Beschr. von Norwegen',1843, s. 89-116.  If not before Von Buch's travels through Scandinavia,
at any rate before their publication, Playfair, in 1802, in his illustrations of the Huttonian
theory, ¤ 393, and according to Keilhau ('Om Landjardens Stigning in Norge', in the 'Nyt Magazine
fur Naturvidenskaberne'), and the Dane Jessen, even before the time of Playfair, had expressed
the opinion that it was not the sea which was sinking, but the solid land of Sweden which was
rising.  Their ideas, however, were wholly unknown to our great geologist, and exerted no influence
on 'Norge fremstillet efter dets naturlige og borgerlige Tilstand', Kjobenh., 1763, sought
to explain the causes of the changes in the relative levels of the land and sea, basing his
views on the early calculations of Celsius, Kalm, and Dalin.  He broaches some confused ideas
regarding the possibility of an internal growth of rocks, but finally declares himself in favor
of an upheaval of the land by earthquakes, "although," he observes, "no such rising was apparent
immediately after the earthquake of Egersund, yet the earthquake may have opened the way for
other causes producing such an effect."

While the whole coast of Sweden and Finland, from Solvitzborg, on the limits of Northern Scania,
past Gefle to Tornea, and from Tornea to Abo, experiences a gradual rise of four feet in a
century, the southern part of Sweden is, according to Neilson, undergoing a simultaneous depression.*

[footnote]  *See Berzelius, 'Jahrsbericht uber die Fortschritte der Physichen Wiss.', No. 18,
s. 686.  The islands of Saltholm, opposite to Copenhagen, and Bjornholm, however, rise but
very little -- Bjornholm scarcely one foot in a century.  See Forchhammer, in 'Philos. Magazine',
3d Series, vol. ii., p. 309.

The maximum of this elevating p 296 force appears to be in the north of Lapland, and to diminish
gradually to the south toward Calmar and Solvitzborg.  Lines marking the ancient level of the
sea in pre-historic times are indicated throughout the whole of Norway,* from Cape Lindesnaes
to the extremity of the North Cape, by banks of shells identical with those of the present
seas, and which have lately been most accurately examined by Bravais during his long winter
sojourn at Bosekop.

[footnote]  *Keilhan, in 'Nyt Mag. fur Naturvid.', 1832, bd. i., p. 105-254; bd. ii., p. 57;
Bravais, 'Surles Lignes d'ancien Niveau de la Mer', 1843, p. 15-40.  See, also, Darwin, "on
the Parallel Roads of Glen-Roy and Lochaber," in 'Philos. Trans. for' 1839, p. 60.

These banks lie nearly 650 feet above the present mean level of the sea, and reappear, according
to Keilhau and Eugene Robert, in a north-northwest direction on the coasts of Spitzbergen,
opposite the North Cape.  Leopold von Buch, who was the first to draw attention to the high
banks of shells at Tromsoe (latitude 69 degrees 40'), has, however, shown that the more ancient
elevations on the North Sea appertain to a different class of phenomena, from the regular and
gradual retrogressive elevations of the Swedish shores in the Gulf of Bothnia.  This latter
phenomenon, which is well attested by historical evidence, must not be confounded with the
changes in the level of the soil occasioned by earthquakes, as on the shores of Chili and of
Cutch, and which have recently given occasion to similar observations in other countries. 
It has been found that a perceptible sinking resulting from a disturbance of the strata of
the upper surface sometimes occurs, corresponding with an elevation elsewhere, as, for instance,
in West Greenland, according to Pingel and Graah, in Dalmatia and in Scania.

Since it is highly probable that the oscillatory movements of the soil, and the rising and
sinking of the upper surface, were more strongly marked in the early periods of our planet
than at present, we shall be less surprised to find in the interior of continents some few
portions of the earth's surface lying below the general level of existing seas.  Instances
of this kind occur in the soda lakes described by General Andreossy, the small bitter lakes
in the narrow Isthmus of Suez, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Tiberias, and especially the Dead Sea.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 319-324; t. iii., p. 549-551.  The depression
of the Dead Sea has been successively determined by the barometrical measurements of Count
Berton, by the more careful ones of Russegger, and by the trigonometrical survey of Lieutenant
Symond, of the Royal Navy, who states that the difference of level between the surface of the
Dead Sea and the highest houses of Jaffa is about 1605 feet.  Mr. Alderson, who communicated
this result to the Geographical Society of London in a letter, of the contents of which I was
informed by my friend, Captain Washington, was of opinion (Nov. 28, 1841) that the Dead Sea
lay about 1400 feet under the level of the Mediterranean.  A more recent communication of Lieutenant
Symond (Jameson's 'Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal', vol. xxxiv., 1843, p. 178) gives 1312
feet as the final result of two very accordant trigonometrical operations.

The level of the water in the two last-named seas is p 297 666 and 1312 feet below the level
of the Mediterranean.  If we could suddenly remove the alluvial soil which covers the rocky
strata in many parts of the earth's surface, we should discover how great a portion of the
rocky crust of the earth was then below the present level of the sea.  The periodic, although
irregularly alternating rise and fall of the water of the Caspian Sea, of which I have myself
observed evident traces in the northern portions of its basin, appears to prove,* as do also
the observations of Darwin on the coral seas,** that without earthquakes, properly so- called,
the surface of the earth is capable of the same gentle and progressive oscillations as those
which must have prevailed so generally in the earliest ages, when the surface of the hardening
crust of the earth was less compact than at present.

[footnote]  *'Sur la Mobilite du fond de la Mer Caspienne', in my 'Asie Centr.', t. ii., p.
283-294.  The Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburgh in 1830, at my request, charged
the learned physicist Lenz to place marks indicating the mean level of the sea, for definite
epochs, in different places near Baku, in the peninsula of Abscheron.  In the same manner,
in an appendix to the instructions given to Captain (now Sir James C.) Ross for his Antarctic
expedition, I urged the necessity of causing marks to be cut in the rocks of the southern hemisphere,
as had already been done in Sweden and on the shores of the Caspian Sea.  Had this measure
been adopted in the early voyages of Bougainville and Cook, we should now know whether the
secular relative changes in the level of the seas and land are to be considered as a general,
or merely a local natural phenomenon, and whether a law of direction can be recognized in the
points which have simultaneous elevation or depression.

[footnote]  **On the elevation and depression of the bottom of the South Sea, and the diffrent
areas of alternate movements, see Darwin's 'Journal', p. 557, 561-566.

The phenomena to which we would here direct attention remind us of the instability of the present
order of things, and of the changes to which the outlines and configuration of continents are
probably still subject at long intervals of time.  That which may scarcely be perceptible in
one generation, accumulates during periods of time, whose duration is revealed to us by the
movement of remote heavenly bodies.  The eastern coast of the Scandinavian peninsula has probably
risen p 298 about 320 feet in the space of 8000 years; and in 12,000 years, if the movement
be regular, parts of the bottom of the sea which lie nearest the shores, and are in the present
day covered by nearly fifty fathoms of water, will come to the surface and constitute dry land.
But what are such intervals of time compared to the length of the geognostic periods revealed
to us in the stratified series of formations, and in the world of extinct and varying organisms!
We have hitherto only considered the phenomena of elevation; but the analogies of observed
facts lead us with equal justice to assume the possibility of the depression of whole tracts
of land.  The mean elevation of the non-mountainous parts of France amounts to less than 480
feet.  It would not, therefore, require any long period of time, compared with the old geognostic
periods, in which such great changes were brought about in the interior of the earth, to effect
the permanent submersion of the northwestern part of Europe, and induce essential alterations
in its littoral relations.

The depression and elevation of the solid or fluid parts of the earth -- phenomena which are
so opposite in their action that the effect of elevation in one part is to produce an apparent
depression in another -- are the causes of all the changes which occur in the configuration
of continents. In a work of this general character, and in an impartial exposition of the phenomena
of nature, we must not overlook the 'possibility' of a diminution of the quantity of water,
and a constant depression of the level of seas. Thgere can scarcely be a doubt that, at the
period when the temperature of the surface of the earth was higher, when the waters were inclosed
in larger and deeper fissures, and when the atmosphere possessed a totally different character
from what it does at present, great changes must have occurred in the level of seas, depending
upon the increase and decrease of the liquid parts of the earth's surface.  But in the actual
condition of our planet, there is no direct evidence of a real continuous increase or decrease
of the sea, and we have no proof of any gradual change in its level at certain definite points
of observation, as indicated by the mean range of the barometer.  According to experiments
made by Daussy and Antonio Nobile, an increase in the height of the barometer would in itself
be attended by a depression in the level of the sea.  But as the mean pressure of the atmosphere
at the level of the sea is not the same at all latitudes, owing to meteorological causes depending
upon the direction of the wind and varying degrees of moisture, the p 299 barometer alone can
not afford a certain evidence of the general change of level in the ocean.  The remarkable
fact that some of the ports in the Mediterranean were repeatedly left dry during several hours
at the beginning of this century, appears to show that currents may by changes occurring in
their direction and force, occasion a 'local'' retreat of the sea, and a permanent drying of
a small portion of the shore, without being followed by any actual diminution of water, or
any permanent depression of the ocean. We must, however, be very cautious in applying the knowledge
which we have lately arrived at, regarding these involved phenomena, since we might otherwise
be led to ascribe to water as the elder element, what ought to be referred to the two other
elements, earth and air.

As the 'external' configuration of continents, which we have already described in their horizontal
expansion, exercises, by their variously indented littoral outlines, a favorable influence
on climate, trade, and the progress of civilization, so likewise does their internal articulation,
or the vertical elevation of the soil (chains of mountains and elevated plateaux), give rise
to equally important results.  Whatever produces a polymorphic diversity of forms on the surface
of our planetary habitation -- such as mountains, lakes, grassy savannas, or even deserts encircled
by a band of forests -- impresses some peculiar character on the social condition of the inhabitants.
Ridges of high land covered by snow impede intercourse; but a blending of low, discontinued
mountain chains* and tracts of valleys, as we see so happily presented in the west and south
of Europe, tends to the multiplication of meteorological processes and the products of vegetation,
and, from the variety manifested in different kinds of cultivation in each district, even under
the same degree of latitude, gives rise to wants that stimulate the activity of the inhabitants.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Rel. Hist.', t. iii., p. 232-234.  See also, the able remarks on the
configuration of the earth, and the position of its lines of elevation in Albrechts von Roon,
'Grundzugen der Erd Volker und Staatenkunde', Abth. i., 1837, s. 158, 270, 276.

Thus the awful revolutions, during which, by the action of the interior on the crust of the
earth, great mountain chains have been elevated by the sudden upheaval of a portion of the
oxydized exterior of our planet, have served, after the establishment of repose, and on the
revival of organic life, to furnish a richer and more beautiful variety of individual forms,
and in a great measure to remove from the earth that aspect of dreary p 300 uniformity which
exercises so impoverishing an influence on the physical and intellectual powers of mankind.

According to the grand views of Elie de Beaumont, we must ascribe a relative age to each system
of mountain chains* on the supposition that their elevation must necessarily have occurred
between the period of the deposition of the vertically elevated strata and that of the horizontally
inclined strata running at the base of the mountains.

[footnnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Ueber die Geognostischen Systeme von Deutschland', in his 'Geogn.

The ridges of the Earth's crust -- elevations of strata which are of the same geognostic age
-- appear, moreover, to follow one common direction. The line of strike of the horizontal strata
is not always parallel with the axis of the chain, but intersects it, so that, according to
my views,* the phenomenon of elevation of the strata, which is even found to be repeated in
the neighboring plains, must be more ancient than the elevation of the chain.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 277-283.  See, also my 'Essai sur le Gisement
des Roches', 1822, p. 57, and 'Relat. Hist.', t. iii., p. 244-250.

The main direction of the whole continent of Europe (from southwest to northeast) is opposite
to that of the great fissures which pass from northwest to southeast, from the mouths of the
Rhine and Elbe, through the Adriatic and Red Seas, and through the mountain system of Putschi-Koh
in Luristan, toward the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.  This almost rectangular intersection
of geodesic lines exercises an important influence on the commercial relations of Europe, Asia,
and the northwest of Africa, and on the progress of civilization on the formerly more flourishing
shores of the Mediterranean.*

[footnote]  *'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 284, 286.  The Adriatic Sea likewise follows a direction
from S.E. to N.W.

Since grand and lofty mountain chains so strongly excite our imagination by the evidence they
afford of great terrestrial revolutions, and when considered as the boundaries of climates,
as lines of separation for waters, or as the site of a different form of vegetation, it is
the more necessary to demonstrate, by a correct numerical estimation of their volume, how small
is the quantity of their elevated mass when compared with the area of the adjacent continnents.
The mass of the Pyrenees, for instance, the mean elevation of whose summits, and the real quantity
of whose base have been ascertained by accurate measurements, would if scattered over p 301
the surface of France, only raise its mean level about 115 feet.  The mass of the eastern and
western Alps would in like manner only increase the height of Europe about 21 1/2 feet above
its present level.  I have found by a laborious investigation,* which from its nature, can
only give a maximum limit, that the center of gravity of the volume of the land raised above
the present level of the sea in Europe and North America is respectively situated at an elevation
of 671 and 748 feet, while it is at 1132 and 1152 feet in Asia and South America.

[footnote]  *'De la hauteur Moyenne des Continents', in my 'Asie Centrale',
t. i., p. 82-90, 165-189.  The results which I have obtained are to be
regarded as the extreme value ('nombres-limites').  Laplace's estimate of
the mean height of continents at 3280 feet is at least three times too high.
 The immortal author of the 'Mecanique Celeste' (t. v., p. 14) was led to
this conclusion by hypothetical views as to the mean depth of the sea.  I
have shown ('Asie Centr.', t. i., p. 93) that the old Alexandrian
mathematicians, on the testimony of Plutarch ('in Aemilio Paulo', cap. 15),
believed this depth to depend on the height of the mountains.  The height of
the center of gravity of the volume of the continental masses is probably
subject to slight variations in the course of many centuries.

These numbers show the low level of norther regions.  In Asia the vast steppes of Siberia are
compensated for by the great elevations of the land (between the Himalaya, the North Thibetian
chain of Kuen-lun, and the Celestial Mountains), from 28 degrees 30' to 40 degrees north latitude.
We may, to a certain extent, trace in these numbers the portions of the Earth in which the
Plutonic forces were most intensely manifested in the interior by the upheaval of continental
masses.

There are no reasons why these Plutonic forces may not, in future ages, add new mountain systems
to those which Elie de Beaumont has shown to be of such different ages, and inclined in such
different directions.  Why should the crust of the Earth have lost its property of being elevated
in the ridges? The recently-elevated mountain systems of the Alps and the Cordilleras exhibit
in Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, in Sorata, Illimani, and Chimborazo, colossal elevations which
do not favor the assumption of a decrease in the intensity of the subterranean forces.  All
geognostic phenomena indicate the periodic alternation of activity and repose;* but the quiet
we now enjoy is only apparent.

Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xxv., s. 1-58.

The tremblings which still agitate the surface under all latitudes, and in every species of
rock, the elevation of Sweden, the appearance of new islands of eruption, are all conclusive
as to the unquiet condition of our planet.

p 302 The two envelopes of the solid surface of our planet -- the liquid and the aeriform --
exhibit, owing to the mobility of their particles, their currents, and their atmospheric relations,
many analogies combined with the contrasts which arise from the great difference in the condition
of their aggregation and elasticity.  The depths of ocean and of air are alike unknown to us.
At some few places under the tropics no bottom has been found with soundings of 276,000 (or
more than four miles), while in the air, if, according to Wollaston, we may assume that it
has a limit from which waves of sound may be reverberated, the phenomenon of twilight would
incline us to assume a height at least nine times as great.*

[footnote]  *[See Wilson's Paper, 'On Wollaston's Argument from the Limitation of the Atmosphere
as to the finite Divisibility of Matter.'  -- 'Trans. of the Royal Society of Edinb.', vol.
xvi., p. 1, 1845.] -- Tr.

The arial ocean rests partly on the solid earth, whose mountain chains and elevated plateaux
rise, as we have already seen, like green wooded shoals, and partly on the sea, whose surface
forms a moving base, on which rest the lower, denser, and more saturated strata of air.

Proceeding upward and downward from the common limit of the arial and liquid oceans, we find
that the strata of air and water are subject to determinate laws of decrease of temperature.
This decrease is much less rapid in the air than in the sea, which has a tendency under all
latitudes to maintain its temperature in the strata of water most contiguous to the atmosphere,
owing to the sinking of the heavier and more cooled particles. A large series of the most carefully
conducted observations on temperature shows us that in the ordinary and mean condition of its
surface, the ocean from the equator to the forty-eighth degree of north and south latitude
is somewhat warmer than the adjacent strata of air.*

[footnnote[  *Hamboldt, 'Relation Hist.', t. iii., chap. xxix., p. 514-530.

Owing to this decrease of temperature at increasing depths, fishes and other inhabitants of
the sea, the nature of whose digestive and respiratory organs fits them for living in deep
water, may even, under the tropics, find the low degree of temperature and the coolness of
climate characteristic of more temperate and more northern latitudes.  This circumstance, which
is analogous to the prevalence of a mild and even cold air on the elevated plains of the torrid
zone, exercises a special influence on the migration and geographical distribution of many
marine animals.  Moreover, the depths at which fishes live, modify, by the increase of pressure,
their cutaneous respiration, and the p 303 oxygenous and nitrogenous contents of the swimming
bladders.

As fresh and salt water do not attain the maximum of their density at the same degree of temperature,
and as the saltness of the sea lowers the thermometrical degree corresponding to this point,
we can understand how the water drawn from breat depths of the sea during the voyages of the
Kotzebue and Dupetit-Thouars could have been found to have only the temperature of 37 degrees
and 36.5 degrees.  This icy temperatureof sea water, which is likewise manifested at the depths
of tropical seas, first led to a study of the lower polar currents, which move from both poles
toward the equator. Without these submarine currents, the tropical seas at those depths could
only have a temperature equal to the local maximum of cold possessed by the falling particles
of water at the radiating and cooled surface of the tropical sea.  In the Mediterranean, the
cause of the absence of such a refrigeration of the lower strata is ingeniously explained by
Arago, on the assumption that the entrance of the deeper polar currents into the Straits of
Gibraltar, where the water at the surface flows in from the Atlantic Ocean from west to east,
is hindered by the submariine counter-currents which move from east to west, from the Mediterranean
into the Atlantic.

The ocean, which acts as a general equalizer and moderator of climates, exhibits a most remarkable
uniformity and constancy of temperature, especially between 10 degrees north and 10 degrees
south latitude,* over spaces of many thousands of square miles, at a distance from land where
it is not penetrated by currents of cold and heated water.

[footnote]  *See the series of observations made by me in the South Sea, from 8 degrees 5'
to 13 degrees 16' N. lat., in my 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 234.

It has therefore, been justly observed, that an exact and long-continued investigation of these
thermic relations of the tropical seas might most easily afford a solution to the great and
much-contested problem of the permanence of climates and terrestrial temperatures.*

[footnote]  *We might (by means of the temperature of the ocean under the tropics) enter into
the consideration of a question which has hitherto remained unanswered, namely, that of the
constancy of terrestrial temperatures, without taking into account the very circumscribed local
influences arising from the diminution of wood in the plains and on mountains, and the drying
up of lakes and marshes.  Each age might easily transmit to the succeeding one some few data,
which would perhaps furnish the most simple, exact, and direct means of deciding whether the
sun, which is almost the sole and exclusive source of the heat of our planet, changes its physical
constitution and splendor, like the greater number of the stars, or whether, on the contrary,
that luminary has attained to a permanent condition." -- Arago, in the 'Comptes Rendus des
Seances de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. ii., p. 321, 327.

Great changes in the luminous disk of the sun would, p 304 if they were of long duration, be
reflected with more certainty in the mean temperature of the sea than in that of the solid land.

The zones at which occur the maxima of the oceanic temperature and of the density (the saline
contents) of its waters, do not correspond with the equator.  The two maxima are separated
from one another, and the waters of the highest temperature appear to form two nearly parallel
lines north and south of the geographical equator.  Lenz, in his voyage of circumnavigation,
found in the Pacific the maxima of density in 22 degrees north and 17 degrees south latitude,
while its minimum was situated a few degrees to the south of the equator.  In the region of
calms the solar heat can exercise but little influence on evaporation, because the stratum
of air impregnated with saline aqueous vapor, which rests on the surface of the sea, remains
still and unchanged.

The surface of all connected seas must be considered as having a general perfectly equal level
with respect to their mean elevation.  Local causes (probably prevailing winds and currents)
may, however, produce permanent, although trifling changes in the level of some deeply indented
bays, as for instance, the Red Sea.  The highest level of the water at the Isthmus of Suez
is at different hours of the day from 24 to 30 feet above that of the Mediterranean.  The form
of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, through which the waters appear to find an easier ingress
than egress, seems to contribute to this remarkable phenomenon, which was known to the ancients.*

[[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 321, 327.

The admirable geodetic operations of Coraboeuf and Delcrois show that no perceptible difference
of level exists between the upper surfaces of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, along the
chain of the Pyrenees, or between the coasts of northern Holland and Marseilles.*

[footnote]  *See the numerical results in p. 328-333 of the volume just named.  From the geodesical
levelings which, at my request, my friend General Bolivar caused to be taken by Lloyd and Falmare,
in the years 1828 and 1829, it was ascertained that the level of the Pacific is at the utmost
3 1/2 feet higher than that of the Caribbean Sea; and even that at different hours of the day
each of the seas is in turn the higher, according to their respective hours of flood and ebb.
If we reflect that in a distance of 64 miles, comprising 933 stations of observation, an error
of three feet would be very apt to occur, we may say that in these new operations we have further
confirmation of the equilibrium of the waters which communicate round Cape Horn.  (Arago, in
the 'Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour' 1831, p. 319.)  I had inferred from barometrical
observations instituted in 1799 and 1804, that if there were any difference between the level
of the Pacific and the Atlantic (Carribean Sea), it could not exceed three meters (nine feet
three inches).  See my 'Relat. Hist.', t. iii., p. 555-557, and 'Annales de Chimie', t. i.,
p. 55-64.  The measurements, which appear to establish an excess of height for the waters of
the Gulf of Mexico, and for those of the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, obtained by combining
the trigonometrical operations of Delcrois and Choppin with those of the Swiss and Austrian
engineers, are open to many doubts.  Notwithstanding the form of the Adriatic, it is improbable
that the level of its waters in its northern portion should be 28 feet higher than that of
the Mediterranean at Marseilles, and 25 feet higher than the level of the Atlantic Ocean. 
See my 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 332.

p 305 Disturbances of equilibrium and consequent movements of the waters are partly irregular
and transitory, dependent upon winds, and producing waves which sometimes, at a distance from
the shore and during a storm, rise to a height of more than 35 feet; partly regular and periodic,
occasioned by the position and attraction of the sun and moon, as the ebb and flow of the tides;
and partly permanent, although less intense, occurring as oceanic currents.  The phenomena
of tides, which prevail in all seas (with the exception of the smaller ones that are completely
closed in, and where the ebbing and flowing waves are scarcely or not at all perceptible),
have been perfectly explained by the Newtonian doctrine, and thus brought "within the domain
of necessary facts."  Each of these periodically-recurring oscillations of the waters of the
sea has a duration of somewhat more than half a day.  Although in the open sea they scarcely
attain an elevation of a few feet, they often rise considerably higher where the waves are
opposed by the configuration of the shores, as for instance, at St. Malo and in Nova Scotia,
where they reach the respective elevation of 50 feet, and of 65 to 70 feet.  "It has been shown
by the analysis of the great geometrician Laplace, that, supposing the depth to be wholly inconsiderable
when compared with the radius of the earth, the stability of the equilibrium of the sea requires
that the density of its fluid should be less than that of the earth; and, as we have already
seen, the earth's density is in fact five times greater than that of water.  The elevated parts
of the land can not therefore be overflowed, nor can the remains of marine animals found on
the summits of mountains have been conveyed to those localities by any previous high tides.*

[footnote]  *Bessel, 'Ueber Fluth und Ebbe', in Schumacher's 'ahrbuch', 1838, s. 225.

Oceanic currents, which exercise so important an influence on the intercourse of nations and
on the climatic relations of adjacent coasts, depend conjointly upon various causes, differing
alike in nature and importance.  Among these we may reckon the periods at which tides occur
in their progress round the earth; the duration and intensity of prevailing winds; the modifications
of density and specific gravity which the particles of water undergo in consequence of differences
in the temperature and in the relative quantity of saline contents at different latitudes and
depths;* and, lastly, the horary variations of the atmospheric pressure, successively propagated
from east to west, and occurring with such regularity in the tropics.

[footnote]  *The relative density of the particles of water depends simultaneously on the temperature
and on the amount of the saline contents -- a circumstance that is not sufficiently borne in
mind in considering the cause of currents.  The submarine current, which brings the cold polar
water to the equatorial regions, would follow an exactly opposite course, that is to say, from
the equator toward the poles, if the difference in saline contents were alone concerned.  In
this view, the geographical distribution of temperature and of density in the water of the
ocean, under the different zones of latitude and longitude, is of great importance.  The numerous
observations of Lenz (Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xx., 1830, s. 129), and those of Captain
Beechey, collected in his 'Voyage to the Pacific', vol. ii., p. 727, deserve particular attention.
See Humboldt, 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 74, and 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 346.

These currents present a remarkable spectacle; like rivers of uniform breadth, they cross the
sea in different directions, while the adjacent strata of water, which remain undisturbed,
form, as it were, the banks of these moving streams.  This diffrence between the moving waters
and those at rest is most strikingly manifested where long lines of sea-weed, borne onward
by the current, enable us to estimate its velocity.  In the lower strata of the atmosphere,
we may sometimes, during a storm, observe similar phenomena in the limited aerial current,
which is indicated by a narrow line of trees, which are often found to be overthrown in the
midst of a dense wood.

The general movement of the sea from east to west between p 307 the tropics (termed the equatorial
or rotation currnt) is considered to be owing to the propagation of tides and to the trade
winds.  Its direction is changed by the resistance it experiences from the prominent eastern
shores of continents.  The results recently obtained by Daussy regarding the velocity of this
current, estimated from observations made on the distances traversed by bottles that had purposely
been thrown into the sea, agree within one eighteenth with the velocity of motion (10 French
nautical miles, 952 toises each, in 24 hours) which I had found from a comparison with earlier
experiments.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 67; 'Nouvelles Annales des Voyages', 1839, p. 255.

Christopher Columbus, during his third voyage, when he was seeking to enter the tropics in
the meridian of Teneriffe, wrote in his journal as follows:* "I regard it as proved that the
waters of the sea move from east to west, as do the heavens ('las aguas van con los cielos'),
that is to say, like the apparent motion of the sun, moon, and stars."

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Examen Crit. de l'Hist. de la Geogr.', t. iii., p. 100.  Columbus adds
shortly after (Navarrete, 'Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos de los Espanoles', t.
i., p. 260), that the movement is strongest in the Caribbean Sea.  In fact, Rennell terms this
region, "not a current, but a sea in motion".  ('Investigation of Currents', p. 23). 66-74.

The narrow currents, or true oceanic rivers which traverse the sea, bring warm water into higher
and cold water into lower latitudes.  To the first class belongs the celebrated Gulf Stream,*
which was known to Anghiera, and more especially to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in the sixteenth century.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Examen Critique', t. ii., p. 250; 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 66-74.

iii., lib. vi., p. 57.  See Humboldt, 'Examen Critique', t. ii., p. 254-257, and t. iii., p. 108.

Its first impulse and origin is to be sought to the south of the Cape of Good Hope; after a
long circuit it pours itself from the Caribbean Sea and the Mexican Gulf through the Straits
of the Bahamas, and, following a course from south-southwest to north-northeast, continues
to recede from the shores of the United States, until, further deflected to the eastward by
the Banks of Newfoundland, it approaches the European coasts, frequently throwing a quantity
of tropical seeds ('Mimosa scandens, Guilandina bonduc, Dolichos urens') on the shores of Ireland,
the Hebrides, and Norway.  The northeastern prolongation tends to mitigate the cold of the
ocean, and to ameliorate the climate on the most northern extremity of Scandinavia.  At the
point where the Gulf Stream p 308 is deflected from the Banks of Newfoundland toward the east,
it sends off branches to the south near the Azores.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Examen Crit.', t. iii., p. 64-109

This is the situation of the Sargasso Sea, or that great bank of weeds which so vividly occupied
the imagination of Christopher Columbus, and which Oviedo calls the sea-weed meadows ('Praderias
de yerva').  A host of small marine animals inhabits these tently-moved and evergreen masses
of 'Fucus natans', one of the most generally distributed of the social plants of the sea.

The counterpart of this current (which in the Atlantic Ocean, between Africa, America, and
Europe, belongs almost exclusively to the northern hemisphere) is to be found in the South
Pacific, where a current prevails, the effect of whose low temperature on the climate of the
adjacent shores I had an opportunity of observing in the autumn of 1802.  It brings the cold
waters of the high southern latitudes to the coast of Chili, follows the shores of this continent
and of Peru, first from south to north, and is then deflected from the Bay of Arica onward
from south-southeast to north-northwest.  At certain seasons of the year the temperature of
this cold oceanic current is, in the tropics, only 60 degrees, while the undisturbed adjacent
water exhibits a temperature of 81.5 degrees and 83.7 degrees.  On that part of the shore of
South America south of Payta, which inclines furthest westward, the current is suddenly deflected
in the same direction from the shore, turning so sharply to the west that a ship sailing northward
passes suddenly from cold into warm water.

It is not known to what depth cold and warm oceanic currents propagate their motion; but the
deflection experienced by the South African current, from the Lagullas Bank, which is fully
from 70 to 80 fathoms deep, would seem to imply the existence of a far-extending propagation.
Sand banks and shoals lying beyond the line of these currents may, as was first discovered
by the admirable Benjamin Franklin, be recognized by the coldness of the water over them. 
This depression of the temperature appears to me to depend upon the fact that, by the propagation
of the motion of the sea, deep waters rise to the margin of the banks and mix with the upper
strata.  My lamented friend, Sir Humphrey Davy, ascribed this phenomenon (the knowledge of
which is often of great practical utility in securing the safety of the navigator) to the descent
of the particles of water that had been cooled by nocturnal radiation p 309 and which remain
nearer to the surface, owing to the hinderance placed in the way of their greater descent by
the intervention of sand-banks.  By his observations Franklin may be said to have converted
the thermometer into a sounding line.  Mists are frequently found to rest over these depths,
owing to the condensation of the vapor of the atmosphere by the cooled waters.  I have seen
such mists in the south of Jamaica, and also in the Pacific, defining with sharpness and clearness
the form of the shoals below them, appearing to the eye as the aerial reflection of the bottom
of the sea.  A still more striking effect of the cooling produced by shoals is manifested in
the higher strata of air, in a somewhat analogous manner to that observed in the case of flat
coral reefs, or sand islands.  In the open sea, far from the land, and when the air is calm,
clouds are often observed to rest over the spots where shoals are situated, and their bearing
may then be taken by the compass in the same manner as that of a high mountain or isolated peak.

Although the surface of the ocean is less rich in living forms than that of continents, it
is not improbable that, on a further investigation of its depths, its interior may be found
to possess a greater richness of organic life than any other portion of our planet.  Charles
Darwin, in the agreeable narrative of his extensive voyages, justly remarks that our forests
do not conceal so many animals as the low woody regions of the ocean, where the sea-weed rooted
to the bottom of the shoals, and the severed branches of fuci, loosened by the force of the
waves and currents, and swimming free, unfold their delicate foliage, upborne by air-cells.*

[footnote]  *[See 'Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs', by Charles Darwin, London, 1842.

the Years ' 1842-1846, by J. B. Jukes, Naturalist to the expedition, 1847.] -- Tr.

The application of the microscope increases, in the most striking manner, our impression of
the rich luxuriance of animal life in the ocean, and reveals to the astonished senses a consciousness
of the universality of life. In the oceanic depths, far exceeding the height of our loftiest
mountain chains, every stratum of water is animated with polygastric sea-worms, Cyclidiae and
Ophrydinae.  The waters swarm with countless hosts of small luminiferous animalcules, Mammaria
(of the order of Acalephae), Crustacea, Peridinea, and circling Nereides, which when attracted
to the surface by peculiar meteorological conditions, convert every wave into a foaming band
of flashing light.

p 310 The abundance of those marine animalcules, and the animal matter yielded by their rapid
decomposition are so vast that the sea water itself becomes a nutrient fluid to many of the
larger animals.  However much this richness in animated forms, and this multitude of the most
various and highly-developed microscopic organisms may agreeably excite the fancy, the imagination
is even more seriously, and, I might say, more solemnly moved by the impression of boundlessness
and immeasureability, which are presented to the mind by every sea voyage.  All who possess
an ordinary degree of mental activity, and delight to create to themselves an inner world of
thought, must be penetrated with the sublime image of the infinite, when gazing around them
on the vast and boundless sea, when involuntarily the glance is attracted to the distant horizon,
where air and water blend together, and the stars continually rise and set before the eyes
of the mariner.  This contemplation of the eternal play of the elements is clouded, like every
human joy, by a touch of sadness and of longing.

A peculiar predilection for the sea, and a grateful remenbrance of the impression which it
has excited in my mind, when I have seen it in the tropics in the calm of nocturnal rest, or
in the fury of the tempest, have alone induced me to speak of the individual enjoyment afforded
by its aspect before I entered upon the consideration of the favorable influence which the
proximity of the ocean has incontrovertibly exercised on the cultivation of the intellect and
character of many nations, by the multiplication of those bands which ought to encircle the
whole of humanity, by affording additional means of arriving at a knowledge of the configuration
of the earth, and furthering the advancement of astronomy, and of all other mathematical and
physical sciences.  A portion of this influence was at first limited to the Mediterranean and
the shores of southwestern Africa, but from the sixteenth century it has widely spread, extending
to nations who live at a distance from the sea, in the interior of continents.  Since Columbus
was sent to "unchain the ocean"* (as the unknown voice whispered to him in a dream when he
lay on a sick-bed near p 311 the River Belem), man has ever boldly ventured onward toward the
discovery of unknown regions.

[footnote]  *The voice addressed him in these words, "Maravillosamente Dios hizo sonar tu nombre
en la tierra; de los atamientos de la mar Oceana, que estaban cerrados con cadenas tan fuertes,
te di las llaves" -- "God will cause thy name to be wonderfully resounded through the earth,
and give thee the keys of the gates of the ocean, which are closed with strong chains." The
dream of Columbus is related in the letter to the Catholic monarchs of July the 7th, 1503.
(Humboldt, 'Examen Critique', t. iii., p. 234.)

The second external and general covering of our planet, the aerial ocean, in the lower strata,
and on the shoals of which we live, presents six classes of natural phenomena, which manifest
the most intimate connection with one another.  They are dependent on the chemical composition
of the atmosphere, the variations in its transparency, polarization, and color, its density
or pressure, its temperature and humidity, and its electricity.  The air contains in oxygen
the first element of physical animal life, and besides this benefit, it possesses another,
which may be said to be of a nearly equally high character, namely, that of conveying sound;
a faculty by which it likewise becomes the conveying sound; a faculty by which it likewise
becomes the conveyer of speech and the means of communicating thought, and consequently of
maintaining social intercourse.  If the Earth were deprived of an atmosphere, as we suppose
our moon to be, it would present itself to our imagination as a soundless desert.

The relative quantities of the substances composing the strata of air accessible to us have,
since the beginning of the nineteenth century, become the object of investigations, in which
Gay-Lussac and myself have taken an active part; it is however, only very recently that the
admirable labors of Dumas and Boussingault have, by new and more accurate methods, brought
the chemical analysis of the atmosphere to a high degree of perfection. According to this analysis,
a volume of dry air contains 20.8 of oxygen, and 79.2 of nitrogen, besides from two to five
thousandth parts of carbonic acid gas, a still smaller quantity of carbureted hydrogen gas,*
and, according to the important experiments of Saussure and Liebig, traces of ammoniacal vapors,**
from which plants derive their nitrogenous contents.

[footnote]  *Boussingault, 'Recherches sur la Composition de l'Atmosphere', in the 'Annales
de Chimie et de Physique', t. lvii., 1834, p. 171-173; and lxxi. 1839, p. 116.  According to
Boussingault and Lewy, the proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere at Audilly, at a distance,
therefore, from the exhalations of a city, varied only between 0.00028 and 0.00031 in volume.

[footnote]  **Liebig, in his important work, entitles 'Die Organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung
auf Agricultur und Physiologie', 1840, s. 62-72.  On the influence of atmospheric electricity
in the production of nitrate of ammonia, which, coming into contact with carbonate of lime,
is changed into carbonate of ammonia, see Boussingault's 'Economie Rurale consideree dans ses
Rapports avec la Chimie et la Meteorologie', 1844, t. ii., p. 247, 267, and t. i., p. 84.

Some observations of Lewy render it probable that the quantity of oxygen varies perceptibly
p 312 but slightly, over the sea and in the interior of continents, according to local conditions
or to the seasons of the year.  We may easily conceive that changes in the oxygen held in solution
in the sea, produced by microscopic animal organisms, may be attended by alterations in the
strata of air in immediate contact with it.*

[footnote]  *Lewy, in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. xvii., Part ii., p. 235-248.

The air which Martins collected at Faulhorn at an elevation of 8767 feet, contained as much
oxygen as the air at Paris.*

[footnote]  *Dumas, in the 'Annales de Chimie, 3e Serie', t. iii., 1841, p. 257.

The admixture of carbonate of ammonia in the atmosphere may probably be considered as older
than the existence of organic beings on the surface of the earth.  The sources from which carbonic
acid* may be yielded to the atmosphere are most numerous.

[footnote]  *In this enumeration, the exhalation of carbonic acid by plants during the night,
while they inhale oxygen, is not taken into account, because the increase of carbonic acid
from this source is amply counter-balanced by the respiratory process of plants during the
day.  See Boussingault's 'Econ. Rurale', t. i., p. 53-68, and Liebig's 'Organische Chemie',
s. 16, 21.

In the first place we would mention the respiration of animals, who receive the carbon which
they inhale from vegetable food, while vegetables receive it from the atmosphere; in the next
place, carbon is supplied from the interior of the earth in the vicinity of exhausted volcanoes
and thermal springs, from the decomposition of a small quantity of carbureted hydrogen gas
in the atmosphere, and from the electric discharges of clouds, which are of such frequent occurrence
within the tropics.  Besides these substances, which we have considered as appertaining to
the atmosphere at all heights that are accessible to us, there are others accidentally mixed
with them, especially near the ground, which sometimes, in the form of miasmatic and gaseous
contagia, exercise a noxious influence on animal organization. Their chemical nature has not
yet been ascertained by direct analysis; but, from the consideration of the processes of decay
which are perpetually going on in the animal and vegetable substances with which the surface
of our planet is covered, and judging from analogies deduced from the comain of pathology,
we are led to infer the existence of such noxious local admixtures.  Ammoniacal and other nitrogenous
vapors, sulphureted hydrogen gas, and compounds analogous to the polybasic ternary and quaternary
compounds analogous to the polybasic ternary and quaternary combinations of the vegetable kingdom,
may produce miasmata,* p 313 which, under various forms, may generate ague and typhus fever
(not by any means exclusively on wet, marshy ground, or on coasts covered by putrescent mollusca,
and low bushes of  'Rhizophora mangle' and Avicennia).

[footnote]  *Gay-Lussac, in 'Annales de Chimie', t. liii., p. 120; Payen, Mem. sur la Composition
Chimique des Vegetaux, p. 36, 42; Liebig, 'Org. Chemie', s. 229-345; Boussingault, 'Econ. Rurale',
t. i., p. 142-153.

Fogs which have a peculiar smell at some seasons of the year, remind us of these accidental
admixtures in the lower strata of the atmosphere.  Winds and currents of air caused by the
heating of the ground even carry up to a considerable elevation solid substances reduced to
a fine powder.  The dust which darkens the air for an extended area, and falls on the Cape
Verd Islands, to which Darwin has drawn attention, contains, according to Ehrenberg's discovery,
a host of silicious-shelled infusoria.

As principal features of a general descriptive picture of the atmosphere, we may enumerate:

1.  'Variations of atmospheric pressure': to which belong the horary oscillations, occurring
with such regularity in the tropics, where they produce a kind of ebb and flow in the atmosphere,
which can not be ascribed to the attraction of the moon,* and which differs so considerably
according to geographical latitude, the seasons of the year, and the elevation above the level
of the sea.

[footnote]  *Bouvard, by the application of the formulae, in 1827, which Laplace had deposited
with the Board of Longitude shortly before his death, found that the portion of the horary
oscillations of the pressure of the atmosphere, which depends on the attraction of the moon,
can not raise the mercury in the barometer at Paris more than the 0.018 of a millimeter, while
eleven years' observations at the same place show the mean barometric oscillation, from 9 A.M.
to 3 P.M., to be 0.756 millim., and from 3 P.M. to 9 P.M., 0.373 millim.  See 'Memoires de
l'Acad. des Sciences', t. vii., 1827, p. 267.

2.  'Climatic distribution of heat', which depends on the relative position of the transparent
and opaque masses (the fluid and solid parts of the surface of the earth), and on the hypsometrical
configuration of continents; relations which determine the geographical position and curvature
of the isothermal lines (or curves of equal mean annual temperature) both in a horizontal and
vertical direction, or on a uniform plane, or in different superposed strata of air.

3.  'The distribution of the humidity of the atmosphere'.  The quantitative relations of the
humitidy depend on the differences in the solid and oceanic surfaces; on the distance from
the equator and the level of the sea; on the form in which the p 314 aqueous vapor is precipitated,
and on the connection existing between these deposits and the changes of temperature, and the
direction and succession of winds.

4.  'The electric condition of the atmosphere'.  the primary cause of this condition, when
the heavens are serene, is still much contested.  Under this head we must consider the relation
of ascending vapors to the electric charge and the form of the clouds, according to the different
periods of the day and year; the difference between the cold and warm zones of the earth, or
low and high lands; the frequency or rarity of thunder storms, their periodicity and formation
in summer and winter; the causal connection of electricity, with the infrequent occurrence
of hail in the night, and with the phenomena of water and sand spouts, so ably investigated
by Peltier.

The horary oscillations of the barometer, which in the tropics present two maxima (viz., at
9 or 9 1/4 P.M., and 4 A.M., occurring, therefore, in almost the hottest and coldest hours),
have long been the object of my most careful diurnal and nocturnal observations.*

[footnote]  *'Observations faites pour constater la Marche des Variations Horaires du Barometre
sous les Tropiques', in my 'Relation Historique du Voyage aux Regions Equinoxiales', t. iii.,
p. 270-313.

Their regularity is so great, that, in the daytime especially, the hour may be ascertained
from the height of the mercurial column without an error, on the average, of more than fifteen
or seventeen minutes.  In the torrid zones of the New Continent, on the coasts as well as at
elevations of nearly 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, where the mean temperature falls
to 44.6 degrees, I have found the regularity of the ebb and flow of the aerial ocean undisturbed
by storms, hurricanes, rain, and earthquakes.  The amount of the daily oscillations diminishes
from 1.32 to 0.18 French lines from the equator to 70 degrees north latitude, where Bravais
made very accurate observations at Bosekop.*

[footnote]  *Bravais, in Daemtz and Martins, 'Meteorologie', p. 263.  At
Halle (51 degrees 29' N. lat.), the oscillation still amounts to 0.28 lines.
 It would seem that a great many observations will be required in order to
obtain results that can be trusted in regard to the hours of the maximum and
minimum on mountains in the temperate zone.  See the observations of horary
variations, collected on the Faulhorn in 1832, 1841, and 1842 (Martins,
'Meteorologie', p. 254.)

The supposition that, much nearer the pole, the height of the barometer is really less at 10
A.M. than at 4 P.M., and consequently, that the maximum and minimum influences of these hours
p 315 are inverted, is not confirmed by Parry's observations at Port Bowen (73 degrees 14').

The mean height of the barometer is somewhat less under the equator and in the tropics, owing
to the effect of the rising current,* than in the temperate zones, and it appears to attain
its maximum in Western Europe between the parallels of 40 degrees and 45 degrees.

t. iii., p. 313; and on the diminuation of atmospheric pressure in the tropical portions of
the Atlantic, in Poggend., 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxxvii., s. 245-258, and s. 463-486.

If with Kmtz we connect together by 'isobarometric' lines those places
which present the same mean difference between the monthly extremes of the
barometer, we shall have curves whose geographical position and inflections
yield important conclusions regarding the influence exercised by the form of
the land and the distribution of seas on the oscillations of the atmosphere.
 Hindostan with its high mountain chains and triangular peninsulas, and the
eastern coasts of the New Continent, where the warm Gulf Stream turns to the
east at the Newfoundland Banks, exhibit greater isobarometric oscillations
than do the group of the Antilles and Western Europe.  The prevailing winds
exercise a principal influence on the diminution of the pressure of the
atmosphere, and this, as we have already mentioned, is accompanied,
according to Daussey, by an elevation of the mean level of the sea.¥

[footnote]  *Dausay, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. iii., p. 136.

As the most important fluctuations of the pressure of the atmosphere, whether occurring with
horary or annual regularity, or accidentally, and then often attended by violence and danger,*
are like all the other phenomena of the weather, mainly owing to the heating force of the sun's
rays, it has long been suggested (partly according to the idea of Lambert) that the direction
of the wind should be compared with the height of the barometer, alternations of temperature,
and the increase and decrease of humidity.

[footnote]  *Dove, 'Ueber die Sturme', in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. lii., s. 1.

Tables of atmospheric pressure during different winds, termed 'barometric windroses', afford
a deeper insight into the connection of meteorological phenomena.*

[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, 'Barometrische Windrose', in 'Abhandl. der Akad. der Wiss. zu
Berlin aus den Jahren', 1818-1819, s. 187.

Dove has, with admirable sagacity, recognized, in the "law of rotation" in both hemispheres,
which he himself established, the cause of many important processes in the aerial ocean.*

[footnote]  *See Dove, 'Meteorologishe Untersuchungen', 1837, s. 99-313; and the excellent
observations of Kmtz on the descent of the west wind of the upper current in high latitudes,
and the general phenomena of the direction of the wind, in his 'Vorlesungen uber µeterologie',
1840, s. 58-66, 196-200, 327-336, 353-364; and in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1838, s. 291-302.
A very satisfactory and vivid representation of meteorological phenomena is given by Dove,
in his small work entitled 'Witterungsverhltnisse von Berlin', 1842.  On the knowledge of
the earlier navigators of the rotation of the wind, see Churruca, 'Viage at Magellanes', 1793,
p. 15; and on a remarkable expression of Columbus, which his son Don Fernando Colon has presented
to us in his 'Vida del Almirante', cap. 55, see Humboldt, 'Examen Critique de l'Hist. de Geographie',
t. iv., p. 253.

The difference of temperature between the p 315 equatorial and polar regions engenders two
opposite currents in the upper strata of the atmosphere and on the Earth's surface.  Owing
to the difference between the rotatory velocity at the poles and at the equator, the polar
current is deflected eastward, and the equatorial current westward.  The great phenomena of
atmospheric pressure, the warming and cooling of the strata of air, the aqueous deposits, and
even, as Dove has correctly represented, the formation and appearance of clouds, alike depend
on the opposition of these two currents, on the place where the upper one descends, and on
the displacement of the one by the other.  Thus the figures of the clouds, which form an animated
part of the charms of a landscape, announce the processes at work in the upper regions of the
atmosphere, and, when the air is calm, the clouds will often present, on a bright summer sky,
the "projected image" of the radiating soil below.

Where this influence of radiation is modified by the relative position of large continental
and oceanic surfaces, as between the eastern shore of Africa and the western part of the Indian
peninsula, its effects are manifested in the Indian monsoons, which change with the periodic
variations in the sun's declination,* and which were known to the Greek navigators under the
name of 'Hippalos'.

[footnote]  *'Monsun' (Malayan 'musim', the 'hippalos' of the Greeks) is derived from the Arabic
word 'mausim', a set time or season of the year, the time of the assemblage of pilgrims at
Mecca.  The word has been applied to the seasons at which certain winds prevail, which are,
besides, named from places lying in the direction from whence they come; thus, for instance,
there is the 'mausim' of Aden, of Guzerat, Malabar, etc.  (Lassen, 'Indische Alterthumskunde',
bd. i., 1843, s. 211).

In the knowledge of the monsoons, which undoubtedly dates back thousands of years among the
inhabitants of Hindostan and China, of the eastern parts of the Arabian Gulf and of the western
shores of the Malayan p 317 Sea, and in the still more ancient and more general acquaintance
with land and sea winds, lies concealed, as it were, the germ of that meteorological sciences
which is now making such rapid progress.  The long chain of 'magnetic stations' extending from
Moscow to Pekin, across the whole of Northern Asia, will prove of immense importance in determining
the 'law of the winds', since these stations have also for their object the investigation of
general meteorological relations.  The comparison of observations made at places lying so many
hundred miles apart, will decide, for instance, whether the same east wind blows from the elevated
desert of Gobi to the interior of Russia, or whether the direction of the Aerial current first
began in the middle of the series of the stations, by the descent of the air from the higher
regions.  By means of such observations, we may learn, in the strictest sense, 'whence' the
wind cometh.  If we only take the results on which we may depend from those places in which
the observations on the direction of the winds have been continued more than twenty years,
we shall find (from the most recent and careful calculations of Wilhelm Mahlmann) that in the
middle latitudes of the temperate zone, in both continents, the prevailing aerial current has
a west-southwest direction.

Our insight into the 'distribution of heat' in the atmosphere has been rendered more clear
since the attempt has been made to connect together by lines those places where the mean annual
summer and winter temperatures have been ascertain by correct observations.  The system of
'isothermal, osotheral' and 'isochimenal' lines, which I first brought into use in 1817, may,
perhaps, if it be gradually perfected by the united efforts of investigators, serve as one
of the main foundations of 'comparative climatology'.  Terrestrial magnetism did not acquire
a right to be regarded as a science until partial results were graphically connected in a system
of lines of 'equal declination, equal inclinatiion', and 'equal intensity'.

The term 'climate', taken in its most general sense, indicated all the changes in the atmosphere
which sensibly affect our organs, as temperature, humidity, variations in the barometrical
pressure, the calm state of the air or the action of opposite winds, the amount of electric
tension, the purity of the atmosphere or its admixture with more or less noxious gaseous exhalations,
and, finally, the degree of ordinary transparency and clearness of the sky, which is not only
important with respect to the increased radiation from the Earth, the organic development of
plants, and the ripening of fruits, but p 318 also with reference to its influence on the feelings
and mental condition of men.

If the surface of the Earth consisted of one and the same homogeneous fluid mass, or of strata
of rock having the same color, density, smoothness, and power of absorbing heat from the solar
rays, and of radiating it in a similar manner through the atmosphere, the isothermal, isotheral,
and isochimenal lines would all be parallel to the equator.  In this hypothetical condition
of the Earth's surface, the power of absorbing and emitting light and heat would every where
be the same under the same latitudes.  The mathematical consideration of climate, which does
not exclude the supposition of the existence of currents of heat in the interior, or in the
external crust of the earth, nor of the propagation of heat by atmospheric currents, proceeds
from this mean, and, as it were, primitive condition.  Whatever alters the capacity for absorption
and radiation, at places lying under the same parallel of latitude, gives rise to inflections
in the isothermal lines.  The nature of these inflections, the angles at which the isothermal,
isotheral, or isochimenal lines intersect the parallels of latitude, their convexity or concavity
with respect to the pole of the same hemisphere, are dependent on causes which more or less
modify the temperature under different degrees of longitude.

The progress of 'Climatology' has been remarkably favored by the extension of European civilization
to two opposite coasts, by its transmission from our western shores to a continent which is
bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean.  When, after the ephemeral colonization from Iceland
and Greenland, the British laid the foundation of the first permanent settlements on the shores
of the United States of America, the emigrants (whose numbers were rapidly increased in consequence
either of religious persecution, fanaticism, or love of freedom, and who soon spread over the
vast extent of territory lying between the Carolinas, Virginia, and the St. Lawrence) were
astonished to find themselves exposed to an intensity of winter cold far exceeding that which
prevailed in Italy, France, and Scotland, situated in corresponding parallels of latitude.
But, however much a consideration of these climatic relations may have awakened attention,
it was not attended by any practical results until it could be based on the numerical data
of 'mean annual temperature'.  If, between 58 degrees and 30 degrees north latitude, we compair
Nain, on the coast of Labrador, with Gottenburg; Halifax with Bordeaus; New p 319 York with
Naples; St. Augustine, in Florida, with Cairo, we find that, under the same degrees of latitude,
the differences of the mean annual temperature between Eastern America and Western Europe,
proceeding from north to south, are successively 20.7 degrees, 13.9 degrees, 6.8 degrees, and
almost 0 degrees.  The gradual decrease of the differences in this series extending over 28
degrees of latitude is very striking.  Further to the south, under the tropics, the isothermal
lines are every where parallel to the equator in both hemispheres.  We see, from the above
examples, that the questions often asked in society, how many degrees America (without distinguishing
between the eastern and western shores) is colder than Europe? and how much the mean annual
temperature of Canada and the United States is lower than that of corresponding latitudes in
Europe? are, when thus 'generally expressed', devoid of meaning.  There is a separate difference
for each parallel of latitude, and without a special comparison of the winter and summer temperatures
of the opposite coasts, it will be impossible to arrive at a correct idea of climatic relations,
in their influence on agriculture and other industrial pursuits, or on the individual comfort
or discomfort of manking in general.

In enumerating the causes which produce disturbances in the form of the isothermal lines, I
would distinguish between those which 'raise' and those which 'lower' the temperature.  To
the first class belong the proximity of a western coast in the temperate zone; the divided
configuration of a continent into peninsulas, with deeply-indented bays and inland seas; the
aspect of the position of a portion of the land with reference either to a sea of ice spreading
far into the polar circle, or to a mass of continental land of considerable extent, lying in
the same meridian, either under the equator, or, at least, within a portion of the tropical
zone; the prevalence of southerly or westerly winds on the western shore of a continent in
the temperate northern zone; chains of mountains acting as protecting salls against the winds
coming from colder regions; the infrequency of swamps, which, in the spring and beginning of
summer, long remain covered with ice, and the absence of woods in a dry, sandy soil; finally
the constant serenity of the sky in the summer months, and the vicinity of an oceanic current,
bringing water which is of a higher temperature than that of the surrounding sea.

Among the causes which tend to 'lower' the mean annual temperature I include the following:
elevation above the level of the sea, when not forming part of an extended plain; the p 320
vicinity of an eastern coast in high and middle latitudes; the compact configuration of a continent
having no littoral curvatures or bays; the extension of land toward the poles into the region
of perpetual ice, without the intervention of a sea remaining open in the winter; a geographical
position, in which the equatorial and tropical regions are occupied by the sea, and consequently,
the absence, under the same meridian, of a continental tropical land having a strong capacity
for the absorption and radiation of heat; mountain chains, whose mural form and direction impede
the access of warm winds, the vicinity of isolated peaks, occasioning the descent of cold currents
of air down their declivities; extensive woods, which hinder the isolation of the soil by the
vital activity of their foliage, which produces great evaporation, owing to the extension of
these organs, and increases the surface that is cooled by radiation, acting consequently in
a three-fold manner, by shade, evaporation, and radiation; the frequency of swamps or marshes,
which in the north form a kind of subterranean glacier in the plains, lasting till the middle
of the summer; a cloudy summer sky, which weakens the action of the solar rays; and, finally,
a very clear winter sky, favoring the radiation of heat.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Recherches sur les Causes des Inflexions des Lignes Isothermes', in
'Asie Centr.', t. iii., p. 103-114, 118, 122, 188.

The simultaneous action of these disturbing causes, whether productive of an increase or decrease
of heat, determines, as the total effect, the inflection of the isothermal lines, especially
with relation to the expansion and configuration of solid continental masses, as compared with
the liquid oceanic.  These perturbations give rise to convex and concave summits of the isothermal
curves.  There are, however, different orders of disturbing causes, and each one must, therefore,
be considered separately, in order that their total effect may afterward be investigated with
reference to the motion (direction, local curvature) of the isothermal lines, and the actions
by which they are connected together, modified, destroyed, or increased in intensity, as manifested
in the contact and intersection of small oscillatory movements.  Such is the method by which,
I hope, it may some day be possible to connect together, by empirical and numerically expressed
laws, vast series of apparently isolated facts, and to exhibit the mutual dependence which
must necessarily exist among them.

The trade winds -- easterly winds blowing within the tropics -- give rise, in both temperate
zones, to the west, or west-southwest p 321 sinds which prevail in those regions, and which
are land winds to eastern coasts, and sea winds to western coasts, estending over a space which,
from the great mass and the sinking of its cooled particles, is not capable of any considerable
degree of cooling, and hence it follows that the east winds of the Continent must be cooler
than the west winds, where their temperature is not affected by the occurrence of oceanic currents
near the shore. Cook's young companion on his second voyage of circumnavigation, the intelligent
George Forster, to whom I am indebted for the lively interest which prompted me to undertake
distant travels, was the first who drew attention, in a definite manner, to the climatic differences
of temperature existing in the eastern and western coasts of both continents, and to the similarity
of temperature of the western coast of North America in the middle latitudes, with that of
Western Europe.*

[footnote]  *George Forster, 'Klein Schriften', th. iii., 1794, s. 87; Dove, in Schumacher's
'Jahrbuch fur', s. 289; Kmtz, 'Meteorologie', bd. ii., s. 41, 43, 67, and 96; Arago, in the
'Comptes Rendus', t. i., p. 268.

Even in northern latitudes exact observations show a striking difference between the 'mean
annual temperature' of the east and west coasts of America.  The mean annual temperature of
Nain, in   (lat. 57 degrees 10'), is fully 6.8 degrees 'below' the freezing point, while on
the northwest coast, at New Archangel, in Russian America (lat. 57 degrees 3'), it is 12.4
degrees 'above' this point.  At the first-named place, the mean summer temperature hardly amounts
to 43 degrees, while at the latter place it is 57 degrees.  Pekin (39 degrees 54'), on the
eastern coast of Asia, has a mean annual tempeerature of 52.8 degrees, which is 9 degrees below
that of Naples, situated somewhat further to the north.  The mean winter temperature of Pekin
is at least 5.4 degrees below the freezing point, while in Western Europe, even at Paris (48
degrees 50'), it is nearly 6 degrees above the freezing point.  Pekin has also a mean winter
cold which is 4.5 degrees lower than that of Copenhagen, lying 17 degrees further to the north.

We have already seen the slowness with which the great mass of the ocean follows the variations
of temperature in the atmosphere, and how the sea acts in equalizing temperatures, moderating
simultaneously the severity of winter and the heat of summer.  Hence arises a second more important
contrast -- that, namely, between insular and littoral climates enjoyed by all articulated
continents having deeply indented bays and peninsulas, and between the climate of the interior
of great masses of solid land.  This remarkable contrast has been fully p 322 developed by
Leopold von Buch in all its various phenomena, both with respect to its influence on vegetation
and agriculrure, on the transparency of the atmosphere, the radiation of the soil, and the
elevation of the line of perpetual snow.  In the interior of the Asiatic Continent, Tobolsk,
Barnaul on the Oby, and Irkutsk, have the same mean summer heat as Berlin, Munster, and Cherbourg
in Normandy, the thermometer sometimes remaining for weeks together at 86 degrees or 88 degrees,
while the mean winter temperature is, during the coldest month, as low as -0.4 degrees to -4
degrees.  These continental climates have therefore justly been termed 'excessive' by the great
mathematician and physicist Buffon; and the inhabitants who live in countries having such 'excessive'
climates seem almost condemned, as Dante expresses himself, "A sofferir tormenti caldi e geli."*

[fiitbite]  *Dante, 'Divina Commedia, Purgatorio', canto iii.

In no portion of the earth, neither in the Canary Islands, in Spain, nor in the south of France,
have I ever seen more luxuriant fruit, especially grapes, than in Astrachan, near the shores
of the Caspian Sea (46 degrees 21').  Although the mean annual temperature is about 48¼degrees,
the mean summer heat rises to 70¼degrees, as at Bordeaux, while not only there, but also further
to the south, as at Kislar on the mouth of the Terek (in the latitude of Avignon and Rimini),
the thermometer sinks in the winter to -13 degrees or -22 degrees.

Ireland, Guernsey, and Jersey, the peninsula of Brittany, the coasts of Normandy, and of the
south of England, present, by the mildness of their winters, and by the low temperature and
clouded sky of their summers, the most striking contrast to the continental climate of the
interior of Eastern Europe.  In the northeast of Ireland (54 degrees 56'), lying under the
same parallel of latitude as Konigsberg in Prussia, the myrtle blooms as luxuriantly as in
Portugal.  The mean temperature of the month of August, which in Hungary rises to 70 degrees,
scarcely reaches 61 degrees at Dublin, which is situated on the same isothermal line of 49
degrees; the mean winter temperature, which falls to about 28 degrees at Pesth, is 40 degrees
at Dublin (whose mean annual temperature is not more than 49 degrees); 3.6 degrees higher than
that of Milan, Pavia, Padua, and the whole of Lombardy, where the mean annual temperature is
upward of 55¼degrees.  At Stromness, in the Orkneys, scarcely half a degree further south than
Stockholm, the winter temperature is 39 degrees, and consequently higher than that of Paris,
and neary as high as that of London. p 323 Even in the Faroe Islands, at 62 degrees latitude,
the inland waters never freeze, owing to the favoring influence of the west winds and of the
sea. On the charming coasts of Devonshire, near Salcombe Bay, which has been termed, on account
of the mildness of its climate, the 'Montpellier of the North', the Agave Mexicana has been
seen to blossoom in the open air, while orange-trees trained against espaliers, and only slightly
protected by matting, are found to bear fruit.  There, as well as at Penzance and Gosport,
and at Cherbourg on the coast of Normandy, the mean winter temperature exceeds 42 degrees,
falling short by only 2.4 degrees of the mean winter temperature of Montpellier and Florence.*

de la Societe d'Arcueil', t. iii., Paris, 1817, p. 143-165; Knight, in the 'Transactions of
the Horticultural Society of London', vol. i, p. 32; Watson, 'Remarks on the Geographical Distribution

These observations will suffice to show the important influence exercised on vegetation and
agriculture, on the cultivation of fruit, and on the comfort of mankind, by differences in
the distribution of the same mean annual temperature, through the different seasons of the year.

The lines which I have termed 'Isochimenal' and 'isotheral' (lines of equal winter and equal
summer temperature) are by no means parallel with the 'isothermal' lines (lines of equal annual
temperature).  If, for instance, in countries where myrtles grow wild, and the earth does not
remain covered with snow in the winter, the temperature of the summer and autumn is barely
sufficient to bring apples to perfect ripeness, and if, again, we observe that the grape rarely
attains the ripeness necessary to convert it into wine, either in islands or in the vicinity
of the sea, even when cultivated on a western coast, the reason must not be sought only in
the low degree of summer heat, indicated, in littoral situations, by the thermometer when suspended
in the shade, but likewise in another cause that has not hitherto been sufficiently considered,
although it exercises an active influence on many other phenomena (as, for instance, in the
inflammation of a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen), namely the difference between direct and
diffused light, or that which prevails when the sky is clear and when it is overcast by mist.
I long since endeavored to attract the attention of physicists and physiologists* to this p
324 difference, and to the 'unmeasured' heat which is locally developed in the living vegetable
cell by the action of direct light.

If, in forming a thermic scale of different kinds of cultivation,* we begin with those plants
which require the hottest climate, as the vanilla, the cacao, banana, and cocoa-nut, and proceed
to the pine-apples, the sugar-cane, coffee, fruit-bearing date-trees, the cotton-tree, citrons,
olives, edible chestnuts, and fines producing potable wine, an exact geographical consideration
of the limits of cultivation, both on plains and on the declivities of mountains, will teach
us that other climatic relations besides those of mean annual temperature are involved in these
phenomena.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, op. cit., p. 156-161; Meyen, in his 'Grundriss der Pflanzengeographie',
1836  s. 379-467; Boussingault, 'Economie Rurale', t. ii., p. 675.

Taking an example, for instance, from the cultivation of the vine, we find that, in order to
procure 'potable' wine,*  it is requisite that the mean annual heat should exceed 49 degrees,
that the winter temperature upward of 64 degrees.

[footnote]  *the following table illustrates the cultivation of the vine in Europe, and also
the depreciation of its produce according to climatic relations.  See my 'Asie Centrale', t.
iii., p. 159.  The examples quoted in the text for Bordeaux and Potsdam are, in respect of
numerical relation, alike applicable to the countries of the Rhine and Maine (48 degrees 35'
to 40 degrees 7' N. lat.).  Cherbourg in Normandy, and Ireland, show in th most remarkable
manner how, with thermal relations very nearly similar to those prevailing in the interior
of the Continent (as estimated by the thermometer in the shade), the results are nevertheless
extremely different as regards the ripeness or the unripeness of the fruit of the vine, this
difference undoubtedly depending on the circumstance whether the vegetation of the plant proceeds
under a bright sunny sky, or under a sky that is habitually obscured by clouds:

The great accordance in the distribution of the annual temperature through the different seasons,
as presented by the results obtained for the valleys of the Rhine and Maine, tends to confirm
the accuracy of these meteorological observations.  The months of December, January, and February
are reckoned as winter months.  When the different qualities of the wines produced in Franconia,
and in the countries around the Baltic, are compared with the mean summer and autumn temperature
of Wurzburg and Berlin, we are almost surprised to find a difference of only about two degrees.
The difference in the spring is about four degrees.  The influence of late May frosts on the
flowering season, and after a correspondingly cold winter, is almost as important an element
as the time of the subsequent ripening of the grape.  The difference alluded to in the text
between the true temperature of the surface of the ground and the indications of a thermometer
suspended in the shade and protected from extraneous influences, is inferred by Dove from a
consideration of the results of fifteen years' observations made at the Chiswick Gardens. 
See Dove, in 'Bericht uber die Verhandl. der Berl. Akad. der Wiss.', August, 1844, s. 285.

At Bordeaux, in the valley of the Garonne (44 degrees 50' lat.), the mean annual winter, summer,
and autumn temperatures are respectively 57 degrees, 43 degrees, 71 degrees, and 58 degrees.
In the plains near the p 325 Baltic (52 degrees 30' lat.), where a wine is produced that can
scarcely be considered potable, these numbers are as follows:  47.5 degrees, 30 degrees, 63.7
degrees, and 47.5 degrees.  If it should appear strange that the great differences indicated
by the influence of climate on the production of wine should not be more clearly manifested
by our thermometers, the circumstance will appear less singular when we remember that a thermometer
standing in the shade, and protected from the effect of direct insolation and nocturnal radiation
can not, at all seasong of the year, and during all periodic changes of heat, indicate the
true superficial temperature of the ground exposed to the whole effect of the sun's rays.

The same relations which exist between the equable littoral climate of the
peninsula of Brittany, and the lower winter and
p 326
higher summer temperature of the remainder of the continent of France, are
likewise manifested in some degree, between Europe and the great continent
of Asia, of which the former may be considered to constitute the western
peninsula.  Europe owes its milder climate, in the first place, to its
position with respect to Africa, whose wide extent of tropical land is
favorable to the ascending current, while the equatorial region to the south
of Asia is almost wholly oceanic; and next to its deeply-articulated
configuration, to the vicinity of the ocean on its western shores; and,
lastly, to the existence of an open sea, which bounds its northern confines.
 Europe would therefore become colder* if Africa were to be overflowed by
the ocean; of if the mythical Atlantis were to arise and connect Europe with
North America; or if the Gulf Stream were no longer to diffuse the warming
influence of its waters into the North Sea; or if, finally, another mass of
solid land should be upheaved by volcanic action, and interposed between the
Scandinavian peninsula and Spitzbergen.

[footnote]  *See my memoir, 'Ueber die Haupt-Ursachen der Temperaturverschiedenheit auf der
Erdoberflche', in the 'Abhandl. der Akad. der Wissensch. zu Berlin von dem Jahr' 1827, s. 311.

If we observe that in Europe the mean annual temperature falls as we proceed, from west to
east, under the same parallel of latitude, from the Atlantic shores of France through Germany,
Poland, and Russia, toward the Uralian Mountains, the main cause of this phenomenon of increasing
cold must be sought in the form of the continent (which becomes less indented, and wider, and
more compact as we advance), in the increasing distance from seas, and in the diminished influence
of westerly winds.  Beyond the Uralian Mountains these winds are converted into cool land-winds,
blowing over extended tracts covered with ice and show.  The cold of western Siberia is to
be ascribed to these relations of configuration and atmospheric currents, and not -- as Hippocrates
and Trogus Pompeius, and even celebrated travelers of the eighteenth century conjectures --
to the great elevation of the soil above the level of the sea.*

[footnote]  *The general level of Siberia, from Tobolsk, Tomsk, and Barnaul, from the Altai
Mountains to the Polar Sea, is not so high as that of Mauheim and Dresden; indeed, Irkutsk,
far to the east of the Jenisei, is only 1330 feet above the level of the sea, or about one
third lower than Munich.

If we pass from the differences of temperature manifested in the plains to the inequalities
of the polyhedric form of the surface of our planet, we shall have to consider mountains either
in relation to their influence on the climate of neighboring p 327 valleys, or according to
the effects of the hyposometrical relations on their own summits, which often spread into elevated
plateaux.  The division of mountains into chains separates the earth's surface into different
basins, which are often narrow and walled in, forming caldron-like valleys, and (as in Greece
and in part of Asia Minor) constitute an individual local climate with respect to heat, moisture,
transparancy of atmosphere, and frequency of winds and storms.  These circumstances have at
all times exercised a powerful influence on the character and cultivation of natural products,
and on the manners and institutions of neighboring nations, and even on the feelings with which
they regard one another.  This character of 'geographical individuality' attains its maximum,
if we may be allowed so to speak, in countries where the differences in the configuration of
the soil are the greatest possible, either in a vertical or horizontal direction, both in relief
and in the articulation of the continent.  The greatest contrast to these varieties in the
relations of the surface of the earth are manifested in the Steppes of Northern Asia, the grassy
plains (savannahs, llanos, and pampas) of the New Continent, the heath ('Ericeta') of Europe,
and the sandy and stony deserts of Africa.

The law of the decrease of heat with the increase of elevation at different latitudes is one
of the most important subjects involved in the study of meteorological processes, of the geography
of plants, of the theory of terrestrial refraction, and of the various hypotheses that relate
to the determination of the height of the atmosphere.  In the many mountain journeys which
I have undertaken, both within and without the tropics, the investigation of this law has always
formed a special object of my researches.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Observations Astronomiques', t. i., p. 126-140; 'Relation
Historique', t. i., p. 119, 141, 227; Biot, in 'Connaissance des Temps pour l'an' 1841, p. 90-109.

Since we have acquired a more accurate knowledge of the true relations of the distribution
of heat on the surface of the earth, that is to say, of the inflections of isothermal and isotheral
lines, and their unequal distance apart in the different eastern and western systems of temperature
in Asia, Central Europe, and North America, we can no longer ask the general question, what
fraction of the mean annual or summer temperature corresponds to the difference of one degree
of geographical latitude, taken in the same meridian?  In each system of 'isothermal' lines
of equal curvature there reigns a p 328 close and necessary connection between three elements,
namely, the decrease of heat in a vertical direction from below upward, the difference of temperature
for every one degree of geographical latitude, and the uniformity in the mean temperature of
a mountain station, and the latitude of a point situated at the level of the sea.

In the system of Eastern America, the mean annual temperature from the coast of Labrador to
Boston changes 1.6¼degrees for every degree of latitude; from Boston to Charleston about 1.7
degrees; from Charleston to the tropic of Cancer, in Cuba, the variation is less rapid, being
only 1.2 degrees.  In the tropics this diminution is so much greater, that from the Havana
to Cumana the variation is less than 0.4 degrees for every degree of latitude.

The case is quite different in the isothermal system of Central Europe. Between the parallels
of 38 degrees and 71 degrees I found that the decrease of temperature was very regularly 0.9degrees
for every degree of latitude. But as, on the other hand, in Central Europe the decrease of
heat is 1.8 degrees for about every 534 feet of vertical elevation, it follows that a difference
of elevation of about 267 feet corresponds to the difference of one degree of latitude.  The
same mean annual temperature as that occurring at the Convent of St. Bernard, at an elevation
of 8173 feet, in lat. 45 degrees 50' should therefore be met with at the level of the sea in
lat. 75 degrees 50'.

In that part of the Cordilleras which falls within the tropics, the observations I made at
various heights, at an elevation of upward of 19,000 feet, gave a decrease of 1 degree for
every 341 feet; and my friend Boussingault found, thirty years afterward, as a mean result,
319 feet.  By a comparison of places in the Cordilleras, lying at an equal elevation above
the level of the sea, either on the declivities of the mountains or even on extensive elevated
plateaux, I observed that in the latter there was an increase in the annual temperature varying
from 2.7 degrees to 4.1 degrees. This difference would be still greater if it were not for
the cooling effect of nocturnal radiation.  As the different climates are arranged in successive
strata, the one above the other, from the cacao woods of the valleys to the region of perpetual
snow, and as the temperature in the tropics varies but little throughout the year, we may form
to ourselves a tolerably correct representation of the climatic relations to which the inhabitants
of the large cities in the Andes are subjected, by comparing these climates with the temperatures
of particular months in the plains of France and Italy.  While p 329 the heat which prevails
daily on the woody shores of the Orinoco exceeds by 7.2 degrees that of the month of August
at Palermo, we find, on ascending the chain of the Andes, at Popayan, at an elevation of 3826
feet, the temperature of the three summer months of Marseilles; at Quito, at an elevation of
9541 feet, that of the close of May at Paris; and on the Paramos, at a height of 11,510 feet,
where only stunted Alpine shrubs grow, though flowers still bloom in abundance, that of the
beginning of April at Paris.  The intelligent observer, Peter Martyr de Aughiera, one of the
friends of Christopher Columbus, seems to have been the first who recognized (in the expedition
undertaken by Rodrigo Enrique Colmenares, in October, 1510) that the limit of perpetual snow
continues to ascend as we approach the equator.  We read, in the fine work 'De Rebus Oceanicis',*
"the River Gaira comes from a mountain in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria, which, according
to the testimony of the companions of Colmenares, is higher than any other mountain hitherto
discovered.

[footnote]  *Anglerius, 'De Rebus Oceanicis', Dec. xi., lib. ii., p. 140 (ed. Col., 1574).
In the Sierra de Santa Marta, the highest point of which appears to exceed 19,000 feet (see
my 'Relat. Hist.', t. ii., p. 214), there is a peak that is still called Pico de Gaira.

It must undoubtedly be so if 'it retain snow perpetually' in a zone which is not more than
10 degrees from the equinoctial line."  The lower limit of perpetual snow, in a given latitude,
is the lowest line at which snow continues during summer, or, in other words, it is the maximum
of height to which the snow-line recedes in the course of the year.  But this elevation must
be distinguished from three other phenomena, namely, the annual fluctuation of the snow-line,
the occurrence of sporadic falls of snow, and the existence of glaciers, which appear to be
peculiar to the temperate and cold zones.  This last phenomenon, since Saussure's immortal
work on the Alps, has received much light, in recent times, from the labors of Venetz, Charpentier,
and the intrepid and persevering observer Agassiz.

We know only the 'lower', and not the 'upper' limit of perpetual snow; for the mountains of
the earth do not attain to those ethereal regions of the rarefied and dry strata of air, in
which we may suppose, with Bouguer, that the vesicles of aqueous vapor are converted into crystals
of ice, and thus rendered perceptible to our organs of sight.  The lower limit of snow is not,
however, a mere function of geographical latitude or of mean annual temperature; nor is it
at the equator, or p 330 even, in the region of the tropics, that this limit attains its greatest
elevation above the level of the sea.  The phenomenon of which we are treating is extremely
complicated, depending on the general relations of temperature and humidity, and on the form
of the mountains.  On submitting these relations to the test of special analysis, as we may
be permitted to do from the number of determinations that have recently been made,* we shall
find that the controlling causes are the differences in the temperature of different seasons
of the year; the direction of the prevailing winds and their relations to this land and sea;
the degree of dryness or humitidy in the upper strata of the air; the absolute thickness of
the accumulated masses of fallen snow; the relation of the s-line to the total height of the
mountain; the relative position of the latter in the chain to which it belongs, and the steepness
of its declivity; the vicinity of either summits likewise perpetually covered with show; the
expansion, position, and elevation of the plains from which the snow mountain rises as an isolated
peak or as a portion of a chain; whether this plain be part of the sea-coast, or of the interior
of a continent; whether it be covered with wood or waving grass; and whether, finally, it consist
of a dry and rocky soil, or of a wet and marshy bottom.

[footnote]  *See my table of the height of the line of perpetual snow, in both hemispheres,
from 71 degrees 15' north lat. to 53 degrees 54' south lat., in my 'Asie Centrale', t. iii.,
p. 360.

The snow-line which, under the equator in South America, attains an elevation equal to that
of the summit of Mont Blanc in the Alps, and descends, according to recent measurements, about
1023 feet lower toward the northern tropic in the elevated plateaux of Mexico (in 19 degrees
north latitude), rises, according to Pentland, in the southern tropical zone (14 degrees 30'
to 18 degrees south latitude), being more than 2665 feet higher in the maritime and western
branch of the Cordilleras of Chili than under the equator near Quito on Chimborazo, Cotopaxi,
and Antisana.  Dr. Gilles even asserts that much further to the south, on the declivity of
the volcano of Peuquenes (latitude 33 degrees), he found the snow-line at an elevation of between
14,520 and 15,030 feet.  The evaporation of the snow in the extremely dry air of the summer,
and under a cloudless sky, is so powerful, that the volcano of Aconcagua, northeast of Valparaiso
(latitude 32 degrees 30'), which was found in the expedition of the Beagle to be more than
1400 feet higher than Chimborazo, was on one occasion seen free from snow.¥

[footnote]  *Darwin, 'Journal of the Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle', p. 297.  As the
volcano of Aconcagua was not at that time in a state of eruption, we must not ascribe the remarkable
phenomenon of this absence of snow to the internal heat of the mountain (to the escape of heated
air through fissures), as is sometimes the case with Cotopaxi.  Gilles, in the 'Journal of
Natural Science', 1830, p. 316.

In p 331 an almost equal northern latitude (from 30 degrees 45' to 31 degrees), the snow'line
on the southern declivity of the Himalaya lies at an elevation of 12,982 feet, which is about
the same as the height which we might have assigned to it from a comparison with other mountain
chains; on the northern declivity, however, under the influence of the high lands of Thibet
(whose mean elevation appears to be about 11,510 feet), the snow-line is situated at a height
of 16,630 feet.  This phenomenon, which has long been contested both in Europe and in India,
and whose causes I have attempted to develop in various works, published since 1820,* possesses
other grounds of interest than p 332 those of a purely physical nature, since it exercises
no inconsiderable degree of influence on the mode of life of numerous tribes -- the meteorological
processes of the atmosphere being the controlling causes on which depend the agricultural or
pastoral pursuits of the inhabitants of extensive tracts of continents.

[footnote]  *See my 'Second Memoire sur les Montagnes de Inde', in the 'Annales de Chemie et
de Physique', t. xiv., p. 5-55; and 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 281-327.  While the most learned
and experienced travelers in India, Colebrooke, Webb, and Hodgson, Victor Jacquemont, Fobes
Royle, Carl von Hugel, and Vigne, who have all personally examined the Himalaya range, are
agreed, regarding the greater elevation of the snow-line on the Thibeta=ian side, the accuracy
of this statement is called in question by John Gerard, by the geognoist MacClelland, the editor
of the 'Calcutta Journal', and by Captain Thomas Hutton, assistant surveyor of the Agra Division.
The appearance of my work on Central Asia gave rise to a rediscussion of this question.  A
recent number (vol. iv., January, 1844) of MacClelland and Griffith's 'Calcutta Journal of
Natural History' contains, however, a very remarkable and decisive notice of the determination
of the snow-line in the Himalaya.  Mr. Batten, of the Bengal service, writes as follows from
Camp Semulka, on the Cosillah River, Kumaon:  "In the July, 1843, No. 14 of your valuable Journal
of Natural History, which I have only lately had the opportunity of seeing, I read Captain
Hutton's paper on the snow of the Himalayas, and as I differed almost entirely from the conclusions
so confidently drawn by that gentleman, I thought it right, for the interest of scientific
truth, to prepare some kind of answer; as however, on a more attentive perusal, I find that
you yourself appear implicitly to adopt Captain Hutton's views, and actually use these words,
'We have long been conscious of the error here so well ppointed out by Captain Hutton, 'in
common with every one who has visited the Himalayas,' I feel more inclined to address you,
in the first instance, and to ask whether you will publish a short reply which I meditate;
and whether your not to Captain Hutton's paper was written after your own full and careful
examination of the subject, or merely on a general kind of acquiscence with the fact and opinions
of your able contributor, who is so well known and esteemed as a collector of scientific data?
Now I am one who have visited the Himalaya on the western side; I have crossed the Borendo
or Booria Pass into the Buspa Valley, in Lower Kanawar, returning into the Rewaien Mountains
of Ghurwal by the Koopin Pass; I have visited the source of the Jumna at Jumnootree; and, moving
eastward, the sources of the Kalee or Mundaknee branch of the Ganges at Kadarnath; of the Bishnoo
Gunga, or Aluknunda, at Buddrinath and Mana; of the Pindur at the foot of the Great Peak Nundidavi;
of the Dhoulee branch of the Ganges, beyond Neetee, crossing and recrossing the pass of that
name into Thibet; of the Goree or great branch of the Sardah, or Kalee, near Oonta Dhoora,
beyond Melum.  I have also, in my official capacity made the settlement of the Bhote Mehals
of this province.  My residence of more than six years in the hills has thrown me constantly
in the way of European and native travelers, nor have I neglected to acquire information from
the recorded labors of others.  Yet, with all this experience, I am prepared to affirm that
'the perpetual snow-line is at a higher elevation' on the northern slope of 'the Himalaya'
than on the southern slope. "The facts mentioned by Captain Hutton appear to me only to refer
to the northern sides of all mountains in these regions, and not to affect, in any way the
reports of Captain Webb and others, on which Humboldt formed his theory.  Indeed how can any
facts of one observer in one place falsify the facts of another observer in another place?
I willingly allow that the north side of a hill retains the snow longer and deeper than the
south side, and this observation applies equally to heights in Bhote; but Humboldt's theory
is on the question of the perpetual snow-line, and Captain Hutton's reference to Simla and
Mussooree, and other mountain sites, are out of place in this question, or else he fights against
a shadow, or an objectioon of his own creation.  In no part of his paper does he quote accurately
the dictum which he wishes to oppose." If the mean altitude of the thibetian highlands be 11,510
feet, they admit of comparison with the lovely and fruitful plateau of Caxamarca in Peru. But
at this estimate they would still be 1300 feet lower than the plateau of Bolivia at the Lake
of Titicaca, and the causeway of the town of Potosi. Ladak, as appears from Vigne's measurement,
by determining the boiling-point, is 9994 feet high.  This is probably also the altitude of
H'Lassa (Yul-sung), a monastic city, which Chinese writers describe as the 'realm of pleasure',
and which is surrounded by vineyards.  Must not these lie in deep valleys?

As the quantity of moisture in the atmosphere increases with the temperature, this element,
which is so important for the whole organic creation, must vary with the hours of the day,
the seasons of the year, and the differences in latitude and elevation.  Our knowledge of the
hygrometric relations of the Earth's surface has been very materially augmented of late years
by the general application of August's psychrometer, framed in accordance with the views of
Dalton and Daniell, for determining the relative quantity of vapor, or the p 333 condition
of moisture of the atmosphere, by means of the difference of the 'dew point' and of the temperature
of the air.  Temperature, atmospheric pressure, and the direction of the wind, are all intimately
connected with the vivifying action of atmospheric moisture.  This influence is not, however,
so much a consequence of the quantity of moisture held in solution in different zones, as of
the nature and frequency of the precipitation which moistens the ground, whether in the form
of dew, mist, rain, or snow. According to the exposition made by Dove of the law of rotation,
and to the general views of this distinguished physicist,* it would appear that, in our northern
zone, "the elastic force of the vapor is greatest with a southwest, and least with a northeast
wind.  On the western side of the windrose this elasticity diminishes, while it increases on
the eastern side; on the former side, for instance, the cold, dense, and dry current of air
repels the warmer, lighter current containing an abundance of aqueous vapor, while on the eastern
side it is the former current which is repulsed by the latter.

[footnote]  *See Dove, 'Meteorologische Vergleichung  von Nordamerika und Europa', in Schumacher's
'Jahrbuch fur' 1841, s. 311; and his 'Meteorologische Untersuchungen', s. 140.

The agreeable and fresh verdure which is observed in many trees in districts within the tropics,
where, for five or seven months of the yeqar, not a cloud is seen on the vault of heaven, and
where no perceptible dew or rain falls, proves that the leaves are capable of extyracting water
from the atmosphere by a peculiar vital process of their own, which perhaps is not alone that
of producing cold by radiation.  The absence of rain in the arid plains of Cumana, Coro, and
Ceara in North Brazil, forms a striking contrast to the quanitity of rain which falls in some
tropical regions, as, for instance, in the Havana, where it would appear, from the average
of six years' observation by Ramong de la Sagra, the mean annual quantity of rain is 109 inches,
equal to four or five times that which falls at Paris or at Geneva.*

[footnote]  *The mean annual quantity of rain that fell in Paris between 1805 and 1822 was
found by Arago to be 20 inches; in London, between 1812 and 1827, it was determined by Howard
at 25 inches; while at Geneva the mean of thirty-two years' observation was 30.5 inches.  In
Hindostan, near the coast, the quantity of rain is from 115 to 128 inches; and in the island
of Cuba, fully 142 inches fell in the year 1821.  With regard to the distribution of the quantity
of rain in Central Europe, at different periods of the year, see the admirable researches of
Gasparin, Schuow, and Bravais, in the 'Bibliotheque Universelle', t. xxxvviii., p. 54 and 264;
'Tableau du Climat de l'Italie', p. 76; and Martins's notes to his excellent French translation
of Kmtz's 'Vorlesungen uber Meteorologie', p. 142.

On the declivity of the Cordilleras, p 334 the quantity of rain, as well as the temperature,
diminishes with the increase in the elevation.*

[footnote]  *According to Boussingault ('Economie Rurale', t. ii., p. 693), the mean quantity
of rain that fell at Marmato (latitude 5 degrees 27', altitude 4675 feet, and mean temperature
69 degrees) in the years 1833 and 1834 was 64 inches, while at Santa Fe de Bogota (latitude
4 degrees 36', altitude 8685 feet, and mean temperature 58 degrees) it only amounted to 39
1/2 inches.

My South American fellow-traveler, Caldas, found that, at Santa Fe de Bogota, at an elevation
of almost 8700 feet, it did not exceed 37 inches, being consequently little more than on some
parts of the western shore of Europe.  Boussingault occasionally observed at Quito that Saussure's
hygrometer receded to 26 degrees with a temperature of from 53.6 degrees to 55.4 degrees. 
Gay-Lussac saw the same hygrometer standing at 25.3 degrees in his great aerostatic ascent
in a stratum of air 7034 feet high, and with a temperature of 39.2 degrees.  The greatest dryness
that has yet been observed on the surface of the globe in the low lands is probably that which
Gustav Rose, Ehrenberg, and myself found in Northern Asia, between the valleys of the Irtisch
and the Oby.  In the Steppe of Platowskaja, after southwest winds had blown for a long time
from the interior of the Continent, with a temperature of 74.7 degrees, we found the dew point
at 24 degrees.  The air contained only 16/100ths of aqueous vapor.*

[footnote]  *For the particulars of this observation, see my 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 85-89
and 467; and regarding the amount of vapor in the atmosphere in the lowlands of tropical South
America, consult my 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 242-248; t. ii., p. 45, 164.

The accurate observers Kmtz, Bravais, and Martins have raised doubts during the last few years
regarding the greater dryness of the mountain air, which appeared to be proved by the hygrometric
measurements made by Saussure and myself in the higher regions of the Alps and the Cordilleras.
The strata of air at Zurich and on the Faulhorn, which can not be considered as an elevated
mountain when compared with non-European elevations, furnished the data employed in the comparisons
made by these observers.*

[footnote]  *Kmtz, 'Vorlesungen uber Meteorologie', s. 117.

In the tropical region of the Paramos (near the region where snow begins to fall, at an elevation
of between 12,000 and 14,000 feet), some species of large flowering myrtle-leaved alpine shrubs
are almost constantly bathed in moisture; but this fqact does not actually prove the existence
of any great and absolute quantity of aqueous vapor at such an elevation, merely affording
p 335 an evidence of the frequency of aqueous precipitation, in like manner as do the frequent
mists with which the lovely plateau of Bogota is covered. Mists arise and disappear several
times in the course of an hour in such elevations as these, and with a calm state of the atmosphere.
These rapid alternations characterize the Paramos and the elevated plains of the chain of the
Andes.

'The electricity of the atmosphere', whether considered in the lower or in the upper strata
of the clouds, in its silent problematical diurnal course, or in the explosion of the lightning
and thunder of the tempest, appears to stand in a manifold relation to all phenomena of the
distribution of heat, of the pressure of the atmosphere and its disturbances, of hydrometeoric
exhibitions, and probably, also, of the magnetism of the external crust of the earth.  It exercises
a powerful influence on the whole animal and vegetable world; not merely by meteorological
processes, as precipitations of aqueous vapor, and of the acids and ammoniacal compounds to
which it gives rise, but also directly as an electric force acting on the nerves, and promoting
the circulation of the organic juices.  This is not a place in which to renew the discussion
that has been started regarding the actual source of atmospheric eletricity when the sky is
clear, a phenomenon that has alternately been ascribed to the evaporation of impure fluids
impregnated with earths and salts,* to the growth of plants,** or to some other chemical decompositions
on the surface of the earth, to the unequal distribution of heat in the strata of the air,***
and, finally, according to Peltier's intelligent researches,**** to the agency of a constant
charge of negative electricity in the terrestrial globe.

[footnote]  *Regarding the conditions of electricity from evaporation at high temperatures,

Limiting itself to results yielded by electrometric observations, such, for instance, as are
furnished by the ingenious electro-magnetic apparatus first proposed by Colladon, the physical
description of the universe should merely notice the incontestable increase of intensity in
the general positive electricity of the atmosphere,* accompanying an increase of altitude and
and the absence of trees, its daily variations (which, according to Clark's experiments at
Dublin, p 336 take place at more complicated periods than those found by Saussure and myself),
and its variations in the different seasons of the year, at different distances from the equator,
and in the different relations of continental or oceanic surface.

[footnote]  *Duprez, 'Sur l'Electricite de l'Air' (Bruxelles, 1844), p. 56-61.

The electric equilibrium is less frequently disturbed where the aerial ocean rests on a liquid
base than where it impends over the land; and it is very striking to observe how, in extensive
seas, small insular groups affect the condition of the atmosphere, and occasion the formation
of storms.  In fogs, and in the commencement of falls of snow, I have seen, in a long series
of observations, the previously permanent positive electricity rapidly pass into the negative
condition, both on the plains of the colder zones, and in the Paramos of the Cordilleras, at
elevations varying from 11,000 to 15,000 feet.  The alternate transition was precisly similar
to that indicated by the electrometer shortly before and during a storm.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Relation Historique', t. iii., p. 318.  I here only refer to those
of my experiiments in which the three-foot metallic conductor of Saussure's electrometer was
neither moved upward nor downward, nor, according to Volta's proposal, armed with burning sponge.
Those of my readers who are well acquainted with the 'quaestiones vexatae' of atmospheric electricity
will understand the grounds for this limitation. Respecting the formation of storms in the
tropics, see my 'Rel. Hist.', t. ii., p. 45 and 202-209.

When the vesicles of vapor have become condensed into clouds, having definite outlines, the
electric tension of the external surface will be increased in proportion to the amount of electricity
which passes over to it from the separate vesicles of vapor.*

[footnote]  *Gay-Lussac, in the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t. viii., p. 167.  In consequence
of the discordant views of Lame, Becquerel, and Peltier, it is difficult to come to a conclusion
regarding the cause of the specific distribution of electricity in clouds, some of which have
a positive, and others a negative tension.  The negative electricity of the air, which near
high water-falls is caused by a disintegration of the drops of water -- a fact originally noticed
by Tralles, and confirmed by myself in various latitudes -- is very remarkable, and is sufficiently
intense to produce an appreciable effect on a delicate electrometer at a distance of 300 or
400 feet.

Slate-gray clouds are charged, according to Peltier's experiments at Paris, with negative,
and white, red, and orange-colored clouds with positive electricity.  Thunder clouds not only
envelop the highest summits of the chain of the Andes (I have myself seen the electric effect
of lightning on one of the rocky pinnacles which project upward of 15,000 feet above the crater
of the volcano of Toluca), but they have also been observed at a vertical height of 26,650
feet over the low p 337 lands in the temperate zone.*

[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour' 1838, p. 246.

Sometimes, however, the stratum of cloud from which the thunder proceeds sinks to a distance
of 5000, or, indeed, only 3000 feet above the plain.

According to Arago's investigations -- the most comprehensive that we possess on this difficult
branch of meteorology -- the evolution of light (lightning) is of three kinds -- zigzag, and
sharply defined at the edges; in sheets of light, illuminating a whole cloud, which seems to
open and refeal the light within it; and in the form of fire-balls.*

[footnote]  *Arago, op. cit., p. 249-266.  (See also, p. 268-279.)

The duration of the two first kinds scarcely continues the thousandth part of a second; but
the globular lightning moves much more slowly remaining visible for several seconds.  Occasionally
(as is proved by the recent observations, which have confirmed the description given by Nicholson
and Beccaria of this phenomenon), isolated clouds, standing high above the horizon, continue
uninterruptedly for some time to emit a luminous radiance from their interior and from their
margins, although there is no thunder to be heard, and no indication of a storm; in some cases
even hail-stones, drops of rain, and flakes of snow have been seen to fall in a luminous condition,
when the phenomenon was not preceded by thunder.  In the geographical distribution of storms,
the Peruvian coast, which is not visited by thunder or lightning, presents the most striking
contrast to the rest of the tropical zone, in which, at certain seasons of the year, thunder-storms
occur almost daily, about four or five hours after the sun has reached the meridian.  According
to the abundant evidence collected by Arago* from the testiimony of navigators (Scoresby, Parry,
Ross, and Franklin), there can be no doubt that, in general, electric explosions are extremely
rare in high northern regions (between 70 degrees and 75 degrees latitude).

[footnote]  *Arago, op. cit., p. 388-391.  The learned academician Von Baer, who has done so
much for the meteorology of Northern Asia, has not taken into consideration the extreme rarity
of storms in Iceland and Greenland; he has only remarked ('Bulletin de l'Academie de St. Petersbourg',
1839, Mai) that in Nova Zembla and Spitzbergen it is sometimes heard to thunder.

'The meteorological portion' of the descriptive history of nature which we are now concluding
shows that the processes of the absorption of light, the liberation of heat, and the variations
in the elastic and electric tension, and in the hygrometric condition of the vast aerial ocean,
are all so intimately connected together, that each individual meteorological process is modified
by the action of all the others.  The complicated p 338 nature of these disturbing causes (which
involuntarily remind us of those which the near and especially the smallest cosmical bodies,
the satellites, comets, and shooting stars, are subjected to in their course) increases the
difficulty of giving a full explanation of these involved meteorological phenomena, and likewise
limits, or wholly precludes, the possibility of that predetermination of atmospheric changes
which would be so important for horticulture, agriculture, and navigation, no less than for
the comfort and enjoyment of life.  Those who place the value of meteorology in this problematic
species of prediction rather than in the knowledge of the phenomena themselves, are firmly
convinced that this branch of science, on account of which so many expeditions to distant mountainous
regions have been undertaken, has not made any very considerable progress for centuries past.
The confidence which they refuse to the physicist they yield to changes of the moon, and to
certain days marked in the calendar by the superstition of a by-gone age.

"Great local deviations from the distribution of the mean temperature are of rare occurrence,
the variations being in general uniformly distributed over extensive tracts of land.  the deviation,
after attaining its maximum at a certain point, gradually decreases to its limits; when these
are passed, however, decided deviations are observed in the 'opposite direction'. Similar relations
of weather extend more frequently from south to north than from west to east.  At the close
of the year 1829 (when I had just completed my Siberian journey), the maximum of cold was at
Berlin, while North America enjoyed an unusually high temperature.  It is an entirely arbitrary
assumption to believe that a hot summer succeeds a severe winter, and that a cool summer is
preceded by a mild winter."  Opposite relations of weather in contiguous countries, or in two
corn-growing continents, give rise to a beneficient equalization in the prices of the products
of the vine, and of agricultural and horticultural cultivation.  It has been justy remarked,
that it is the barometer alone which indicates to us the changes that occur in the pressure
of the air throughout all the aerial strata from the place of observation to the extremest
confines of the atmosphere, while* the thermometer and psychrometer only acquaint us with all
the variations occurring in the local heat and moisture of the lower strata of p 339 air in
contact with the ground.

[footnote]  *Kmtz, in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1838, s. 285.  Regarding the opposite distribution
of heat in the east and the west of Europe and North America, see Dove, 'Repertorium der Physik',
bd. iii., s. 392-395.

The simultaneous thermic and hygrometric modifications of the upper regions
of the air can only be learned (when direct observations on mountain
stations or aerostatic ascents are impracticable) from hypothetical
combinations, by making the barometer serve both as a thermometer and an
hygrometer.  Important changes of weather are not owing to merely local
causes, situated at the place of observation, but are the consequence of a
disturbance in the equilibrium of the aerial currents at a great distance
from the surface of the Earth, in the higher strata of the atmosphere,
bringing cold or warm, dry or moist air, rendering the sky cloudy or serene,
and converting the accumulated masses of clouds into light feathery 'cirri'.
 As, therefore, the inaccessibility of the phenomenon is added to the
manifold nature and complication of the disturbances, it has always appeared
to me that meteorology must first seek its foundation and progress in the
torrid zone, where the variations of the atmospheric pressure, the course of
hydro-meteors, and the phenomena of electric explosion, are all of periodic
occurrence.

As we have now passed in review the whole sphere of inorganic terrestrial life, and have briefly
considered our planet with reference to its form, its internal heat, its electro-magnetic tension,
its phenomena of polar light, the volcanic reaction of its interior on its variously composed
solid crust, and, lastly, the phenomena of its two-fold envelopes -- the aerial and liquid
ocean -- we might, in accordance with the older method of treating physical geography, consider
that we had completed our descriptive history of the globe.  But the nobler aim I have proposed
to myself, of raising the contemplation of nature to a more elevated point of view, would be
defeated, and this delineation of nature would appear to lose its most attractive charm, if
it did not also include the sphere of organic life in the many stages of its typical development.
The idea of vitality is so intimatey associated with the idea of the existence of the active,
ever-blending natural forces which animate the terrestrial sphere, that the creation of plants
and animals is ascribed in the most ancient mythical representations of many nations to these
forces, while the condition of the surface of our planet, before it was animated by vital forms,
is regarded as coeval with the epoch of a chaotic conflict of the struggling elements.  But
the empirical domain of objective contemplation, and the delineation of our planet in its present
condition, do not include a consideration p 340 of the mysterious and insoluble problems of
origin and existence.

A cosmical history of the universe, resting upon facts as its basis, has, from the nature and
limitations of its sphere, necessarily no connection with the obscure domain embraced by a
'history of organisms',* if we understand the word 'history' in its broadest sense.

[footnote]  *The 'history of plants', which Endlicher and Unger have described in a most masterly
manner ('Grundzuge der Botanik', 1843, s. 449-468), I myself separated from the 'geography
of plants' half a century ago.  In the aphorisms appended to my 'Subterranean Flora', the following
passage occurs:  "Geognosia naturam animantem et inanimam vel, ut vocabulo minus apto, ex antiquitate
saltem haud petito, utar, corpora vitur capita: Geographia oryctologica quam simpliciter Geognosiam
vel Geologiam dicunt, virque acutissimus Wernerus egregie digessit; Geographia zoologica, cujus
doctrinae fundamenta Zimmermannus et Treviranus jecerunt; et Geographic plantarum quam aequales
nostri diu intactam reliquerunt.  Geographia plantarum vincula et cognationem tradit, quibus
omnia vegetabilia inter se connexa sint, terraetractur quos teneant, in aerem atmosphaericum
quae sit eorum vis ostendit, saxa atque rupes quibus potissimum algarum primordiis radicibusque
destruantur docet, et quo pacto in telluris superficie humus nascatur, commemorat.  Est itaque
quod differat inter Geognosiam et Physiographiam, 'historia naturalis' perperam nuncupatam
quum Zoognosia, Phytognosia, et Oryctognosia, quae quidem omnes in naturae investigatione versantur,
non nisi singulorum animalium, plantarum, rerum metallicarum vel (venia sit verbo) fossilium

plantisque paulatim obtectam, fluminum inundantium impetu denuo nudatam, iterumque siccatam
et gramine vestitam commemorat. Igitur Historia zoolopgica, Historia plantarum et Historia
oryctologica, quae non nisi pristinum orbis terrae statum indicant, a Geognosia probe distinguendae."
-- Humboldt, 'Flora Friburgensis Subterranea, cui accedunt Aphorismi ex Physiologia Chemica
Plantarum', 1793, p. ix.-x.  Respecting the "spontaneous motion." which is referred to in a
subsequent part of the text, see the remarkable passage in Aristotle, 'De Coelo,' ii., 2, p.
284, Bekker, where the distinction between animate and inanimate bodies is made to depend on
the internal or external position of the seat of the determining motion.  "No movement," says
the Stagirite, "proceeds from the vegetable spirit, because plants are buried in a still sleep,
from which nothing can arouse them" (Aristotle, 'De Generat. Animal.', v. i., p. 778, Bekker);
and again, "because plants have no desires which incite them to spontaneous motion."  (Arist.,
'De Somno et Vigil'., cap. i., p. 455, Bekker.)

It must, however, be remembered, that the inorganic crust of the Earth contains within it the
same elements that enter into the structure of animal and vegetable organs.  A physical cosmography
would therefore be incomplete p 341 if it were to omit a consideration of these forces, and
of the substances which enter into solid and fluid combinations in organic tissues, under conditiions
which, from our ignorance of their actual nature, we designate by the vague term of 'vital
forces', and group into various systems in accordance with more or less perfectly conceived
analogies.  The natural tendency of the human mind involuntarily prompts us to follow the physical
phenomena of the Earth, through all their varied series, until we reach the final stage of
the morphological evolution of vegetable forms, and the self-determining powers of motion in
animal organisms.  And it is by these links that 'the geography of organic beings -- of plants
and animals' -- is connected with the delineation of the inorganic phenomena of our terrestrial
globe.

Without entering on the difficult question of 'spontaneous motion', or, in other words, on
the difference between vegetable and animal life, we would remark, that if nature had endowed
us with microscopic powers of vision, and the integuments of plants had been rendered perfectly
transparent to our eyes, the vegetable world would present a very different aspect from the
apparent immobility and repose in which it is now manifested to our senses. The interior portion
of the cellular structure of their organs is incessantly animated by the most varied currents,
either rotating, ascending and descending, remifying, and ever changing their direction, as
manifested in the motion of the granular mucus of marine plants (Naiades, Characeae, Hydrocharidae),
and in the hairs of phanerogamic land plants; in the molecular motion first discovered by the
illustrious botanist Robert Brown, and which may be traced in the ultimate portions of every
molecule of matter, even when separated from the organ; in the gyratory currents of the globules
of cambium ('cyclosis') circulating in their peculiar vessels; and, finally, in the singularly
articulated self-unrolling filamentous vessels in the antheridia of the chara, and in the reproductive
organs of liverworts and algae, in the structural conditions of which Meyen, unhappily too
early lost to science, believed that he recognized an analogy with the spermatozoa of the animal
kingdom.*

[footnote]  *["In certain parts, probably, of all plants, are found peculiar spiral filaments,
having a striking resemblance to the spermatozoa of animals.  They have been long known in
the organs called the antheridia of mosses, Hepaticcae, and Characeae, and have more recently
been discovered in peculiar cells on the germinal frond of ferns, and on the very young leaves
of the buds of Phanerogamia.  They are found in peculiar cells, and when these are placed in
water they are torn by the filament, which commences an active spiral motion.  The signification
of these organs is at present quite unknown; they appear, from the researches of Ngeli, to
resemble the cell mucilage, or proto-plasma, in composition, and are developed from it. Schleiden
regards them as mere mucilaginous deposits, similar to those connected with the circulation
in cells, and he contends that the movement of these bodies in water is analogous to the molecular
motion of small particles of organic and inorganic substances, and depends on mechanical causes."
-- 'Outlines of Structural and Physiological Botany', by A. Henfrey, F.L.S., etc., 1846, p.
23.] -- Tr.

If to these p 342 manifold currents and gyratory movements we add the phenomena of endosmosis,
nutrition, and growth, we shall have some idea of those forces which are ever active amid the
apparent repose of vegetable life.

Since I attempted in a former work, 'Ansichten der Natur' (Views of Nature), to delineate the
universal diffusion of life over the whole surface of the Earth, in the distribution of organic
forms, both with respect to elevation and depth, our knowledge of this branch of science has
been most remarkably increased by Ehrenberg's brilliant discovery "on microscopic life in the
ocean, and in the ice of the polar regions" -- a discovery based, not on deductive conclusions,
but on direct observation.  The sphere of vitality, we might almost say, the horizon of life,
has been expanded before our eyes.  Even in the residuum obtained from the melted ice, swimming
about in round fragments in the latitude of 70 degrees 10', there were found upward of fifty
species of silicious-shelled Polygastria and Coscinodiscae with their green ovaries, and therefore
living and able to resist the extreme severity of the cold.  In the Gulf of Erebus, sixty-eight
silicious-shelled Polygastria and Phytolitharia, and only one calcareous-shelled Polythalamia,
were brought up by lead sunk to a depth of from 1242 to 1620 feet."

The greater number of the oceanic microscopic forms hitherto discovered have been silicious-shelled,
although the analysis of sea water does not yield silica as the main constituent, and it can
only be imagined to exist in it in a state of suspension.  It is not only at particular points
in inland seas, or in the vicinity of the land, that the ocean is densely inhabited by living
atoms, invisible to the naked eye, but samples of p 343 water taken up by Schayer on his return
from Van Diemen's Land (south of the Cape of Good Hope, in 57 degrees latitude, and under the
tropics in the Atlantic) show that the ocean in its ordinary condition, without any apparent
discoloration, contains numerous microscopic moving organisms, which bear no resemblance to
the swimming fragmentary silicious filaments of the genus Chaetoceros, similar to the Oscillatoriae
so common in our fresh waters.  Some few Polygastria, which have been found mixed with sand
and excrements of penguins in Cockburn Island, appear to be spread over the whole earth, while
others seem to be peculiar to the polar regions.*

[footnote]  *See Ehrenberg's treatise 'Ueber das kleinste Leben im Ocean',
read before the Academy of Science at Berlin on the 9th of May, 1844.
[Dr. J. Hooker found Diatomaceae in countless numbers between the parallels
of 70 degrees and 80 degrees south, where they gave a color to the sea, and
also the icebergs floating in it.  The death of these bodies in the South
Arctic Ocean is producing a submarine deposit, consisting entirely of the
silicious particles of which the skeletons of these vegetables are composed.
 This deposit exists on the shores of Victoria Land and at the base of the
volcanic mountain Erebus.  Dr. Hooker accounted for the fact that the
skeletons of Diatomaceae had been found in the  lava of volcanic mountains,
by referring to these deposits at Mount Erebus, which lie in such a position
as to render it quite possible that the skeletons of these vegetables should
pass into the lower fissures of the mountain, and then passing into the
stream of lava, be thrown out, unacted upon by the heat to which they have
been exposed.  See Dr. Hooker's Paper, read before the British Association
at Oxford, July, 1847.] -- Tr.

We thus find from the most recent observations that animal life predominates amid the eternal
night of the depths of ocean, while vegetable life, which is so dependent on the periodic action
of the solar rays, is most prevalent on continents.  The mass of vegetation on the Earth very
far exceeds that of animal organisms; for what is the volume of all the large living Cetacea
and Pachydermata when compared with the thickly-crosded colossal trunks of trees, of from eight
to twelve feet in diameter, which fill the vast forests covering the tropical region of South
America, between the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Rio de Madeira?  And although the character
of different portions of the earth depends on the combination of external phenomena, as the
outlines of mountains -- the physiognomy of plants and animals -- the azure of the sky -- the
forms of the clouds -- and the transparency of the atmosphere -- it must still be admitted
that the vegetable mantle with which the earth is decked constitutes the main feature of the
picture.  Animal forms are inferior in mass, and their powers of motion often withdraw them
from our sight.  The p 344 vegetable kingdom, on the contrary, acts upon our imagination by
its continued presence and by the magnitude of its forms; for the size of a tree indicates
its age, and here alone age is associated with the expression of a constantly renewed vigor.*

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Ansichten der Natur' (2te Ausgabe, 1826), bd. ii. s. 21.

In the animal kingdom (and this knowledge is also the result of Ehrenberg's discoveries), the
form which we term microscopic occupy the largest space, in consequence of their rapid propagation.*

[footnote]  *On multiplication by spontaneous division of the
mother-corpuscle and intercalation of new substance, see Ehrenberg 'Van den
jetzt lebenden Thierarten der Kreidebildung', in the 'Abhandl. der Berliner
Akad. der Wiss.', 1839, s. 94.  The most powerful productive faculty in
nature is that manifested in the Vorticellae.  Estimations of the greatest
possible development of masses will be found in Chrenberg's great work 'Die
Infusionsthierchen als volkommne Organismen', 1838, s. xiii., xix., and 244.
 "The Milky Way of these organisms comprises the genera Monas, Vibrio,
Bacterium, and Bodo."  The universality of life is so profusely distributed
throughout the whole of nature, that the smaller Infusoria live as parasites
on the larger, and are themselves inhabited by others, s. 194, 211, and 512.

The minutest of the Infusoria, the Monadidae, have a diameter which does not exceed 1/3000th
of a line, and yet these silicious-shelled organisms form in humid districts subterranean strata
of many fathoms in depth.

The strong and beneficial influence exercised on the feelings of mankind by the consideration
of the diffusion of life, throughout the realms of nature is common to every zone, but the
impression thus produced is most powerful in the equatorial regions, in the land of palms,
bamboos, and arborescent ferns, where the ground rises from the shore of seas rich in mollusca
and corals to the limits of perpetual snow.  The local distribution of plants embraces almost
all heights and all depths.  Organic forms not only descend into the interior of the earth,
where the industry of the miner has laid open extensive excavations and sprung deep shafts,
but I have also found snow-white stalactiitic columns encircled by the delicate web of an Usnea,
in caves where meteoric water could alone penetrate through fissures. Podurellae penetrate
into the icy crevices of the glaciers on Mount Rosa, the Grindelwald, and the Upper Aar; the
Chionaea nivalis (formerly known as Protococcus), exist in the polar snow as well as in that
of our high mountains.  The redness assumed by the snow after lying on the ground for soome
time was known to Aristotle, and was probably observed by him on the mountains of Macedonia.*

[footnote]  *Aristot., 'Hist. Animal.', v. xix., p. 552, Bekk.

p 345 While, on the loftiest summits of the Alps, only Lecideae, Parmeliae, and Umbilicariae
cast their colored but scanty covering over the rocks, exposed by the melted snow, beautiful
phanerogamic plants, as the Culcitium rufescens, Sida pinchinchensis, and Saxifraga Boussingaulti,
are still found to flourish in the tropical region of the chain of the Andes, at an elevation
of more than 15,000 feet.  Thermal springs contain small insects (Hydroporus thermalis), Gallionellae,
Oscillatoria and Confervae, while their waters bathe the root-fibers of phanerogamic plants.
As air and water are aniimated at different temperatures by the presence of vital organisms,
so likewise is the interior of the different portions of animal bodies. Animalcules have been
found in the blood of the frog and the salmon; according to Nordmann, the fluids in the eyes
of fishes are often filled with a worm that lives by suction (Diplostomum), while in the gills
of the bleak the same observer has discovered a remarkable double aniimalcule (Diplozoon paradoxum),
having a cross-shaped form with two heads and two caudal extremities.

Although the existence of meteoric Infusoria is more than doubtful, it can not be denied that,
in the same manner as the pollen of the flowers of the pine is observed every year to fall
from the atmosphere, minute infusorial animalcules may likewise be retained for a time in the
strata of the air, after  having been passively borne up by currents of aqueous vapor.*

[footnote]  *Ehrenberg, op. cit., s. xiv., p. 122 and 403.  The rapid multiplication of microscopic
organisms is, in the case of some (as, for instance, in wheat-eels, wheel-animals, and water-bears
or tardigrade animalcules), accompanied by a remarkable tenacity of life.  They have been seen
to come to life from a state of apparent death after being dried for twenty-eight days in a
vacuum with chloride of line and sulphuric acid, and after being exposed to a heat of 248 degrees.
See the beautiful experiments of Doyere, in 'Mem. sur les Tardigrades et sur leur propriete
de revenir a la vie', 1842, p. 119, 129, 131, 133.  Compare, also, Ehrenberg, s. 492-496, on
the revival of animalcules that had been dried during a space of many years.

This circumstance merits serious attention in reconsidering the old discussion respecting 'spontaneous
generation',* and the p 346 more so, as Ehrenberg, as I have already remarked,  has discovered
that the nebulous dust or sand which mariners often encounter in the vicinity of the Cape Verd
Islands, and even at a distance of 380 geographical miles from the African shore, contains
the remains of eighteen species of silicious-shelled polygastric animalcules.

[footnote]  *On the supposed "primitive transformation" of organized or unorganized matter
into plants and animals, see Ehrenberg, in Poggendorf's 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxiv., s.
1-48, and also his 'Infusionsthierchen', s. 121, 525, and Joh. Muller, 'Physiologie des Menschen'
(4te Aufl., 1844), bd. i., s. 8-17.  It appears to me worthy of notice that one of the early
fathers of the Church, St. Augustine, in treating of the question how islands may have been
covered with new animals and plants after the flood, shows himself in no way disinclined to
adope the view of the so-called "spontaneous generation" ('generatio aequivoca, spontanea aut
primaria'). "If," says he, "animals  have not been brought to remote islands by angels, or
perhaps by inhabitants of continents addicted to the chase, they must have been spontaneously
produced upon the earth; although here the question certainly arises, to what purpose, then,
were animals of all kinds assembled in the ark?"  "Si e terra exort" sunt (bestiae) secundum
originem primam, quando dixit Deus"  'Producat terra animam vivam!' multo clarius apparet,
non tam reparandorum animalium causa, quam figurandarum variarum gentium (?) propter ecclesiae
sacramentumin arca fuisse omnia genera, si in insulis quo transire non possent, multa animalia
terra produxit."  Augustinus, 'De Civitate Dei', lib. xvi., cap. 7:  'Opera, ed. Monach. Ordinis
S. Benedicti', t. vii., Venet., 1732, p. 422.  Two centuries before the tiime of the Bishop
of Hippo, we find, by extracts from Trogus Pompeius, that the 'generatio primaria' was brought
forward in connection with the earliest drying up of the ancient world, and of the high table-land
of Asia, precisely in the same manner as the terraces of Paradise, in the theory of the great
Linnaeus, and in the visionary hypotheses entertained in the eighteenth century regarding the
fabled Atlantis:  "Quod si omnes quondam terrae submersae profundo fuerunt, profecto editissilimam
quamque partem decurrentibus aquis primum detectam; humillimo autem solo eandem aquam diutissime
immoratam, et quanto prior quaeque pars terrarum siccata sit, tanto prius animalia generare
coepisse.  Porro Scythiam adeo editiorem omnibus terris esse ut cuncta flumina ibi nata in
Maeotium, tum deinde in Ponticum et Aegyptium mare decurrant." -- Justinus, lib. ii., cap.
1.  The erroneous supposition that the land of Scythia is an elevated table-land, is so ancient
that we meet with it most clearly expressed in Hippocrates, 'De Aere et Aquis', cap. 6, 96,
Coray.  "Scythia," says he, "coonsists of high and naked plains, which, without being crowned
with mountains, ascend higher and higher toward the north."

Vital organisms, whose relations in space are comprised under the head of the geography of
plants and animals, may be considered either according to the difference and relative numbers
of the types (their arrangement into genera and species), or according to the number of individuals
of each species on a given area.  In the mode of life of plants as in that of animals, an important
difference is noticed; they either exist in an isolated state, or live in a social condition.
Those species of plants which I have termed 'social'* uniformly cover vast extents of land.

[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Aphorismi ex Physiologia Chemica Plantarum', in the 'Flora Fribergensis
Subterranea', 1793, p. 178.

Among these we may reckon many of the marine Algae -- Cladoniae and mosses, which extend over
the desert steppes of Northern Asia -- grasses, and cacti growing p 347 together like the pipes
of an organ -- Avicennim and mangroves in the tropics -- and forests of Coniferae and of birches
in the plains of the Baltic and in Siberia.  This mode of geographical distribution determines,
together with the individual form of the vegetable world, the size and type of leaves and flowers,
in fact, the principal physiognomy of the district,* its characteracter being but little, if
at all, influenced by the ever-moving forms of animal life, which, by their beauty and diversity,
so powerfully affect the feelings of man, whether by exciting the sensations of admiration
or horror.

[footnote]  *On the physiognomy of plants, see Humboldt, 'Anischten der Natur', bd. ii., s. 1-125.

Agricultural nations increase artificially the predominance of social plants, and thus augment,
in many parts of the temperate and northern zones, the natural aspect of uniformity; and while
their labors tend to the extirpation of some wild plants, they likewise lead to the cultivation
of others, which follow the colonist in his most distant migration.  The luxuriant zone of
the tropics offers the strongest resistance to these changes in the natural distribution of
vegetable forms.

Observers who in short periods of time have passed over vast tracts of land, and ascended lofty
mountains, in which climates were ranged, as it were in strata one above another, must have
been early impressed by the regularity with which vegetable forms are distributed.  The results
yielded by their observations furnished the rough materials for a science, to which no name
had as yet been given.  The same zones of regions of vegetation which, in the sixteenth century,
Cardinal Bembo, when a youth,*described on the declivity of Aetna, were observed on Mount Ararat
by Tournefort.

[footnote]  *Aetna Dialogus.'  'Opuscula', Basil., 1556, p. 53, 54.  A very beautiful geography
of the plants of Mount AEtna has recently been published by Philippi.  See 'Linnaea', 1832, s. 733.

He ingeniously compared the Alpine flora with the flora of plains situated in different latitudes,
and was the first to observe the influence exercised in mountainous regions, on the distribution
of plants by the elevation of the ground above the level of the sea, and by the distance from
the poles in flat countries.  Menzel, in an inedited work on the flora of Japan, accidentally
made use of the term 'geography of plants'; and the same expression occurs in the fanciful
but graceful work of Bernardin de St. Pierre, 'Etudes de la Nature'.  A scientific treatment
of the subject began, however, only when the geography of plants was intimately associated
with the study of the distribution p 348 of heat over the surface of the earth, and when the
arrangement of vegetable forms in natural families admitted of a numerical estimate being made
of the different forms which increase of decrease as we recede from the equator toward the
poles, and of  the relations in which, in diffrent parts of the earth, each family stood with
reference to the whole mass of phanerogamic indigenous plants of the same region.  I consider
it a happy circumstance that, at the time during which I devoted my attention almost exclusively
to botanical pursuits, I was led by the aspect of the grand and strongly characterized features
of tropical scenery to direct my investigations toward these subjects.

The study of the geographical distribution of animals, regarding which Buffon first advanced
general, and, in most instances, very correct views, has been considerably aided in its advance
by the progress made in modern times in the geography of plants.  The curves of the isothermal
lines, and more especially those of the isochimenal lines, correspond with the limits which
are seldom passed by certain species of plants, and of animals which do not wander far from
their fixed habitation either with respect to elevation or latitude.*

[footnote]  *[The following valuable remarks by Professor Forbes, on the correspondence existing
between the distribution of existing faunas and floras of the British Islands, and the geological
changes that have affected their area, will be read with much interest; they have been copied,
by the author's permission, from the 'Survey Report', p. 16: "If the view I have put forward
respecting the origin of the flora of the British mountains be true -- and every geological
and botanical probability, so far as the are is concerned, favors it -- then must we endeavour
to find some more plausible cause than any yet shown for the presence of numerous species of
plants, and of some animals, on the higher parts of Alpine ranges in Europe and Asia, specifically
identical with  animals and plants indigenous in the regions very far north, and not found
in the intermediate lowlands.  Tournefort first remarked and Humboldt, the great organizer
of the science of natural history geography, demonstrated, that zones of elevation on mountains
correspond to parallels of latitude, the higher with the more northern or southern, as the
case might be.  It is well known that this correspondence is recognized in the general 'facies'
of the flora and fauna, dependent on generic identities.  But when announcing and illustrating
the law that climatal zones of animal and vegetable life are mutually repeated or represented
by elevation and latitude, naturalists have not hitherto sufficiently (if at all) distinguished
between the evidence of that law, as exhibited by 'representative species' and by 'identical'.
In reality, the former essentially depend on the law, the latter being an 'accident' not necessarily
dependent upon it, and which has hitherto not been accounted for.  In the case of the Alpine
flora of Britain, the evidence of the activity of the law, and the influence of the accident,
are inseparable, the law being maintained by a transported flora, for the transmission of which
I have shown we can not account by an appeal to unquestionable geological events.  In the case
of the Alps and Carpathians, and some other mountain ranges, we find the law maintained partly
by a representative flora, special in its region, i.e., by specific centers of their own, and
partly by an assemblage more or less limited in the several ranges of identical species, these
latter in several cases so numerous that ordinary modes of transportation now in action can
no more account for their presence than they can for the presence of a Norwegian flora on the
British mountains.  Now I am prepared to maintain that the same means which introduced a sub-Arctic
(now mmountain) flora into Britain, acting at the same epoch, originated the identity, as far
as it goes, of the Alpine floras of middle Europe and Central Asia; for, now that we know the
vast area swept by the glacial sea, including almost the whole of Central and Northern Europe,
and belted by land, since greatly uplifted, which then presented to the water's edge those
climatal lconditions for which a sub-Arctic flora -- destined to become Alpine -- was specially
organized, the difficulty of deriving such a flora from its paarent north, and of diffusing
it over the snowy hills bounding this glacial ocean, vanishes, and the presence of identical
species at such distant pooints remain no longer a mystery. Moreover, when we consider that
conditions during the epoch referred to, the undoubted evidences of Continental observers,
on the boounds of Asia by Sir Roderick Murchison, in America by Mr. Lyell, Mr. Logan, Captain
Bayfield, and others, and that the botanical (and zoological as well) region, essentially northern
and Alpine, designated by Professor Schouw that 'of saxifrages and mosses,' and first in his
classification, exists now only on the flanks of the great area which suffered such conditions;
and that, though similar conditions reappear, the relationship of Alpine and Arctic vegetation
in the southern hemisphere, with that in the northern, is entirely maintained by 'representative',
and not by identical species (the general truth of my explanation of Alpine floras, including
identical species, becomes so strong, that the view proposed acquires fair claims to be ranked
as a theory, and not considered merely a convenient or bold hypothesis."] -- Tr.

The p 349 elk, for instance, lives in the Scandinavian peninsula, almost ten degrees further
north than in the interior of Siberia, where the line of equal winter temperature is so remarkably
concave.  Plants migrate in the germ; and, in the case of many species, the seeds are furnished
with organs adapting them to be conveyed to a distace through the air.  When once they have
taken root, they become dependent on the soil and on the strata of air surrounding them.  Animals,
on the contrary, can at pleasure migrate from the equator toward the poles; and this they can
more especially doo where the isothermal lines are much inflected, and where hot summers succeed
a great degree of winter cold.  The royal tiger, which in no respect differs from the Bengal
species, penetrates every summer into p 350 the north of Asia as far as the latitudes of Berlin
and Hamburg, a fact of which Ehrenberg and myself have spoken in other works.*

The grouping or association of diffrent vegetable species, to which we are accustomed to apply
the term 'Floras', do not appear to me, from what I have observed in different portions of
the earth's surface, to manifest such a predominance of individual families as to justify us
in marking the geographical distinctions between the regions of the Umbellatae, of the Solidaginae,
of the Labiatae, or the Scitamineae.  With reference to this subject, my views differ from
those of several of my friends, who rank among the most distinguished of the botanists of Germany.
The character of the floras of the elevated plateaux of Mexico, New Granada, and Quito, of
European Russia, and of Northern Asia, consists, in my opinion, not so much in the relatively
larger number of the species presented by one or two natural families, as in the more complicated
relations of the coexistence of many families, and in the relative numerical value of their
species.  The Gramineae and the Cyperaceae undoubtedly predominate in meadow lands and stppes,
as do Coniferae, Cupuliferae, and Betulineae in our northern woods; but this predominance of
certain forms is only apparent, and owing to the aspect imparted by the social plants.  The
north of Europe, and that portion of Siberia which is situated to the north of the Altai Mountains,
have no greater right to the appellation of a region of Gramineae and Coniferae than have the
boundless llanos between the Orinoco and the mountain chain of Caraccas, or the pine forests
of Mexico.  It is the coexistence of forms which may partially replace each other, and their
relative numbers and association, which give rise either to the general impression of luxuriance
and diversity, or of poverty and uniformity in the contemplation of the vegetable world.

In this fragmentary sketch of the phenomena of organization, I have ascended from the simplest
cellI -- the first manifestation of life -- progressively to higher structures.  "The p 351
association of mucous granules constitutes a definitely-formed cytoblase, around which a vesicular
membrane forms ia closed well," this cell being either produced from another pre-existing cell,**
or being due to a cellular formation, which, as in the case of the fermentation-fungus, is
concealed in the obscurity of some unknown chemical process.***

But in a work like the present we can venture on no more than an allusion to the mysteries
that involve the question of modes of origin; the geography of animal and vegetable organisms
must limit itself to the consideration of germs already developed, of their haabitation and
transplantation, either by voluntary or involuntary migrations, their numerical relation, and
their distribution over the surface of the earth.

The general picture of nature which I have endeavored to delineate would be incomplete if I
did not venture to trace a few of the most marked features of the human race, considered with
reference to physical gradations -- to the geographical distribution of contemporaneous types
-- to the influence exercised upon man by the forces of nature, and the reciprocal, although
weaker action which he in his turn exercises on these natural forces. Dependent, although in
a lesser degree than plants and animals, on the soil, and on the meteorological processes of
the atmosphere with which he is surroounded -- escaping more readily from the control of natural
forces, by activity of mind and the advance of intellectual cultivation, no less than by his
wonderful capacity of adapting himself to all climates -- man every where becomes most essentially
associated with terrestrial life.  It is by these relations that the obscure and much-contested
problem of the possibility of one common descent enters into the sphere embraced by a general
physical cosmography.  The investigation of this problem will impart a nobler, and, if I may
so express myself, more purely human interest to the closing pages of this section of my work.

The vast domain of language, in whose varied structure we see mysteriously reflected the destinies
of nations, is most intimately associated with the affinity of races; and what even slight
differences of races may effect is strikingly manifested in the history of the Hellenic nations
in the zenith of their intellectual cultivation.  The most important questions of the civilization
of mankind are connected with the ideas of races, p 352 community of language, and adherence
to one original direction of the intellectual and moral faculties.

As long as attention was directed solely to the extremes in varieties of color and of form,
and to the vividness of the first impression of the senses, the observer was naturally disposed
to regard races rather as originally different species than as mere varieties.  The permanence
of certain types* in the midst of the most hostile influences, especially of climate, appeared
to favor such a view, notwithstanding the shortness of the interval of time from which the
historical evidence was derived.

[footnote]  *Tacitus, in his speculations on the inhabitants of Britain
('Agricola', cap. ii.), distinguishes with much judgment between that which
may be owing to the local climatic relations, and that which, in the
immigrating races, may be owing to the unchangeable influence of a
hereditary and transmitted type.  "Britanniam qui mortales initio coluerunt,
 indigenae an advecti, ut inter barbaros, parum coompertum.  Regarding the persistency
of types of conformation in the hot and cold regions of the earth, and in
the mountainous districts of the New Continent, see my 'Relation
Historique', t. i., p. 498, 503, and t. ii., p. 572, 574.

In my opinion, however, more powerful reasons can be advanced in support of the theory of the
unity of the human race, as, for instance, in the many intermediate gradations* in the color
of the skin and in the form of the skull, which have been made known to us in recent times
by the rapid progress of geographical knowledge -- the analogies presented by the varieties
in the species of many wild and domesticated animals -- and the more correct observations collected
regarding the limits of fecundity in hybrids.**

entitled 'Crania Americana', 1839, p. 62, 86; and on the skulls brought by Pentland from the

the admirable ethnographical remarks in which it abounds, entitled 'Reise in das Innere von
Nordamerika' (1839).

The greater number of the contrasts which were formerly supposed to exist, have disappeared
before the laborious researches of Tiedemann on the brain of negroes and of Europeans, and
the anatomical investigations p 353 of Vrolik and Weber on the form of the pelvis.

So long as only a small portion of the earth was known to the Western nations, partial views
necessarily predominated, and tropical heat and a black skin consequently appeared inseparable.
"The Ethiopians," said the ancient tragic poet Theodectes of Phaselis,* "are colored by the
near sun-god in his course with a sooty luster, and their hair is dried and crisped with the
heat of his rays."

[footnote]  *Onesicritus, in Strabo, xv., p. 690, 695, Casaub.  Welcker, 'Griechische Tragodien',
abth. iii., s. 1078, conjectures that the verses of Theodectes, cited by Strabo, are taken
from a list tragedy, which probably bore the title of "Memnon."

The campaigns of Alexander, which gave rise to so many new ideas regarding physical geography,
likewise first excited a discussion on the problematical influence of climate on races.  "Families
of animals and plants," writes one of the greatest anatomists of the day, Johannes Muller,
in his noble and comprehensive work, 'Physiologie des Menschen', "undergo, within certain limitations
peculiar to the different races and species, various modifications in their distribution over
the surface of the earth, propagating these variations as organic types of species.*

[footnote]  *[In illustration of this, the conclusions of Professor Edward Forbes respecting
the origin and diffusion of the British flora may be cited.  See the 'Survey Memoir' already
quoted, 'On the Connection between the Distribution of the existing Fauna and Flora of the
British Islands, etc.', p. 64.  "1.  The flora and fauna, terrestrial and marine, of the British
islands and seas, have originated, so far as that area is concerned, since the melocene epoch.
2.  The assemblages of animals and plants compositing that fauna and flora did not appear in
the area they now inhabit simultaneously, but at several distinct points in time.  3.  Both
the fauna and flora of the British islands and seas are composed partly of species which, either
permanently or for a time, appeared in that area before the glacial epoch; partly of such as
inhabited it during that epoch; and in great part of those which did not appear there until
afterward, and whose appearance on the earth was coeval with the elevation of the bed of the
glacial sea and the consequent climatal changes.  4.  The greater part of the terrestrial animals
and flowering plants now inhabiting the British islands are members of specific centers beyond
their area, and have migrated to it over continuous land before, during, or after the glacial
epoch.  5. The climatal conditions of the area under discussion, and north, east, and west
of it, were severer during the glacial epoch, when a great part of the space now occupied by
the British isles was under water, than they are now or were before; but there is good reason
to believe that, so far from those conditions having continued severe, or having gradually
diminished in severity southward of Britain, the cold region of the glacial epoch came directly
into contact with a region of more southern and thermal character than that in which the most
southern beds of glacial drift are now to be met with.  6.  This state of things did not materially
differ from that now existing, under corresponding latitudes, in the North American, Atlantic,
and Arctic seas, and on their bounding shores.  7.  The Alpine floras of Europe and Asia, so
far as they are identical with the flora of the Arctic and sub-Arctic zones of the Old World,
are fragments of a flora which was diffused from the north, either by means of transport not
now in action on the temperate coasts of Europe, or over continuous land which no longer exists.
The deep sea fauna is in like manner a fragment of the general glacial fauna.  8.  The floras
of the islands of the Atlantic region, between the Gulf-weed Bank and the Old World, are fragments
of the Great Mediterranean flora, anciently diffused over a land consistuted out of the upheaval
and never again subjerged bed of the (shallow) Meiocene Sea.  This great flora, in the epoch
anterior to, and probably, in part, during the glacial period, had a greater extension northward
than it now presents.  9. The termination of the glacial epoch in Europe was marked by a recession
of an Arctic fauna and flora northward, and of a fauna and flora of the Mediterranean type
southward; and in the interspace thus produced there appeared on land the Germanic fauna and
flora, and in the sea that fauna termed Celtic.  10.  The causes which thus preceded the appearance
of a new assemblage of organized beings were the destruction of many species of animals, and
probably also of plants, either forms of extremely local distribution, or such as were not
capable of enduring many changes of conditions -- species, in short, with very limited capacity
for horizontal or vertical diffusion.  11.  All the changes before, during, and after the glacial
epoch appear to have been gradual, and not sudden, so that no marked line of demarkation can
be drawn between the creatures inhabiting the same element and the same locality during two
proximate periods."] -- Tr.

The different races of mankind are forms of one sole species, by the union of two of whose
members descendants are propagated.  They are not different species of a genus, since in that
case their hybrid descendants would remain unfruitful.  But whether the human races have descended
from several primitive races of men, or from one alone, is a question that can not be determined
from experience."*

[footnote]  *Joh. Muller, 'Physiologie des Menschen', bd. ii., s. 768.

Geographical investigations regarding the ancient 'seat', the so-called
'cradle of the human race', are not devoid of a mythical
p 355
character.  "We do not know," says Wilhelm von Humboldt, in an unpublished
work 'On the Varieties of Languages and Nations', "either from history or
from authentic tradition, any period of time in which the human race has not
been divided into social groups.  Whether the gregarious condition was
original, or of subsequent occurrence, we have no historic evidence to show.
 The separate mythical relations found to exist independently of one another
in different parts of the earth, appear to refute the first hypothesis, and
concur in ascribing the generation of the whole human race to the union of
one pair.  The general prevalence of this myth has cause it to be regarded
as a traditionary record transmitted from the primitive man to his
descendants.  But this very circumstance seems rather to prove that it has
no historical foundation, but has simply arisen from an identity in the mode
of  intellectual conception, which has every where led man to adopt the same
conclusion regarding identical phenomena; in the same manner as many myths
have doubtlessly arisen, not from any historical connection existing between
them, but rather from an identity in human thought and imagination.  Another
evidence in favor of the purely mythical nature of this belief is afforded
by the fact that the first origin of mankind -- a phenomenon which is wholly
beyond the sphere of experience -- is explained in perfect conformity with
existing views, being considered on the principle of the colonization of
some desert island or remote mountainous valley at a period when mankind had
already existed for thousands of years.  It is in vain that we direct our
thoughts to the solution of the great problem of the first origin, since man
is too intimately associated with his own race and with the relations of
time to conceive of the existence of an individual independently of a
preceding generation and age.  A solution of those difficult  questions,
which can not be determined by inductive reasoning or by experience --
whether the belief in this presumed traditional condition be actually based
on historical evidence, or whether mankind inhabited the earth in gregarious
associations from the origin of the race -- can not, therefore, be
determined from philological data, and yet its elucidation ought not to be
sought from other sources."

The distribution of mankind is therefore only a distribution into 'varieties', which are commonly
designated by the somewhat indefinite term 'races'.  As in the vegetable kingdom, and in the
natural history of birds and fishes, a classification into many small families is based on
a surer foundation than p 356 where large sections are separated into a few but large divisions;
so it also appears to me, that in the determination of races a preference should be given to
the establishment of small families of nations.

[footnote]  *Prichard, op. cit., vol. i., p. 247.  Iranian is certainly a less objectionable
term for the European nations than Caucasian; but it may be maintained generally that geographical
denominations are very vague when used to express the points of departure of races, more especially
where the country which has given its name to the race, as, for instance, Turan (Mawerannahr),
has been inhabited at different periods* by Indo-Germanic and Finnish, and not by Mongolian tribes.

[footnote]  *The late arrival of the Turkish and Mongolian tribes on the Oxus and on the Kirghis
Steppes is opposed to the hypothesis of Niebuhr, according to which the Scythians of Herodotus
and Hippocrates were Mongolians.  It seems far more probable that the Scythians (Scoloti) should
be referred to the Indo-Germanic Massagetae (Alani).  The Mongolian, true Tartars (the latter
term was afterward falsely given to purely Turkish tribes in Russia and Siberia), were settled,
at that period, far in the eastern part of Asia.  See my 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 239, 400;
'Examen Critique de l'Histoire de la Geogr.', th. ii., p. 320.  A distinguished philologist,
Professor Buschmann, calls attention to the circumstance that the poet Firdousi, in his half-mythical
prefatory remarks in the 'Schahnameh', mentions "a fortress of the Alani" on the sea-shore,
in which Selm took refuge, this prince being the eldest son of the King Feridun, who in all
probability lived two hundred years before Cyrus.  The Kirghis of the Scythian steppe were
originally a Finnish tribe; their three hordes probably constitute in the present day the most
numerous nomadic nation, and their tribe dwelt, in the sixteenth century, in the same steppe
in which I have myself seen them.  The Byzantine Menander (p. 380-382, ed. Nieb.) expressly
states that the Chacan of the Turks (Thu-Khiu), in 569, made a present of a Kirghis slave to
Zemarchus, the embassador of ustinish II.; he terms her a [Greek word]; and we find in Abulgasi
('Historia Mongolorum et Tatarorum') that the Kirghis are called Kirkiz.  Similarity of manners,
where the nature of the country determines the principal characteristics, is a very uncertain
evidence of identity of race.  The life of the steppes produces among the Turks (Ti Tukiu),
the Baschkirs (Fins), the Kirghis, the Torgodi and Dsungari (Mongolians), the same habits of
nomadic life, and the same use of felt tents, carried on wagons and pitched among herds of cattle.

p 357 Languages, as intellectual creations of man, and as closely interwoven with the development
of mind, are, independently of the 'national' form which they exhibit, of the greatest importance
in the recognition of similarities or differences in races.  This importance is especially
owing to the clew which a community of descent affords in treading that mysterious labyrinth
in which the connection of physical powers and intellectual forces manifests itself in a thousand
different forms.  The brilliant progress made within the last half century, in Germany, in
philosophical philology, has greatly facilitated our investigations into the 'national' character*
of languages and the influence exercised by descent.

But here, as in all domains of ideal speculation, the dangers of deception are closely linked
to the rich and certain profit to be derived.

Positive ethnographical studies, based on a thorough knowledge of history, teach us that much
caution should be applied in entering into these comparisons of nations, and of the languages
employed by them at certain epochs.  Subjection, long association, the influence of a foreign
religion, the blending of races, even when only including a small number of the more influential
and cultivated of the immigrating tribes, have produced, in both continents, similarly recurring
phenomena; as, for instance, in introducing totally different families of languages among one
and the same race, and idioms, having one common root, among nations of the most different
origin. Great Asiatic conquerors have exercised the most powerful influence on phenomena of
this kind.

But language is a part and parcel of the history of the development of mind; and however happily
the human intellect, under the most dissimilar physical conditions, may unfettered pursue a
self-chosen track, and strive to free itself from the dominion of terrestrial influences, this
emancipation is never perfect.  There ever remains, in the natural capacities of the mind,
a trace of something that has been derived from the influences of race or of climate, whether
they be associated with a land gladdened by cloudless azure skies, or with the vapory atmosphere
of an insular region.  As, therefore, richness and grace of language are unfolded from the
most luxuriant p 358 depths of thought, we have been unwilling wholly to disregard the bond
which so closely links together the physical world with the sphere of intellect and of the
feelings by depriving this general picture of nature of those brighter lights and tints which
may be borrowed from considerations, however slightly indicated, of the relations existing
between races and languages.

While we maintain the unity of the human species, we at the same time repel the depressing
assumption of superior and inferior races of men.*

[footnote]  *The very cheerless, and, in recent times, too often discussed doctrine of the
unequal rights of men to freedom, and of slavery as an institution in conformity with nature,
is unhappily found most systematically developed in Aristotle's 'Politica', i., 3, 5, 6.

There are nations more susceptible of cultivation, more highly civilized, more enobled by mental
cultivation than others, but none in themselves nobler than others.  All are in like degree
designed for freedom; a freedom which, in the ruder conditions of society, belongs only to
the individual, but which, in social states enjoying political institutions, appertains as
a right to the whole body of the community.  "If we would indicate an idea which, throughout
the whole course of history, has ever more and more widely extended its empire, or which, more
than any other, testifies to the much-contested and still more decidedly misunderstood perfectibility
of the whole human race, it is that of establishing our common humanity -- of striving to remove
the barriers which prejudice and limited views of every kind have erected among men, and to
treat all mankind, without reference to religion, nation, or color, as one fraternity, one
great community, fitted for the attainment of one object, the unrestrained development of the
physical powers.  This is the ultimate and highest aim of society, identical with the direction
implanted by nature in the mind of man toward the indefinite extension of his existence.  He
regards the earth in all its limits, and the heavens as far as his eye can scan their bright
and starry depths, as inwardly his own, given to him as the objects of his contemplation, and
as a field for the development of his energies.  Even the child longs to pass the hills or
the seas which inclose his narrow home; yet, when his eager steps have borne him beyond those
limits, he pines, like the plant, for his native soil; and it is by this touching and beautiful
attribute of man -- this longing for that which is unknown, and this fond remembrance of that
which is lost -- that he is spared from an exclusive attachment to the present. p 359 Thus
deeply rooted in the innermost nature of man, and even enjoined upon him by his highest tendencies,
the recognition of the bond of humanity becomes one of the noblest leading principles in the
history of mankind."*

[footnote]  *Wilhelm von Humboldt, 'Ueber die Kawi-Sprache', bd. iii., s.
426.  I subjoin the following extract from this work:  "The impetuous
conquests of Alexander, the more politic and premeditated extension of
territory made by the Romans, the wild and cruel incursions of the Mexicans,
and the despotic acquisitions of the incas, have in both hemispheres
contributed to put an end to the separate existence of many tribes as
independent nations, and tended at the same time to establish more extended
international amalgamation.  Men of great and strong minds, as well as whole
nations, acted under the influence of one idea, the purity of which was,
however, utterly unknown to them.  It was Christianity which first
promulgated the truth of its exalted charity, although the seed sown yielded
but a slow and scanty harvest.  Before the religion of Christ manifested its
form, its existence was only revealed by a faint foreshadowing presentiment.
 In recent times, the idea of civilization has acquired additional
intensity, and has given rise to a desire of extending more widely the
relations of national intercourse and of intellectual cultivation; even
selfishness begins to learn that by such a course its interests will be
better served than by violent and forced isolation.  Language more than any
other attribute of mankind, binds together the whole human race.  By its
idiomatic properties it certainly seems to separate nations, but the
reciprocal understanding of foreign languages connects men together on the
other hand without injuring individual national characteristics."

With these words, which draw their charm from the depths of feeling, let a brother be permitted
to close this general description of the natural phenomena of the universe.  From the remotest
nebulae and from the revolving double stars, we have descended to the minutest organisms of
animal creation, whether manifested in the depths of ocean or on the surface of our globe,
and to the delicate vegetable germs which clothe the naked declivity of the ice-crowned mountain
summit; and here we have been able to arrange these phenomena according to partially known
laws; but other laws of a more mysterious nature rule the higher spheres of the organic world,
in which is comprised the human species in all its varied conformation, its creative intellectual
power, and the languages to which it has given existence.  A physical delineation of nature
terminates at the point where the sphere of intellect begins, and a new world of mind is opened
to our view.  It marks the limit, but does not pass it.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

TO THE PRESENT EDITION.  MARCH, 1849.

GIGANTIC BIRDS OF NEW ZEALAND. -- Vol. i., p. 287.
An extensive and highly interesting collection of bones, referrible to
several species of the 'Moa' (Dinornis of Owen), and to three or four other
genera of birds, formed by Mr. Walter Mantell, of Wellington, New Zealand,
has recently arrived in England, and is now deposited in the British Museum.
 This series consists of between 700 and 800 speciments, belonging to
different parts of the skeletons of many individuals of various sizes and
ages.  Some of the largest vertebrae, tibiae, and femora equal in magnitude
the most gigantic previously known, while others are not larger than the
corresponding bones of the living apteryx.  Among these relics are the
'skulls' and 'mandibles'  of two genera, the 'Dinornis' and 'Palapteryx';
and of an extinct genus, 'Notornis', allied to the 'Rallidae'; and the
mandibles of a species of 'Nestor', a genus of nocturnal owl-like parrots,
of which only two living species are known.*

[footnote]  *See Professor Owen's Memoir on these fossil remains, in 'Zoological Transactions',
1848.

These osseous remains are in a very different state of preservation from any previously received
from New Zealand; they are light and porous, and of a light fawn-color; the most delicate processes
are entire, and the articulating surfaces smooth and uninjured; 'fragments of egg-shells',
and even the bony rings of the trachea and air tubes, are preserved'.

The bones were dug up by Mr. Walter Mantell from a bed of marly sand, containing magnetic iron,
crystals of hornblende and augite, and the detritus of augitic rocks and earthy volcanic tuff.
The sand had filled up all the cavities and cancelli, but was in no instance consolidated or
aggregated together; it was, therefore, easily removed by a soft brush, and the bones perfectly
cleared without injury.

The spot whence these precious relics of the colossal birds that once inhabited the islands
of New Zealand were obtained, is a flat tract of land, near the embouchure of a river, named
Waingongoro, not far from Wanganui, which has its rise in the volcanic regions of Mount Egmont.
The natives affirm that this level tract was one of the places first dwelt upon by their remote
ancestors; and this tradition is corroborated by the existence of numerous heaps and pits of
ashes and charred bones indicating ancient fires, long burning on the same spot.  In these
fire-heaps Mr. Mantell found burned bones of 'men, moas', and 'dogs'.

The fragments of egg-shells, imbedded in the ossiferous deposits, had escaped the notice of
all previous naturalists.  They are, unfortunately, very small portions, the largest being
only four inches long, but they afford a chord by which to estimate the size of the original.
Mr. Mantell observes that the egg of the Moa must have been so large that a hat would form
a good egg-cup for it.  These relics evidently belong to two or more species, perhaps genera.
In some examples the external p 362 surface is smooth; in others it is marked with short intercepted
linear grooves, resembling the eggs of some of the Struthiouidae, but distinct from all known
recent types.  In this valuable collection only one bone of a mammal has been detected, namely,
'the femur of a dog'.

An interesting memoir on the probable geological position and age of the ornithic bone deposits
of New Zealand, by Dr. Mantell, based on the observations of his enterprising son, it published
in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London (1848).  It appears that in many
instances the bones are imbedded in sand and clay, which lie beneath a thick deposit of volcanic
detritus, and rest on an argillaceous stratum abounding in marine shells.  The specimens found
in the rivers and streams have been washed out of their banks by the currents which now flow
through channels from ten to thirty feet deep, formed in the more ancient alluvial soil.  Dr.
Mantell concludes that the islands of New Zealand were densely peopled at a period geologically
recent, though historically remote, by tribes of gigantic brevi-pennate birds allied to the
ostrich tribe, all, or almost all, of species and genera now extinct; and that, subsequently
to the formation of the most ancient ornithic deposit, the sea-coast has been elevated from
fifty to one hundred feet above its original level; hence the terraces of shingle and loam
which now skirt the maritime districts.  The existing rivers and mountain torrents flow in
deep gulleys which they have eroded in the course of centuries in these pleistocene strata,
in like manner as the river courses of Auvergne, in Central France, are excavated in the mammiferous
tertiary deposits of that country.  The last of the gigantic birds were probably exterminated,
like the dodo, by human agency:  some small species allied to the apteryx may possibly be met
with in the unexplored parts of the middle island.

THE DODO. -- A most valuable and highly interesting history of the dodo and its kindred* has
recently appeared in which the history, affinities, and osteology of the 'Dodo, Solitaire',
and other extinct birds of the islands Mauritius, Rodriguez, and Bourbon are admirably elucidated
by H. G. Strickland (of Oxford), and Dr. G. A. Melville.

[footnote]  *'The Dodo and its Kindred'.  By Messrs. Strickland and Melville.  1 vol. 4to.
with numerous plates.  Reeves, London, 1848.

The historical part is by the former, the osteological and physiological portion by the latter
eminent anatomist.  We would earnestly recommend the reader interested in the most perfect
history that has ever appeared, of the extinction of a race of large animals, of which thousands
existed but three centuries ago, to refer to the original work.  We have only space enough
to state that the authors have proved, upon the most incontrovertible evidence, that the dodo
was neither a vulture, ostrich, nor galline, as previously anatomists supposed, but a 'frugiverous
pigeon'. I. -------------------
