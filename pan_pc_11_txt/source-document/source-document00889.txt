A HISTORY OF AERONAUTICS

by E. Charles Vivian

FOREWORD

Although successful heavier-than-air flight is less than two decades old, and successful dirigible
propulsion antedates it by a very short period, the mass of experiment and accomplishment renders
any one-volume history of the subject a matter of selection. In addition to the restrictions
imposed by space limits, the material for compilation is fragmentary, and, in many cases, scattered
through periodical and other publications. Hitherto, there has been no attempt at furnishing
a detailed account of how the aeroplane and the dirigible of to-day came to being, but each
author who has treated the subject has devoted his attention to some special phase or section.
The principal exception to this rule--Hildebrandt--wrote in 1906, and a good many of his statements
are inaccurate, especially with regard to heavier-than-air experiment.

Such statements as are made in this work are, where possible, given with acknowledgment to
the authorities on which they rest. Further acknowledgment is due to Lieut.-Col. Lockwood Marsh,
not only for the section on aeroplane development which he has contributed to the work, but
also for his kindly assistance and advice in connection with the section on aerostation. The
author's thanks are also due to the Royal Aeronautical Society for free access to its valuable
library of aeronautical literature, and to Mr A. Vincent Clarke for permission to make use
of his notes on the development of the aero engine.

In this work is no claim to originality--it has been a matter mainly of compilation, and some
stories, notably those of the Wright Brothers and of Santos Dumont, are better told in the
words of the men themselves than any third party could tell them. The author claims, however,
that this is the first attempt at recording the facts of development and stating, as fully
as is possible in the compass of a single volume, how flight and aerostation have evolved.
The time for a critical history of the subject is not yet.

In the matter of illustrations, it has been found very difficult to secure suitable material.
Even the official series of photographs of aeroplanes in the war period is curiously incomplete'
and the methods of censorship during that period prevented any complete series being privately
collected. Omissions in this respect will probably be remedied in future editions of the work,
as fresh material is constantly being located.

E.C.V. October, 1920.
