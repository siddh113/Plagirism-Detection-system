MY DEAR FRIEND,

Let me have the satisfaction of inscribing this volume to yourself. I know of no one who has
more faithfully devoted himself to the sacred cause of Christian Education: no one to whom
those blessed Truths are more precious, which of late have been so unscrupulously assailed,
and which the ensuing pages are humbly designed to uphold in their integrity.

Affectionately yours,

JOHN W. BURGON.

ΔΕΙ ΓΑΡ ΚΑΙ ἉΙΡΕΣΕΙΣ ἘΝ ὙΜΙΝ ΕΙΝΑΙ, ἹΝΑ ΟΙ ΔΟΚΙΜΟΙ ΦΑΝΕΡΟΙ ΓΕΝΩΝΤΑΙ ἘΝ ὙΜΙΝ.

Ac si diceret: Ob hoc hæreseôn non statim divinitus eradicantur auctores, ut probati manifesti
fiant; id est, ut unusquisque quam tenax, et fidelis, et fixus Catholicæ fidei sit amator,
appareat. Et revera cum quæque novitas ebullit, statim cernitur frumentorum gravitas, et levitas
palearum: tunc sine magno molimine excutitur ab areâ, quod nullo pondere intra aream tenebatur.--VINCENTIUS
LIRINENSIS, Adversus Hæreses, § 20.

PREFACE.

I am unwilling that this volume should go forth to the world without some account of its origin
and of its contents.

I. Appointed last year, (without solicitation on his part,) to the office of Select Preacher,
the present writer was called upon at the commencement of the October Term to address the University.
His Sermon, (the first in the volume,) was simply intended to embody the advice which he had
already orally given to every Undergraduate who had sought counsel at his hands for many years
past in Oxford; advice which, to say the truth, he was almost weary of repeating. Nothing more
weighty or more apposite, at all events, presented itself, for an introductory address: nor
has a review of the current of religious opinion, either before or since, produced any change
of opinion as to the importance of what was on that first occasion advocated.

Another, and another, and yet another preaching turn unexpectedly presented itself, in the
course of the same Term; and the IInd, IIIrd, and IVth of the ensuing Sermons, (preached on
alternate Sundays,) were the result. The study of the Bible had been advocated in the first
Sermon; but it was urged from a hundred quarters that a considerable amount of unbelief prevailed
respecting that very Book for which it was evident that the preacher claimed entire perfection
and absolute supremacy. The singular fallacy of these last days, that Natural Science, in some
unexplained manner, has already demolished,--or is inevitably destined to demolish[1],--the
Book of Divine Revelation, appeared to be the fallacy which had emerged into most offensive
prominence; and to this, he accordingly addressed himself.--It will not, surely, be thought
by any one who reads the IInd of these Sermons that its author is so weak as to look with jealousy
on the progress of Physical Science. His alarm does not arise from the cultivation of the noblest
study but one,--viz. the study of GOD'S Works; but from the prevalent neglect of the noblest
study of all,--viz. the study of GOD'S Word. His quarrel is not with the Professors of Natural
Science, but with those who are mere Pretenders to it. Moreover, he makes no secret of his
displeasure at the undue importance which has of late been claimed for Natural Science; and
which is sufficiently implied by the prevalent fashion of naming it without any distinguishing
epithet,--as "Science," absolutely: just as if Theology were not a Science also[2]!

It is not necessary to speak particularly of the contents of the next two Sermons; except to
say that the train of thought thus started conducted the author inevitably over ground which
was already occupied in the public mind by a volume which had already obtained some notoriety,
and which has since become altogether infamous. Enough of the contents of that unhappy production
I had read to be convinced that in a literary, certainly in a Theological point of view, it
was a most worthless performance; and I recognized with equal sorrow and alarm that it was
but the matured expression of opinions which had been fostering for years in certain quarters:
opinions which, occasionally, had been ventilated from the University pulpit; or which had
been deliberately advocated in print[3]; and which it was now hinted were formidably maintained,
and would be found hard to answer. Astonished, (not by any means for the first time in my life,)
at the apathy which seemed to prevail on questions of such vital moment, I determined at all
events not to be a party to a craven silence; and denounced from the University pulpit with
hearty indignation that whole system of unbelief, (if system it can be called,) which has been
growing up for years among us[4]; and which, I was and am convinced, must be openly met,--not
silently ignored until the mischief becomes unmanageable: met, too, by building up men in THE
TRUTH: above all, by giving Theological instruction to those who are destined to become Professors
of Theological Science, and are about to undertake the cure of souls.... In this spirit, I
asserted the opposite fundamental verities; and so, would have been content to dismiss the
"Essays and Reviews" from my thoughts for ever.

But in the meantime, the respectability of the authors of that volume had attracted to their
work an increasing share of notice. An able article in the 'Westminster Review' first aroused
public attention. A still abler in the 'Quarterly' awoke the Church to a sense of the enormity
of the offence which had been committed. It was not that danger was apprehended. There could
be but one opinion as to the essential impotence of the attack. But the circumstances which
aroused public indignation were twofold. First,--Here was a conspiracy against the Faith. Seven
Critics had avowedly combined "to illustrate the advantage derivable to the cause of Religious
and Moral Truth from a free handling, in a becoming spirit, of" what they were pleased to characterize
as "subjects peculiarly liable to suffer by the repetition of conventional language, and from
traditional modes of treatment[5]." They prefixed to their joint labours the expression of
a "hope that their volume would be received as an attempt" to do this. That their allusion
was to the Creeds, Articles, Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments,--was
obvious. Equally obvious was the un-becoming spirit, the arrogance and the hostility,--with
which all those sacred things were handled by those seven writers.

Secondly,--"Essays and Reviews" attracted notice because six of its authors were Ministers
of the Church of England. Here were six Clergymen openly making light of their sacred profession,
and apparently worse than regardless of their Ordination vows. As an infidel but certainly
in this instance most truthful as well as able Reviewer, remarked concerning the work in question,--"In
their ordinary, if not plain sense, there has been discarded the Word of GOD, the Creation,
the Fall, the Redemption, Justification, Regeneration, and Salvation, Miracles, Inspiration,
Prophecy, Heaven and Hell, Eternal punishment and a Day of Judgment, Creeds, Liturgies, and
Articles, the truth of Jewish History and of Gospel narrative; a sense of doubt thrown over
even the Incarnation, the Resurrection, and Ascension, the Divinity of the Second Person, and
the personality of the Third. It may be that this is a true view of Christianity; but we insist,
in the name of common sense, that it is a new view. Surely it is waste of time to argue that
it is agreeable to Scripture, and not contrary to the Canons[6]!"

This twofold phenomenon, which has shocked the public conscience and perplexed common sense,
has been the sole cause of the amount of attention "Essays and Reviews" has excited. Laymen
might have combined to produce this volume, almost unheeded. An obscure Clergyman might possibly
have published any one of these seven papers; and with a rebuke for his immorality or his insolence,
he would probably have been unnoticed by the world. But here is a combination of Doctors of
Divinity; Professors; Fellows, nay Heads of Colleges; Instructors of England's Youth; Teachers
of Religion; Chaplains to Royal and noble personages!

The Jesuitical notice prefixed to the book, (deprecating the idea that its authors should be
held responsible, except severally for their several articles,) completed the scandal. As if
seven men, each armed with his own appropriate weapon of violence, breaking into a house, and
spreading ruin around them, could "readily be understood," (to quote their own language,) to
incur each a limited responsibility!... Charity doubtless would have rejoiced to spread her
mantle over any one or more of the number, "who, on seeing the extravagantly vicious manner
in which some of his associates had performed their part, had openly declared his disgust and
abhorrence of such unfaithfulness, and had withdrawn his name[7],"--with some expression of
sorrow for the irreparable mischief which he had actively helped to occasion. But long before
nine editions of "Essays and Reviews" had appeared, it became apparent that each of the living
authors, (for one, alas, has already gone to his account!) has made himself responsible for
the whole work[8]. Nay, there are some of the number who make no secret of their satisfaction
at what has happened; and seem desirous only that their volume should obtain a yet wider circulation[9].

"Essays and Reviews," as already stated, with the turn of the year, experienced a vast increase
of notoriety. The entire Bench of Bishops condemned the book; and both Houses of Convocation
endorsed the Episcopal censure. A very careful perusal of the volume became necessary; and
it proved to be infinitely weaker in point of ability, infinitely more fatal in point of intention,
than could have been suspected from the known respectability and position of its authors. A
clamour also arose for a Reply to these Seven Champions,--not exactly of Christendom. "You
condemn: but why do you not reply?"--became quite a popular form of reproach.

It was useless to urge, in private, such considerations as the following:--To reply to a volume
of 433 pages, each of which contains a fallacy or a falsity,--while some pages are packed full
of both,--is a serious undertaking.--Besides, the book has been replied to already; for there
is scarcely an objection urged within its pages which was not better urged, and effectually
disposed of, in the last century. Nay, every good Review of "Essays and Reviews" has answered
the book: for what signify the details, if the fundamental lie has been detected, and unrelentingly
exposed? The man who plants his heel on the serpent's head, and refuses to withdraw it, can
afford to disregard the tortuous writhings of the long supple body.--Again. These attacks are
seven. Must seven men with "concert and comparison,"--with leisure and inclination too,--be
procured to demolish this flimsy compound of dogmatism and unbelief? to disperse these cloudy
doubts, and to analyse and repel these many ambiguous statements?--Once more. A fool can assert,
and in a moment, that 'There is no GOD.' But it requires a wise man to refute the lie; and
his refutation will probably demand a volume.--I say, it was in vain to urge such considerations
as these. "Why does no one reply to these 'Essays and Reviews?'" was asked,--till, I apprehend,
pens enough have been unsheathed to do the work effectually.

It struck me, in the meantime, that I should be employing myself not unprofitably at such a
juncture, if (laying aside all other work for a month or two) I were to attempt a short reply
to the volume in question, myself; and to combine it with the publication of the Sermons I
had already preached; and which I had the comfort of learning had not only been favourably
received by some of those who heard them, but had attracted some slight notice outside the
University also. Accordingly, with not a little reluctance, in the month of February I began.
The Destructive part of the argument, I determined to address to the younger members of my
own College,--men with whom I live in daily intimacy, and on terms of private friendship; and
whom, above all, I desired to protect against the influence of that "moral poison," (as the
Bishop of Exeter describes it,) of which the world has lately heard so much. The Constructive
part of the argument, I resolved to complete as opportunities might offer, in my Sermons. One
such opportunity presented itself early in Lent; of which I availed myself to establish some
fundamental truths relative to the Interpretation of Holy Writ[10]. By favour of the Vice Chancellor,
the promise of yet another preaching turn was obtained. It appeared best to avail myself of
the opportunity to consider the chief objections which have been brought against the Bible
from the marvellous character of some of its contents[11]. An University Sermon preached exactly
ten years ago, (on the Doctrine of Accommodation,) supplied an important link in the argument....
Thus the unscientific shape in which the present volume appears, is explained; and its want
of exact method is accounted for. Let me add, that but for the forward state of what I like
to regard as the Constructive part of the present volume,--(and which I am not without a humble
hope will secure for the rest a more than ephemeral interest,)--I should have been slow indeed
to undertake the distasteful task of answering a work of which I have long since been heartily
weary.

II. And now, for a few words on the general question which has called out these "Sermons" and
"Preliminary Remarks."

At the root of the whole mischief of these last days lies disbelief in the Bible as the Word
of GOD. This is the fundamental error. Dangerous enough is it to the moral and intellectual
nature of Man, when the authority of the Church is doubted: or rather, this is the first downward
step. Not to believe that Christ bequeathed to His Church a Divine form of polity: not to believe
that He set officers over His Kingdom, of which He is Himself the sole invisible Head: not
to believe that He invested His Apostles with authority to delegate to others the Commission
He had Himself conveyed to them; and that, by virtue of such transmitted powers, the Church
has authority in the Ministration of GOD'S Word and Sacraments: not to believe that He vouchsafed
to His Church extraordinary guidance at the first, and that He vouchsafes to His Church effectual
guidance still:--an utter want of faith in the Church and her Ordinances, is the first step,
I repeat, in a soul's downward progress.

Next comes an impatience of Creeds. It has been falsely asserted by an Essayist and Reviewer
that "Constantine inaugurated the principle of doctrinal limitation[12];" by which is meant
that definitions of Faith date from the Council of Nicæa, A.D. 325: the truth being that the
famous Oecumenical Council which was then held did but rule the consubstantiality of the SON
with the FATHER: whereas elaborate Creeds exist of a far earlier date; as all are aware. Creeds
indeed are coeval with Christianity itself[13]. What need to add that when the decree of the
first Oecumenical Council concerning the true faith in the adorable Trinity has been set at
nought, all other decisions of the Church are disregarded also?

That marvellous concrete fact, the Bible,--has next to be encountered. Unmethodical as it seems
to be, the Bible arrests a man in his impatient course with many a significant History,--many
an unmanageable precept. Much of its contents, it is true, are of such a nature that they may
be glossed over,--explained away,--ignored,--set aside. The reading is doubtful: or there are
two opinions, (perhaps twenty,) concerning it: or the language may be figurative: or the words
are not to be pressed too closely: or a perverse logic may pretend to find in it agreeable
confirmation, instead of stern reproof. Not a few places there are, however, which defy any
such handling; stubborn rocks which refuse to yield a single trace of the wished-for vegetation,
in return for the most determined husbandry. Nothing of the kind ever will or can be made to
germinate upon them. They are absolutely unmanageable, and hopelessly in the way of the man
who is determined to cast off restraint,--whether spiritual, intellectual, or moral. He is
for being lawless; or at least, without law: but the Bible is unmistakably an external Law,
and is opposed to him. The Bible is his enemy, and the Bible claims to be Divine.... What need
to state that to deny the Inspiration of the Bible, and to undermine its authority, and to
explain away its statements, becomes the next object of the unbeliever? It is precisely at
this stage of his downward progress that public attention is excited, and public indignation
aroused. The Church, (like its Divine Author,) may be outraged, and few will be found to remonstrate.
The Creeds may be assailed, (especially "one unhappy Creed!"), and it is hinted that these
are speculative matters, on which none should pronounce too dogmatically. But (thank GOD!)
Englishmen yet love their Bible; and Common Sense is able to see that an uninspired Bible is
no Bible at all. At the assault upon the Bible, therefore, as I said, an indignant outcry is
raised,--as now.

Systematically to cope with such irreverence, such entire ignorance rather of all the questions
at issue, from the pulpit, would be clearly impracticable. Men require to be taught "which
be the first principles." They require to be educated in Divinity. And thus we come back to
the fontal source of all the mischief of our own Day. We, in Oxford, give no systematic training
to our Candidates for Holy Orders. We do not even attempt it. Nay, incredible to relate, we
do not give them any training at all. And the fatal consequences of this omission are to be
seen on every side. A youth no sooner gets through "the Schools," and graduates in Arts, than
he inquires for a Curacy. During the three months, perhaps six, of interval, he makes himself
sufficiently acquainted with the Alphabet of Divinity to enable him to satisfy the very modest
requirements of the Bishop's examination; after which he finds himself at once actively engaged
in the Bishopric of souls and the profession of Theology. It is probable that the realities
of the Ministerial calling, and the eminently practical nature of such an one's daily life,
will keep this man from error. Not so his--more, shall I say, or less?--fortunate fellow-student;
who, by hard self-relying labour, having obtained distinction in the Schools, finds himself
in the enjoyment of a fellowship, and straightway engages in the work of tuition. This man,
whose fellowship is his "title" for orders, studies Divinity, or neglects it, at pleasure:
and if he studies it, he studies it in his own way. He has read a little of heathen Ethics
with great care; or he has trained himself to the exactness of mathematical inference. With
the purest idiom of ancient Greece he has also made himself very familiar. He is besides a
Master of Arts. What need to add that such an one is not therefore a Master of Divinity? possesses
no qualification which authorizes him to dogmatize about any one department of Theological Science?

The plain truth is, (and it is really better to speak plainly,)--the plain truth is, that the
offensive Sermons one sometimes hears from the University pulpit,--the offensive Essays and
Reviews which have lately occasioned so much public scandal,--are the work of men who discuss
that which they do not understand; profess that which they were never, at any time of their
life, taught. Their method of handling a text is altogether unique and extraordinary. Their
remarks concerning Divine things are even puerile. Their very citations of Scripture are incorrect.
Their cool affectation of superiority of knowledge, their claim to intellectual power, would
be laughable, were the subject less solemn and important. Speculations so feeble that they
sound like the cries of an infant in the dark, are insinuated to be the sublime views of a
bold and original thinker, who "has by a Divine help been enabled to plant his foot somewhere
beyond the waves of Time!"--Doubts so badly expressed that they read like the confused utterance
of one in his sleep, claim to be regarded as the legacy of one who is about to "depart hence
before the natural term, worn out with intellectual toil[14]!" ... In a word,--Men who have
never been taught and trained, but have grown up in a miserable self-evolved system of their
own,--(with a little of Hegel, and a little of Schleiermacher, and a little of Strauss,)--cannot
but trouble the peace of the Church. They deny her authority. (They are not aware of her claims.)
They cavil at her Creeds. (They are not acquainted with their history.) They doubt the authenticity
of the very Bible. (They know wondrous little about it.)--How did the Bible attain its actual
shape? They cannot tell. How has it been guarded? They are careless to inquire. How does it
come to us as 'the Bible,'--the Book of all books? It is best not to discuss a question which
must infallibly bring forward the Church as "a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ[15]." Men
are even impatient to publish their private prejudice that it is to be interpreted like any
other book; that it is inspired in no other sense than Sophocles and Plato. "The principle
of private judgment," (it is said,) "puts Conscience between us and the Bible, making Conscience
the supreme interpreter[16]." "Hence," it is said, "we use the Bible,--some consciously, some
unconsciously,--not to override, but to evoke the voice of Conscience." (p. 44.) "The Book
of this Law," (as Hooker phrases it,) is dethroned; and Man usurps the vacant seat, and becomes
a Law unto himself! GOD Himself is dethroned, in effect; and Man becomes his own god.

To cope systematically with all this from the University pulpit, as already remarked, is plainly
impossible. The preacher must take up the question at some definite stage, and arrest the false
teachers there. "That wicked,"--or rather "THE LAWLESS ONE," (ὁ ἄνομος, as he is called in
2 Thess. ii. 8,)--must be bound, hand and foot, somewhere in his career of lawlessness; and
in these Sermons the threshold of the Bible has been chosen as the place for the conflict.
My life for his life. I will slay or be slain on the very portal of Holy Scripture. With the
young, you begin at the beginning,--"the Creed, the LORD'S Prayer, the Ten Commandments;" and
they must be further instructed in the Church Catechism. But the foundation cannot be laid
afresh with the full-grown. It is idle to talk about the authority of the Church to men who
do not believe in the Bible. It is useless to dispute about Creeds with men who know nothing
of the origin and history of Christianity. Reserving the true method of teaching for those
who alone are capable of being taught, we are constrained to argue with men of full age about
the Inspiration and Interpretation of the Bible.--If in the ensuing Sermons the principles
handled are so very elementary, it is because the available limits were so very narrow,--while
the field over which Unbelief has spread itself, is so very broad.

III. When a few words have been added concerning the manner in which I have executed my task,
this Preface shall be brought to a close.--If the style of the present SERMONS,--considering
the auditory, and above all considering the subject,--shall be thought by competent judges
not sufficiently dignified in parts, I will bow to their decision without remonstrance. Everybody
can divine the defence which would be set up; but perhaps it may not be quite a valid defence.
A man feels strongly and warmly; writes fast and freely; is determined to be clearly understood:
is weary of the dignified conventionalities under which Scepticism loves to conceal itself
when it comes abroad. Perhaps some expressions which may be permitted in delivery, ought to
be remodelled when a Sermon is sent to the press.

But with regard to the ensuing PRELIMINARY REMARKS, I shall not so easily be persuaded to think
that I am mistaken as to the style in which Essayists and Reviewers are to be dealt with[17].
Some respectable persons, I doubt not, will think my treatment of them harsh and uncharitable.
I invite them to consider that we do not expect blasphemy from Ministers of the Gospel,--irreligion
from the teachers of youth,--infidelity from the Professor's chair: nor are we called upon
to tolerate it either. I have the misfortune to concur entirely with the verdict pronounced
by the Bishop of Exeter on the subject of 'Essays and Reviews.' Let those who feel little jealousy
for GOD'S honour measure out in grains their censure of a volume, the confessed tendency of
which is to sap the foundation of Faith, and to introduce irreligion with a flood-tide. Such
shall not, at all events, be my method. Private regard, if it is to weigh largely with him
who stands up for GOD'S Truth, should first have weighed a little with those by whom it has
been most grievously outraged. It may suit these Authors to wrap up their shameful meaning
in a cloud of words; but their Reviewer avails himself of that Christian liberty to which they
themselves so systematically lay claim, mercilessly to uncover their baseness, and uncompromisingly
to denounce it. If I may declare my mind freely, punctilious courtesy in dealing with such
opinions, becomes a species of treason against Him after whose Name we are called, and whom
we profess to serve. Seven men may combine to handle the things of GOD, it seems, in the most
outrageous manner; while themselves are to be the objects of consideration, tenderness, respect!
I cannot see their title to any consideration at all.

It will be found, it is hoped, that when these writers have the courage to descend to argument,
there I have gladly met them on their own ground, and sought to refute them: but to reason
is no part of their plan. Unsupported dicta on every subject on which they treat: doubts promiscuously
insinuated, but never once openly and honestly maintained: cool assumptions of intellectual
superiority for themselves and their infidel allies: contemptuous allusions to the names which
the respectable part of mankind agrees to hold in honour: foul imputations against the honesty
of the Clergy:--this is all their method! The favourite cant of these writers is, that no one
should shrink from free discussion, or fear the results of Criticism. Why then do not they
themselves criticize? Why do not they reason? Charity herself after weighing these Essays carefully
has no alternative but to assume that the Authors either have not the courage, or that they
lack the ability, to descend to a free discussion, and risk all on a stand-up fight. A kind
of guerilla warfare: half a dozen arrows, and a hasty retreat: such is their mode of attack!
But this method, though it may occasion annoyance, is quite unworthy of an honest inquirer,
and never can be decisive of anything. It is the cowardly expedient of men who shrink from
scrutiny, and dread exposure. Nothing so easy, for example, as to repeat the old commonplace
about "irreconcileable discrepancies" in the "Synoptical Gospels:" but why, instead, are we
not told, which these irreconcileable discrepancies are? For my own part, I freely renew in
this place the challenge I gave in my IIIrd Sermon[18]. Let any one of these Gentlemen publicly
and definitely lay his finger on one or more of these contradictory statements in the Gospels,
during term-time; and within a week I hereby undertake publicly to refute him in the Divinity
School of this University: and our peers shall be our judges.

Gentlemen who come abroad in the fashion above described, have no right to complain if they
encounter rough usage on the road. When Critics are clamorous for the "free handling" of Divine
Truth, they must not be surprised to find themselves freely handled too. If free discussion
is to be the order of the day, then let there be free discussion of "Essays and Reviews," as
well as of THE BIBLE. Six Clergymen of the Church of England who enter upon a crusade against
the Faith of the Church of England must not be astonished if they are looked upon in the light
of immoral characters, and treated as such. Accordingly, I have handled them just as freely
as they have handled the Prophets, Apostles, and Evangelists of CHRIST.

I cannot therefore pretend to offer anything in extenuation of the style in which I have examined
the statements of these Essayists and Reviewers. Perfectly sensible as I am of the gracefulness
of highly courteous language in controversial writing, I will not so far violate my own conviction
of what is right as to bandy compliments on such an occasion as this. This is no literary misunderstanding,
or I could have been amicable enough: no private or personal matter, or I could have flung
it from me with unconcern. No other than an attempt to destroy Man's dearest hopes, is this
infamous book: no other than an insult, the grossest imaginable, offered to the Majesty of
Heaven; an attack, the more foul because it is so insidious, against the Everlasting Gospel
of JESUS CHRIST. In such a cause I will not so far give in to the smooth fashion of a supple
and indifferent age, as to pay these seven writers a single compliment which they will care
to accept. The most foolish composition of the seven is Dr. Temple's; the most mischievous
is Professor Jowett's: but the germ of the last Essay is contained in the first; the foolishness
of the first Essay is abundantly shared by the last: while the evidence of correspondence of
sentiment between the two writers is unmistakable. The most unphilosophical Essay, (where all
are unphilosophical,) is Professor Powell's: the most insolent, Dr. Williams': the most immoral,
Mr. Wilson's: the most shallow, Mr. Goodwin's; the most irrelevant, Mr. Pattison's. Not one
of these writers shews himself capable of recognizing the true logical result of his own opinions:
of drawing from his own premisses their one inevitable issue. Not one of them has had the manliness
to speak out, and to say plainly what he means. They seem to deny the Divinity of CHRIST, and
the Personality of the HOLY GHOST: but how reluctant is a reader to believe that they really
mean it! Quite inevitable is it that these clerical critics must choose between two alternatives.
Either they hold opinions which make it impossible that they should retain Orders in the Church
of England, and yet be honest men; or they have expressed themselves with such culpable inaccuracy
and ambiguity, as shews that they are altogether incompetent to handle the Science of Theology.--Gladly
would one give them the benefit of a third alternative: but I see not that any remains.

If it should be thought strange that one thinking so meanly of 'Essays and Reviews' should
have produced a yet larger volume in reply to them, it must suffice to point out that the refutation
of a fallacy is almost of necessity the ampler writing.--Or again, if it be remarked that by
far the largest part of what I have written is directed against the hundred pages of Professor
Jowett, the explanation is still obvious. For not only does that concluding Essay of his bring
to a terribly practical issue the speculative doubts and difficulties which had been started
by all his predecessors; (namely, doubts as to (1) the relation in which the Bible stands to
Man;--(2) the nature of Prophecy;--(3) the reality of Miracles;--(4) the worth of Creeds and
formularies;--(5) the authenticity of Genesis;--(6) the basis on which Revelation is by the
Church of England supposed to rest;)--by proposing that we should henceforth regard the Bible
as a book no otherwise inspired than Sophocles and Plato:--not only does Professor Jowett's
essay discharge this fatal office; but his style is somewhat peculiar; and what he says, cannot
always be effectually disposed of by a few words. Let me explain.

There is a certain form of fallacy of statement in which this Gentleman's writings abound,
which calls aloud for notice and signal reprobation. He has a marvellous aptitude, (one would
fain hope through some intellectual infirmity,) of connecting together in the same sentence
two or three clauses; one or two of which shall be true as Heaven, while the other is false
as Hell. The reply to such a sentence is impossible, without many words,--far more than Mr.
Jowett's sentences commonly deserve.--Sometimes he strings together several heads of thought;
of which enumeration the kindest thing which can be said is that it betrays an utter want of
intellectual perspective. To unravel even a part of this tangled web so as to expose its argumentative
worthlessness, soon fills a page.... But there is another kind of fallacy which the same gentleman
wields with immense effect, and in the use of which he is a great master; which, because it
was absolutely impossible to handle it fitly in the proper place, shall be briefly adverted
to, here. I proceed to describe it not without indignation; for I am profoundly struck by the
intellectual perversity, not to say the moral obliquity, which has so entirely made this vile
instrument its own.

The fallacy then is of this nature. When Professor Jowett would put forth something especially
deserving of reprehension,--some sentiment or opinion which he either knows, or ought to know,
that the whole Church will resent with unqualified abhorrence,--he assumes a plaintive manner,
and puts himself into an interesting attitude; sometimes even folds his hands, as if in prayer.
He then begins by (1) throwing out a remark of real beauty, and so conciliating for himself
an indulgent hearing; or (2) he goes off on some Moral question, and so defeats attention;
or (3) he delivers himself of some undeniable truth, and so disarms censure; or (4) he says
something of an entirely equivocal kind, and so leaves his reader at fault. Candour, of course,
gives him the benefit of the doubt. It is not till the sentence is well advanced, or till it
is examined by the fatal light of its context, that one is shewn what the ambiguous writer
really was intending. A cloven foot appears at last; but it is instantly withdrawn, with a
shuffle; and you experience a scowl or a sneer, as the case may be, for your extreme unkindness
in inquiring whether it was not a cloven foot you saw?... Meanwhile, the learned Professor
has gone off in alia omnia, with a look of earnestness which challenges respect, and a vagueness
of diction which at once discourages pursuit and defeats inquiry. The fish invariably ends
by disappearing in a cloud of his own ink.

It shall suffice to have said thus much. These pages must now be suffered to go forth; not
without a hearty aspiration that a blessing may attend them from Him sine Quo nihil est validum,
nihil sanctum; and that what was intended for the strength and help of those who want helping
and strengthening, (I am thinking particularly of what has been offered on the subject of Inspiration,)
may not prove misleading or perplexing to any.

[3] In illustration of what is meant, may be particularized a highly objectionable Sermon which
Dr. Temple preached before the University some years ago, and which occasioned no small offence
to many who heard it,--as all in Oxford well remember. It was almost as unsound as the same
writer's Essay "On the Education of the World," which, to the best of my remembrance, it strongly
resembled.--A printed Sermon by Dr. Temple may also be referred to, "preached on Act-Sunday,
July 1, 1860, before the University of Oxford, during the Meeting of the British Association,"
entitled "The present Relations of Science to Religion."--Professor Jowett's handling of the
Doctrine of the Atonement, needs only to be referred to.

[6] 'Neo-Christianity' in the Westminster Review, No. 36.--How true is what follows:--"The
Bible is one; and it is too late now to propose to divide it. We shall only point out that
the moral value of the Gospel teaching becomes suspicious when the whole miraculous element
is discarded.

"We certainly do think that the Gospels assert a miraculous Incarnation, Resurrection, and
Ascension; and that the Epistles teach Original Sin, and a vicarious Sacrifice. If this be
doubted by our authors, it is sufficient for us to say that such is the impression they have
created on all ages of Christians."

"We desire that if the Bible, or any part of it be retained as Holy Writ, it be defended as
a miraculous gift to Man, and not by distorting the principles of modern Science. Let the Essayists
be assured that there exists no middle course; that there is no Inspiration more than is natural,
yet not supernatural; no Theology which can abandon its doctrines and retain its authority."

Lastly, with what sickening and almost Satanic power, does the same writer invite the Essayists
and Reviewers to make shipwreck of their souls in the following terrible passage. And yet,
who sees not that on their principles absolute and professed unbelief is inevitable? He says:--"How
long shall this last? Until men have the courage to bury their dead convictions out of sight,
and the greater courage to form new. All honour to these writers for the boldness with which
they have, at great risk, urged their opinions. But what is wanted is strength not merely to
face the world, but to face one's own conclusions. We know the cost. It must be endured. Let
each who has thought and felt for himself, ask himself first what he does not believe, and
then, if wise or needful, avow it. Next let him ask himself what he does believe, and pursue
it to its true and full conclusions. Neither loose accommodation nor sonorous principles will
long give them rest. It is of as little use to surrender the more glaring contradictions of
Science as it is to evaporate discredited doctrine into a few vague precepts. That end will
not be attained by our authors by subliming Religion into an emotion, and making an armistice
with Science. It will not be obtained by any unreal adaptation; nor by this, which is, of all
recent adaptations, at once the most able, the most earnest, and the most suicidal."

[8] The Bishop of Manchester exactly expressed the general opinion, when he said,--"Nor will
I for a single moment, however my personal feelings might interfere, conceal my deliberate
conviction that every partner in that work is equally guilty."--(Guardian, Ap. 10, 1861, p.
341.) But the most faithful language of all came from the Bishop of Exeter in his crushing
reply to an inquiry put to him by Dr. Temple. "I avow that I hold every one of the seven persons
acting together for such an object to be alike responsible for the several acts of every individual
among them in executing their avowed common purpose."

[9] A letter from Dr. Rowland Williams, which has appeared in the newspapers, contains the
following language with reference to the American reprint of "Essays and Reviews:"--"I confess
myself personally gratified that my own work, and that of my far more distinguished coadjutors,
with whom it is sufficient honour for me to be included in the same volume, should have obtained
the honour of a reprint in another hemisphere. Still more would I hail the circumstance as
an auspicious token of the sympathy which should prevail between kindred nations, as regards
subjects of the highest import, and as a sign of the prospects of Christian freedom beyond
the Atlantic....

"I have not yet discovered any community or individual possessing the right to cast the first
stone at those who interpret the Bible in freedom, and who subordinate its letter to its spirit,
or its parts to its whole. Even if Holy Scripture were, as is popularly fancied, the foundation,--and
not, as I believe, the expression and the memorial,--of Religious Truth in man, it would be
absurd to render it honours essentially different from those which it claims for itself, or
to make it a master, where it claims only to be a servant."

  In what sense Mr. Jowett's fundamental principle, (that
    "Scripture is to be interpreted like any other book,") may
    be cheerfully accepted                                            cxl

  Mr. Jowett's main assertion that "Scripture has one and only
    one true meaning," shewn to be founded on his assumption
    that the Bible is uninspired,--"like any other book"          cxlii

  1. Eight Characteristics of the Bible enumerated, which shew
    that it is unlike "any other book"                               cl

  But the distinctive characteristic of the Bible, is, that it
    professes to be the work of the HOLY GHOST                       clx

  Mr. Jowett's syllogism corrected, in consequence                  clxii

  2. Mr. Jowett's proposal accepted, that we should "Interpret
    Scripture from itself." Notion of Interpretation obtained
    from the volume of Inspiration                                clxii

  3. In addition to the testimony of Scripture, we have to
    consider the testimony of Antiquity                             clxix

  Remarks on primitive Patristic Interpretation                      clxx

  This part of the subject misunderstood by Mr. Jowett            clxxiii

  Remarks on primitive Tradition.--The Creeds, the records of
    Primitive Christianity                                        clxxvii

    that method of Interpretation which has been (=1=)
    Established by our LORD; (=2=) Employed by His Apostles;
    (=3=) Universally adopted by the primitive Church; and (=4=)
    Accepted by the most learned and judicious of modern

SERMON I.

  ST. JOHN vi. 68. LORD, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the
    words of Eternal Life.

  THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE RECOMMENDED; AND A METHOD OF STUDYING
    IT DESCRIBED.

  The Gospel, as a written message, meets with the same
    reception at the hands of the World now, as in the days of
    the Son of Man                                                      1

  Some points of analogy between the Written and the Incarnate
    WORD                                                                2

  Difficulties and seeming contradictions in the Gospel                 3

  Unattractive aspect.--Union of the Human and Divine                   4

  The Bible is generally little read.--Its preciousness                 6

  The age unlearned as well as unfaithful                               7

  Want of preparation for the Ministry.--The question of
    preparation narrowed to the duty of studying the Bible              8

  Conditions of successful Study:--a fixed time for reading the
    Bible, and a fixed quantity to be read                              9

  Vigilance, and independent inquiry                                   10

  Consecutive reading.--The first chapter of Genesis                   11

  Nothing to be skipped.--Result of such a method                      12

  The Bible is to be read, not in the same manner, but with at
    least the same attention, as a merely human work                   13

  A caution                                                            14

  Men not competent to make their own Religion out of the Bible        16

  The advantages of such a study of the Bible as has been here
    recommended, explained                                             17

  Absolute irrelevancy of objections drawn from the state of

SERMON V.

  ST. MATTHEW iv. 4.

  INTERPRETATION OF HOLY SCRIPTURE.--INSPIRED
    INTERPRETATION.--THE BIBLE IS NOT TO BE INTERPRETED LIKE ANY
    OTHER BOOK.--GOD, (NOT MAN,) THE REAL AUTHOR OF THE BIBLE.

  Interpretation described                                            140

  Three sources of Interpretation compared                            141

  Eusebius on "the Captain of the LORD'S Host"                        143

  The principle must be ascertained, on which Inspiration is to
    be conducted                                                      144

  How this is to be done                                              145

  This question may not be needlessly encumbered with
    difficulties                                                      147

  The HOLY SPIRIT'S method of Interpretation must be the true
    method                                                            148

  Specimens of Inspired Interpretation                                149

  The very narrative of Scripture mysterious                          152

  Divine exposition of the history of Melchizedek                     152

  Further proofs of the mysterious texture of Holy Scripture          156

  Moses wrote concerning CHRIST                                       157

  Two propositions established by the foregoing inquiry: (1) That
    the Bible is not to be interpreted like any other book:
    (2) That the meaning of Scripture is not always only one        160

  Scripture to be interpreted literally                               160

  The story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife remarked upon               162

  The Bible is the Word of GOD                                        163

  Bishop Butler on Inspiration                                        165

  Unbelief remonstrated with from the analogy of Nature and of
    Providence                                                        168

  How the inspired writers may be supposed to have understood

 PRELIMINARY REMARKS

 ON A VOLUME ENTITLED

 "ESSAYS AND REVIEWS:"

 ADDRESSED TO THE

 UNDERGRADUATE MEMBERS OF ORIEL COLLEGE.

My Friends,--I have determined to address to yourselves the present remarks; their subject,
a volume which has recently obtained such a degree of notoriety that it is almost superfluous
even to specify it by name.

With unfeigned reluctance do I mix myself up in this strife; but the course of events, when
I first took up my pen, left me almost without an alternative. Far more reluctant should I
be to seem to make yourselves the arbiters of Theological controversy. But in truth nothing
is further from my present intention. As a plain matter of fact, you are called upon weekly,
at St. Mary's, to listen to Sermons which indicate plainly enough the troubled state of the
religious atmosphere; and which, of late, (too frequently alas!) have inevitably assumed a
controversial aspect. The Sermons here published, (which form the constructive part of the
present volume,) were preached expressly with an eye to your advantage, and were intended to
warn you against (what I deemed) a very serious danger. It is only natural therefore that I
should desire to address to yourselves the present remarks likewise. You are, naturally, objects
of special solicitude to myself in this place,--you, with whom I live as among friends, and
for not a few of whom I entertain a sincere affection. And in addressing you, I am not by any
means inviting you to exercise your own theological judgment; for that would indeed be an absurd
proceeding. I am simply seeking to instruct you, and to guide you with mine.

The case of "Essays and Reviews" is, in fact, altogether exceptional,--whether the respectability
of its authors, the wickedness of its contents, or the reception which it has met with, is
considered. That volume embodies the infidel spirit of the present day. Turn where you will,
you encounter some criticism upon it. No advertizing column but contains repeated mention of
its name. To ignore so flagrant a scandal to the Church, is quite impossible. I have thought
it better, therefore, to encounter the danger in this straightforward way; and I proceed, without
further preamble, to remark briefly on each of the Seven "Essays and Reviews," in order.

I. The feeblest essay in the volume is the first. It is not without grave concern that I transcribe
the name of its amiable, and (in every relation of private life) truly excellent author,--"FREDERICK
TEMPLE, D.D., Chaplain in Ordinary to the Queen; Head Master of Rugby School; Chaplain to the
Earl of Denbigh." Under the imposing title of "THE EDUCATION OF THE WORLD," we are presented
with a worthless allegory, which has all the faults of a schoolboy's theme, (incorrect grammar
included;) and not one of the excellencies which ought to characterize the product of a ripened
understanding,--the work of a Doctor of Divinity in the English Church[19].

Dr. Temple's opening speculations are at once unintelligible, irrelevant, and untrue. But they
are immaterial; and serve only to lug in, (not to introduce,) the assumption that the "power,
whereby the present ever gathers into itself the results of the past, transforms the human
race into a colossal man whose life reaches from the Creation to the day of Judgment. The successive
generations of men are days in this man's life. The discoveries and inventions which characterize
the different epochs of the world's history are his works. The creeds and doctrines, the opinions
and principles of the successive ages, are his thoughts." [Alas, that the Creeds and Doctrines
of the Church should be spoken of by a Professor of Divinity as the "thoughts" of men!] "The
state of society at different times are (sic) his manners. He grows in knowledge, in self-control,
in visible size, just as we do. And his education is in the same way and for the same reason
precisely similar to ours. All this is no figure, but only a compendious statement of a very
comprehensive fact." (p. 3.) "We may then," (he repeats,) "rightly speak of a childhood, a
youth, and a manhood of the world." (p. 4.) And the process of this development of the colossal
man, "corresponds, stage by stage, with the process by which the infant is trained for youth,
and the youth for manhood. This training has three stages. In childhood, we are subject to
positive rules which we cannot understand, but are bound implicitly to obey. In youth we are
subject to the influence of example, and soon break loose from all rules, unless illustrated
and enforced by the higher teaching which example imparts. In manhood we are comparatively
free from external restraints, and if we are to learn, must be our own instructors. (p. 5.)--So
very weak an analogy, (where everything is assumed, and nothing proved,) singular to relate,
is drawn out into distressing tenuity through no less than 49 pages.

The ANSWER to all this is sufficiently obvious, as well as sufficiently damaging; and need
not be delayed for a minute.

That the Human Race has made considerable progress in Knowledge, from first to last,--is a
mere truism. That, in the civilized world, one generation is the heir of the generations which
went before it, is what no one requires to be told. Thus the discovery of the compass, of printing,
and of the steam-engine, have been epochs in human knowledge from which a start was made by
all civilized nations, without retrogression. But such facts supply no warrant for transforming
the whole Human Race into one Colossal Man; do not constitute any reason whatever why the 6000
years of recorded time should be divided into three periods corresponding with the Infancy,
Boyhood, and Manhood of an Individual.

To this theory, however, Dr. Temple even ostentatiously commits himself. It is the purpose
of his entire Essay, to establish the fanciful analogy already indicated,--which is proclaimed
to be "no figure" but a "fact." (p. 3.) But an educated man of ordinary intelligence, on reaching
p. 7, (where the writer first discloses his view,) summons the known facts of History to his
recollection; and before he proceeds any further, reasons with himself somewhat as follows:--

The Human Race had inhabited the Earth's surface for upwards of sixteen hundred years, when
it was destroyed by the waters of the Flood. After that, the descendants of Noah peopled the
earth's surface; a transaction of which the sole authentic record is to be found in the xth
chapter of the Book of Genesis. Egypt first emerged into importance,--as history and monuments
conspire to prove; having had a peculiar language and literature, Arts and Sciences, anterior
to the period of the Exodus, viz. B.C. 1491. Meanwhile, the chart of History directs our attention
to four great Empires: the Assyrian Empire, which was swallowed up by the Persian; and the
Persian, which was merged in the Grecian Empire. The Roman Empire came last. [How Law can be
considered to be the characteristic of all or any part of this period, I am at a loss to discover.
Neither do I see any indication of puling Infancy here.] These four great Empires of the world
had run their course when our SAVIOUR CHRIST was born. GOD sent His own Eternal SON into the
world; and lo, a change passed over the whole fabric of the world's polity. The old forms of
social life became, as it were, dissolved; or rather, a new spirit had been breathed into them
all. A new era had commenced; and a new principle henceforth animated mankind. That peculiar
system of Divine Laws which for 1500 years had separated the Hebrew race from all the nations
of the earth,--the Mosaic Law which had hitherto been the inheritance of a single family, isolated
in Canaan,--was explained and expanded by its Divine Author. The ancient promises to Abraham
and his posterity were declared in their application to be co-extensive with the whole race
of Mankind by faith embracing them. Henceforth, the kingdoms of the world were proclaimed the
kingdoms of CHRIST, and Mankind became for the first time subject to a written Law. The Laws
of CHRIST'S Kingdom, the doctrines of CHRIST'S Church, henceforth become supreme. Thus, when
a Christian Sovereign is crowned, the Bible is solemnly placed in his hands; and it is required
of him that he promise, on his oath, "to the utmost of his power, to maintain the Laws of GOD."
"When you see this Orb set under this Cross," (says the Archbishop, on delivering those insignia
of Royalty,) "remember that the whole World is subject to the power and empire of CHRIST our
Redeemer ... so that no man can reign happily, who ... directs not all his actions according
to His Laws." ... No further change in the order of things is anywhere intimated. The Faith
hath been ἅπαξ,--once and for ever,--delivered to the Saints. Forsaken, it may be: by many,
(alas!) it will be forsaken before the consummation of all things: but it will not itself cease.
Heaven and Earth shall pass away; but CHRIST'S Word, never. Not one jot nor one tittle of the
Law shall fail.... Such, in brief outline, is the World's true history,--past, present, future.
Does it correspond with Dr. Temple's account? That may be very soon seen. He calls the human
race a Colossal Man; and says that it passes through three stages,--Infancy, Boyhood, Manhood:
and that during those three stages, it is governed by three corresponding principles,--Law,
Example, Conscience. How does Dr. Temple establish the first?

The Jews, (he says,) were subject to Law from the period of the Exode to the coming of CHRIST.--We
listen to the statement of a familiar fact without surprise: but we are inclined to express
some stronger feeling than surprise when we discover that this is the whole of the proof concerning
the infancy of the Colossal Man! Does this writer then mean to tell us that the Jews were all
Mankind? If they were not the Colossal Man,--if, instead of being the whole Human Race, they
were one of the most inconsiderable and least known of the nations,--an isolated family, in
fact, inhabiting Canaan,--what becomes of the analogy? We really pause for an answer.... Such
a theory might have been expected, and would have been excusable if it had proceeded from a
Sunday-school-boy of fifteen,--who had read the Bible indeed, but who was unacquainted with
any book besides; and so, had jumped to the conclusion that the Jews were "the World." But
Dr. Temple is a Schoolmaster, and therefore must surely know better. If he is fanciful enough
to regard Mankind as a Colossal Man; and unphilosophical enough to consider that History is
capable of being divided into three periods,--corresponding with Infancy, Boyhood, and Manhood;
and forgetful enough of the facts of the case to assume that mankind was subject to Law until
the coming of CHRIST, thenceforward to be emancipated therefrom:--yet Dr. Temple ought not
to be so unreasonable as to pretend that Canaan was coextensive with the World,--the descendants
of Abraham with the posterity of Noah! This amiable writer is inexcusable for excluding from
the corporate entity of the Human Race the four great Empires of the world, (to say nothing
of primæval Egypt and mysterious India;) and for the sake of elaborating a worthless allegory,
identifying the least of all people with the Colossal Man, who, (according to his own account
of the matter,) represents the aggregate of all the nations.

Once more. The Mosaic Law was not given till B.C. 1491. But the world was then upwards of 2500
years old. Far more than one-third, therefore, of recorded time had already elapsed. How does
it happen that the theory under consideration gives no account of those 2500 years; or rather,
does not begin to be applicable, until they have rolled away?

Other inconveniences await this silly speculation. Thus, the Colossal Man, (who was under Law
from B.C. 1491 to the Christian æra,) proves to have been a marvellously precocious Infant.
He wrote the Song of Moses in the year of his birth. Nay, he built pyramids,--had a Literature,
Arts, and Sciences,--ages before he was born!... While yet an infant, he sang with Homer, and
carved with Phidias, and philosophized with Aristotle,--as none have ever sung, or carved,
or philosophized since. Times and fashions have altered, truly; but these three men are still
our Masters in Philosophy, in Sculpture, and in Song. Awkward fact, that the colossal Infant
should have lisped in a tongue which for copiousness of diction, and subtlety of expression,
absolutely remains to this hour without a rival in the world!

Again. At this writer's dogmatic bidding, we force ourselves to think of Mankind as a Colossal
Man, who has already gone through three ages,--Infancy, Boyhood, and Manhood. Old Age is therefore
to come next. When, (if it is a fair question,) may it be expected that the sad period of senile
decrepitude will set in? What proof, in the mean time, is there, (we venture to ask,) that
this period of decay has not begun already? Or does Dr. Temple perhaps imagine that the world
is moving in cycles, (to adopt the grotesque speculation of his own first pages); and that
after having run through the curriculum of Infancy, Boyhood, and Manhood, the Colossal Man,
(escaping, for some unexplained reason, the penalty of Old Age,) is to grow young again,--shake
his rattle and cut his teeth afresh? There is a childish vivaciousness, a juvenile recklessness,
a skittish impatience of restraint, in this amiable author's speculations, which powerfully
corroborate such a view of the case.

"The Childhood of the World was over when our LORD appeared on earth," (p. 20.) says Dr. Temple.
But when at last he is compelled to introduce to our notice his Colossal Child (p. 9, bottom.)
now developed into a Colossal Youth, he is painfully sensible that the Law and the Prophets,
(his schoolmasters,) (p. 8.) have not done their work quite so well as was to have been desired
and expected. Some apology is necessary, (p. 13, bottom.) Two great results however he claims
for their discipline:--"a settled national belief in the unity and spirituality of GOD, and
an acknowledgement of the paramount importance of chastity as a point of morals." (p. 11.)
Not however that the Law or the Prophets had taught them even this. (p. 10, top.) "It was in
the Captivity, far from the temple and the sacrifices of the temple, that the Jewish people
first learned that the spiritual part of worship could be separated from the ceremonial; and
that of the two the spiritual was far the higher." (p. 10.) At Babylon also the Jews first
distinctly learned the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. (p. 19.)--The Law, to be sure,
had emphatically said,--"Hear, O Israel, the LORD thy GOD is one GOD[20]." The prophets, to
be sure, had protested,--"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice[21]." The Law and the Prophets,
to be sure, are full of intimations that "mercy and not sacrifice[22]" is acceptable to the
GOD of Heaven, and that GOD'S Saints well understood the Doctrine[23]; as well as that a belief
in the soul's immortality was a part of the instruction of the Jewish people. But what is all
this to one who has an allegory to establish?...

The facts of the case, in the meantime, sorely perplex the truth-loving writer. "For it is
undeniable that, in the time of our Lord, the Sadducees had lost all depth of spiritual feeling,
whilst the Pharisees had succeeded in converting the Mosaic system into a mischievous idolatry
of forms." (p. 10.) "In short, the Jewish nation had lost very much when John the Baptist came."
(p. 11.) The hopelessly corrupt moral state of the youthful Colossus, described with such sickening
force and power by the great Apostle in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, cannot
have occurred to Dr. Temple's remembrance, for he says nothing about it. Certain withering
denunciations of "a wicked and adulterous generation[24];"--of "adulterers and adulteresses[25];"--"serpents,"
a "generation of vipers," which should hardly "escape the damnation of Hell[26];"--ought to
have reached him with a reproachful echo; but he is silent about them all. Still less would
it have suited the amiable allegorizer to state that just midway in the educational process,
his Colossal Youth, "as if" the sins of Samaria and of Sodom "were a very little thing," "was
corrupted more than they in all his ways. As I live, saith the LORD GOD," (apostrophizing Dr.
Temple's Colossal Youth, in allusion to his character and conduct in the middle of his infant
career,) "Sodom thy sister hath not done as thou hast done: ... neither hath Samaria committed
half thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they.... Bear thine own
shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they. They are more righteous
than thou[27]!" "Ah sinful nation, laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that
are corrupters!... From the sole of the foot even unto the head,"--[these words, remember,
are addressed to the Colossal Infant just midway in his career; and Heaven and Earth are called
upon to give ear, "for the LORD hath spoken!" ... From the sole to the crown,] "there is no
soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores.... Your hands are full of blood[28]!"
... About all this hideous retrospect of what was going on at school, Dr. Temple is silent.

In like manner, the great fact that our REDEEMER came to republish His own two primæval ordinances,--the
spiritual observance of the Sabbath and the sanctity of Marriage,--is quietly ignored. A youth
utterly degraded by sensuality[29], and blinded by unbelief[30], is a terrible picture truly.
Dr. Temple therefore boldly gives the lie direct to History, sacred and profane; and insists
that "side by side with freedom from idolatry, there had grown up in the Jewish mind a chaster
morality than was to be found elsewhere in the world:" (p. 12:) that "in chastity the Hebrews
stood alone; and this virtue, which had grown up with them from their earliest days (!!!) was
still in the vigour of fresh life when they were commissioned to give the Gospel to the nations."
(p. 13.)

Behold the Colossal Child therefore, now grown into a Colossal "Youth too old for discipline."
(p. 20, bottom.) "The tutors and governors have done their work;" (p. 20;) and he is now to
go through a distinct process of training. Three tutors are now brought in to give the finishing
touches to the youth's education, and to inaugurate his new career. Rome, Greece, and Asia,--which
for some unexplained reason never become (according to Dr. Temple) any part of the Colossal
Man at all,--now come in; "Rome to discipline the human will; Greece, the reason and taste;
Asia, the spiritual imagination." (p. 19.) The Law and the Prophets had disciplined the Colossal
Child's conscience,--with what success we have seen. At all events, Moses and Isaiah are for
infants: we have passed the age for such helps as they could supply. In a word,--"The childhood
of the world was over when our Lord appeared on earth." (p. 20.) It was "just the meeting-point
of the Child and the Man; the brief interval which separates restraint from liberty." (p. 22.)
"It was time that the second teacher of the Human Race should begin his labours. The second
teacher is EXAMPLE:" (p. 20:) and "the period of youth in the history of the world, when the
human race was, as it were, put under the teaching of example, corresponds, of course, to the
meeting point of the Law and the Gospel. The second stage therefore in the education of man
was the presence of our LORD upon earth." (p. 24.)

Let not this stage of Dr. Temple's allegory suffer by being stated in any language besides
his own. "The world" had been a Colossal Child for 1490 years. It was to be a Youth for almost
100. "The whole period from the closing of the Old Testament to the close of the New was the
period of the world's youth,--the age of examples: and our LORD'S presence was not the only
influence of that kind which has acted upon the human race. Three companions were appointed
by Providence to give their society to this creature whom GOD was educating, Greece, Rome,
and the Early Church." (p. 26.) Behold then, our Blessed Redeemer with His "three companions."
(I reproduce this blasphemous speculation with shame and sorrow.) What kind of Example He was,
Dr. Temple omits to inform us. But Greece was "the brilliant social companion;"--Rome, "the
bold and clever leader;"--the Early Church was "the earnest, heavenly-minded friend." (p. 26.)
We are warned therefore against supposing that "our Lord's presence was the only influence
of that kind," (i.e. example,) appointed by Providence for the creature whom God was educating.
In a word: "The world was now grown old enough to be taught by seeing the lives of Saints,
better than by hearing the words of Prophets." (pp. 28-9.)

We come now to the conclusion of the allegory; and Dr. Temple shall again speak for himself.
"The age of reflection begins. From the storehouse of his youthful experience the Man begins
to draw the principles of his life. He is the third great teacher and the last." (p. 31.)

And now, it will reasonably be asked,--May not the head-master of Rugby write a weak and foolish
Essay on a subject which he evidently does not understand, without incurring so much not only
of public ridicule, but of public obloquy also? If his own sixth-form boys do not laugh at
him, need the Church feel aggrieved at what he has written? Where is the special irreligion
in all this?

I answer,--The offence is of the very gravest character; and in the course of what follows,
it will appear with sufficient plainness wherein it consists. For the moment,--singly considered,--it
is my painful duty to condemn Dr. Temple's Essay on the following grounds.

Whereas the Church inculcates the paramount necessity of an external authoritative Law to guide
all her members;--Creeds to define the foundation of their Faith,--a Catechism to teach them
the necessary elements of Christian Doctrine,--the several forms of Prayer contained in the
Prayer Book to instruct them further in Religion, as well as to prescribe their exact mode
of worshipping ALMIGHTY GOD: whereas too the Church requires of her ministers subscription
to Articles "for the avoiding of Diversities of Opinions, and for the establishing of Consent
concerning true Religion;"--above all, since all Christian men alike are taught to acknowledge
the external guidance of the Divine Law itself contained in Holy Scripture,--and every Minister
of the Church of England is further called upon to admit the authority of that Divine Law as
it is by the Church systematized, explained, upheld, enforced:--notwithstanding all this, Dr.
Temple, who has solemnly taken the vows of a minister of the Church of England, and writes
after his name that he is Sacræ Theologiæ Professor, in his present Essay more than insinuates,
he openly teaches that Man "draws the principles of his life," (not from Revelation, but) "from
the storehouse of experience:" that we live in an age when "the spirit or conscience having
come to full strength, assumes the throne intended for him in the soul." This "spirit or conscience"
"legislates without appeal except to himself." "He is the third great teacher and the last."
(p. 31.) The world, in the days of its youth, could not "walk by reason and conscience alone:"
(p. 21:) but it is not so with us, in these, the days of the world's manhood. "The spiritual
power within us ... must be the rightful monarch of our lives." (p. 14.) We, (he says,) "walk
by reason and conscience alone." (p. 21.)

Now this is none other than a deliberate dethroning of GOD; and a setting up of Self in His
place. "A revelation speaking from without and not from within, is an external Law, and not
a spirit,"--(p. 36,) says Dr. Temple. But I answer,--A revelation speaking from within, and
not from without, is no revelation at all. "The thought of building a tower high enough to
escape GOD's wrath, could enter into no man's dreams," (p. 7,) says Dr. Temple in the beginning
of his Essay, in derision of the Old World. But he has carried out into act the very self-same
thought, himself; and his "dreams" occupy the foremost place in 'Essays and Reviews.' He teaches,
openly, that henceforth Man must learn by "obedience to the rules of his own mind." (p. 34.)
He is express in declaring that "an external law" is for the age which is past, (pp. 34-5.)
Ours is "an internal law;" "which bids us yield,"--not to the revealed Will of GOD, "but,--to
the majesty of truth and justice; a law which is not imposed upon us by another power, but
by our own enlightened will." (p. 35.) In this, the last stage of the Colossal Man's progress,
Dr. Temple gives him four avenues of learning: (1) Experience, (2) Reflection, (3) Mistakes,
(4) Contradiction. By withholding from this enumeration the Revealed Will of GOD, and the known
sanctions of the Divine Law, he thrusts out GOD from every part of his scheme; denies that
He is even one of the present teachers of the Human Race,--explaining that the time has even
gone by when CHRIST could teach by example[31],--"for the faculty of Faith has turned inwards,
and cannot now accent any outer manifestations of the truth of GOD[32]." (p. 24.)--By this
Essay, Dr. Temple comes forward as the open abettor of the most boundless scepticism. Whether
or no his statements be such as Ecclesiastical Courts take cognizance of, is to me a matter
of profound unimportance. In the estimation of the whole Church, it can be entitled to but
one sentence. "We use the Bible," (he tells us,) "not to override, but to evoke the voice of
conscience." (p. 44.) "The current is all one way,--it evidently points to the identification
of the Bible with the voice of conscience. The Bible, in fact, is hindered by its form from
exercising a despotism (!) over the human spirit; if it could do that, it would become an outer
law at once." (p. 45.) Even if men "could appeal to a revelation from Heaven, they would still
be under the Law (!!!); for a Revelation speaking from without, and not from within, is an
external Law, and not a Spirit." (Ibid.)--Even those who look upon the observance of Sunday
"as enjoined by an absolutely binding decree," are reproached as "thus at once putting themselves
under a law." (p. 44.) ... Dr. Temple has written an Essay which he calls "an argument," and
for which he claims "a drift." (p. 31.) That argument is neither more nor less than a direct
assault on the Faith of Christian men; and carried out to its lawful results, can lead to nothing
but open Infidelity;--which makes it a very solemn consideration that the author, (whose private
worth is known to all,) should be a teacher of the youth of Christian England. That drift I
deplore and condemn; and no considerations of private friendship, no sincere regard for the
writer's private worth, shall deter me from recording my deliberate conviction that it is wholly
incompatible with his Ordination vows.

I forbear to dive into the depth of irreligion and unbelief implied in what is contained from
p. 37 to p. 40, and other parts of the present Essay: but I cannot abstain from asking why
does this author,--who, in all the intercourse of private life, is so manly a character,--fall
into the unmanly trick of his brother-Essayists, of insinuating what they dare not openly avow?
The great master of this cloudy shuffling art is Mr. Jowett. Even where he and his associates
in "free handling," are express and definite in their statements, yet, as their rule is prudently
to abstain from adducing a single example of their meaning, it is only by their disingenuous
reticence that they escape punishment or exposure. Thus, Dr. Temple speaks of "many of the
doctrinal statements of the early Church" being "plainly unfitted for permanent use;" (p. 41;)
but he prudently abstains from explaining which of those "doctrinal statements" he means. He
goes on to remark:--"In fact, the Church of the Fathers claimed to do what not even the Apostles
had claimed,--namely, not only to teach the Truth, but to clothe it in logical statements ...
for all succeeding time." He is evidently alluding to "the forms in which the first ages of
the Church defined the Truth;" [i.e. to the Creeds;] of which he says, we "yet refuse to be
bound by them." (p. 44.) He goes on,--"It belongs to a later epoch to see 'the law within the
law' which absorbs such statements into something higher than themselves." (p. 41.) But the
writer of that sentence ought to have had the manliness to explain what that "higher something" is.

Dr. Temple's estimate of the corruptions of the Papacy is of a piece with the rest of what
I must be excused for calling a most unworthy performance. "Purgatory," &c. (he says) "was
in fact, neither more nor less than the old schoolmaster come back to bring some new scholars
to CHRIST." (p. 42.) (Is the Romish fable of Purgatory then to be put on the same footing as
the Divine Revelation to Moses on Sinai?) It follows,--"When the work was done, men began to
discover that the Law was no longer necessary." (Ibid.) (Is it thus that the head-master of
Rugby accounts for, and explains the Reformation?) "The time was come when it was fit to trust
to the conscience as the supreme guide." (Ibid.) "At the Reformation, it might have seemed
at first as if the study of theology were about to return. But in reality an entirely new lesson
commenced,--the lesson of toleration. Toleration is the very opposite of dogmatism." (p. 43.)
"Its tendency is to modify the early dogmatism by substituting the spirit for the letter, and
practical religion for precise definitions of truth." (Ibid.) "The mature mind of our race
is beginning to modify and soften the hardness and severity of the principles which its early
manhood had elevated into immutable statements of truth. Men are beginning to take a wider
view than they did. Physical science, researches into history, a more thorough knowledge of
the world they inhabit, have enlarged our philosophy beyond the limits which bounded that of
the Church of the Fathers. And all these have an influence, whether we will or no, on our determinations
of religious truth. There are found to be more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt
of in patristic theology. GOD'S creation is a new book to be read by the side of His revelation,
and to be interpreted as coming from Him. We can acknowledge the great value of the forms in
which the first ages of the Church defined the truth, and yet refuse to be bound by them."
(p. 43-4.) ... Who so unacquainted with the method of a certain school as not to understand
the fatal meaning of generalities, false and foul as these?

       *       *       *       *       *

It may occur to some persons to inquire whether St. Paul, in a well-known place, does not affirm,
(somewhat as it is affirmed in this Essay,) that "the heir, as long as he is a child, ... is
under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father?" Does not St. Paul also
go on to reproach men for "turning again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto they
desired to be again in bondage?" saying, "ye observe[33] days, and months, and times, and years[34]."
It is quite true that St. Paul says all this: and I would fain believe that a puerile misconception
of the Apostle's meaning has betrayed the misguided author of the present Essay into a notion
that he enjoys a species of Divine sanction for what he has written concerning "the Education
of the World." I may add that St. Paul also declares, (in the same Epistle,) that "the Law
was our pædagogus to bring us to CHRIST.... But after faith is come, we are no longer under
a pædagogus[35]."

But it does not require much knowledge of Divinity to make a man aware that St. Paul's meaning
and intention is as widely removed from Dr. Temple's, as Truth is removed from falsehood: or
rather, that the Apostle is flatly against him. St. Paul is not bent on explaining what has
been the Education of the World, but on pointing out in what relation the Gospel of CHRIST
stands to the Law of Moses. He is reproving men who, having been converted to Christianity,
were for lapsing into Judaism. Certain of the Circumcision had been striving, in St. Paul's
absence, to bring his Galatian converts under the bondage of the Levitical Law; assuring them
that the Gospel would avail them nothing unless they were circumcised and obedient to the Jewish
ritual. Hence the Apostle's vehemence, and the peculiar form which his instruction assumes.

The Christian dispensation, (the scheme of Man's Justification by Faith in CHRIST,) is the
fulfilment, (St. Paul says,) of the covenant which GOD once solemnly made with Abraham. The
Mosaic Law, (which was not given till 430 years after the time of Abraham,) is powerless to
cancel that earlier covenant of Faith. What was the use of the Law, then? some one may ask.
It was a supplementary, parenthetical, superadded thing, which came in, as it were, accidentally,
for certain assignable purposes. But now that the original covenant of Faith has at length
found fulfilment in the person of CHRIST, it were monstrous (argues the Apostle) to revert
to Judaism: which was a species of prison-house where we suffered bondage until MESSIAH came
to set us free. We were as prisoners, says the Apostle. We were also as children, (who, anciently,
from the age of six to fourteen, used to be consigned by their father to the care of a slave
called a 'pædagogus;' who was neither qualified nor allowed to teach them anything; but whose
office it was to conduct them to school.) So brought to the School of CHRIST, where learning
comes by Faith, (such is his argument,) let men beware how they revert to the carnal ordinances
of the Jewish Law.

How different a view of our true state is thus discovered, from that which Dr. Temple describes!
A glorious liberty is in reserve for us indeed[38]: a precious freedom is ours already. But
it bears no resemblance whatever to that lawlessness (ἀνομία) with which Dr. Temple seems to
be enamoured. It is the correlation of slavery, not of obedience. It implies emancipation from
the Levitical Law, not from the sanctions, however strict, of the Christian Church. The Doctrines
of Christ's kingdom are the Christian's crown and joy. His "service is perfect freedom," and
imparts to life all its sweetness.--Not only, therefore, (according to St. Paul's view of the
matter,) were men not released from school at "the meeting point of the Law and the Gospel,"
(p. 24,) but they only began to go to School then[39]!

How different a view of the Education of the World does the HOLY SPIRIT,--does our LORD Himself--furnish,
from that which Dr. Temple here advocates!... Fallen, in the person of Adam, and made subject
to the penalty of eternal death, behold Mankind from the very first taught to believe that
they should be ultimately redeemed by One born of woman. Under the image of a son who remained
in his father's house, the favoured descendants of Abraham are set before us: while the rest
of the world is pourtrayed in the person of another son, who goes into a far country, and there
wastes his substance with riotous living. Not when grown into a colossal "youth too old for
discipline," (p. 20, bottom,) but in the day of his dire necessity, and when he begins to be
sensible of his utter need, behold the heathen nations, (in the person of the poor prodigal,)
arising, and going to their true Father, and in the fulness of their misery asking for a hired
servant's place in the household. Behold too GOD'S mercies in CHRIST set forth by "the first
robe," (that robe of innocence which when Adam lost he knew that he was naked!) and the ring,
and the shoes, and the fatted calf! Lastly, in the embrace which the Father, (while yet the
offending but repentant son is a long way off,) runs to bestow,--behold how GOD loved the World!

But Dr. Temple may say,--My parable relates to one person: that which you have quoted pourtrays
two, and thus all parallelism is lost. (In other words, our LORD'S picture of "the Education
of the World" is altogether unlike Dr. Temple's!)--Take, however, a parable which ought to
suit exactly; for in it mankind are exhibited in the person of "a certain man."

This individual is represented as one who, as he travels, is by thieves stripped, wounded,
and left half dead. Such then, by nature, is the state of the human race! Priest and Levite,
who "look on him," but "pass by on the other side," set forth the Education of the World (!)
until CHRIST came. A certain Samaritan, who has compassion on the naked and wounded wretch,
goes to him, binds up his wounds, pours in oil and wine, sets him on his own beast, brings
him to the inn, and takes care of him:--this one is CHRIST. The stranger's pence, and his promise
to repay at his second coming what shall have been over-expended,--set forth, I suppose, that
ministration of CHRIST'S Word and Sacraments which Dr. Temple exercises.... Let me dismiss
the subject by remarking that I find no countenance given by Holy Scripture to Dr. Temple's
monstrous notions concerning the Infancy, the Youth, and the Manhood of the Colossal Man.

Our SAVIOUR CHRIST is indeed set before us in Scripture as our great Exemplar[40]; and St.
Paul calls upon us to be followers, or rather imitators, (μιμηταί), of himself; even as he
was of CHRIST[41]. But this walking by example, did not supersede the walking by precept; neither
was it to endure, (GOD forbid!) (as Dr. Temple emphatically says it was), (pp. 26: 28-9,) only
for about a hundred years: still less was "Example," (the second Teacher of the Human Race,)
straightway to find itself supplanted by "the Spirit or Conscience" of Man,--"the third great
Teacher, and the last." What need to say that until His Second Coming to judge the world, we
shall have no Teacher but CHRIST,--no other way proposed to us to walk in, but that which the
Gospel discloses?

Neither is it true that the world has been old enough, for the last 1800 years, to be taught
by "seeing the lives of Saints," (a sentiment worthy of the weakest of Romanists!) "better
than by hearing the words of Prophets." (pp. 28-9.) The Church of CHRIST will for ever listen
to the blessed accents of that "goodly fellowship," until she beholds Him by whose Spirit they
spake[42], coming again to judgment. True that the object with which she will all along inform
her children, will ever be that they may become conformed to the model of her Divine LORD.
But "sound doctrine[43],"--embodied in a "form of sound words[44],"--constitutes that παρακαταθήκη,
or "deposit," which is her proudest inheritance and her greatest treasure[45]: and impatience
of it is a note of evil men, and of a season at which Prophecy points her awful finger[46]....
"Lawlessness," (ἀνομία,) is discoursed of by the SPIRIT with a mysterious earnestness which
it seems to me impossible to survey without mingled awe and terror lest one may become oneself
involved in the threatened condemnation. I allude of course especially to what St. Paul says
in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians; the language of which, to be understood, must be
studied in the original[47].

Conscience has her office, doubtless; and a most important one it is. Conscience is the very
candle of the LORD within us. But, (as I have elsewhere shewn,) it were base treason to speak
of conscience as Essayists and Reviewers speak of it. With them, it is indeed impossible to
argue. They must first withdraw from the cause which they have betrayed; cease to profess the
teaching which they disbelieve; resign their commission in a Church to whose Doctrine and Discipline
they openly proclaim themselves to be opposed. I will not argue with them, while they presume
to write B.D. and D.D. after their names,--hold Chaplaincies,--preside over Schools and Colleges,--profess
to lecture in Divinity,--officiate at the altars of the Church of England,--by virtue of their
sacred office, and by virtue of that only, are instructors of youth. They cannot, (if they
are in the full enjoyment of their faculties,) they cannot imagine, for a moment, that, as
honest men, they can remain where they are! They must either recal their words or resign their
stations!

But speaking to others, it will abundantly suffice to point out that such principles as the
present Essay advocates are incompatible with the profession of Christianity in any country,
and in any age. If the spirit or conscience of Man is to legislate "without appeal except to
himself;" (p. 31;) if men are to "refuse to be bound" (p. 44.) by the Creeds of the Church;
if the very Bible is not to be looked upon as "an outer law:" (p. 45:)--how is sentence ever
to be pronounced with authority? how are men to know what they have to believe? how are we
to enjoy the guidance of any "outer law" at all? I do not ask these questions as a clergyman;
neither am I addressing those exclusively who have been admitted to the Christian priesthood.
Common sense, ordinary piety, natural reverence, seem to cry out, and ask,--If the Church have
no "authority in controversies of Faith[48];" if the three Creeds ought not "thoroughly to
be received and believed[49];" if the Bible is not "an outer Law;"--where is Authority in things
Divine to be sought for? What can be worthy of credit? Where are we to look for external guidance
on this side the grave?... Surely, surely, common sense is outraged when she hears it insisted
that the written Bible is a Revelation speaking NOT "from without," but "from within!" (pp.
36 and 45.) Surely it must be admitted that it were mere atheism to pretend that Man's "spirit
or conscience, without appeal except to himself," shall henceforth be the governing principle
of Mankind!

Let me in conclusion do this writer an act of justice, (for which he will not perhaps altogether
thank me,) even while with shame and sorrow I now dismiss his Essay. Unpardonable as he is
for having written thus; and wholly without excuse for having suffered nine editions of his
blasphemous allegory to go forth to the world without apology, explanation, or retractation
of any kind,--although he labours under a weight of competent censure without a parallel, I
believe, in the annals of the English Church[50]: notwithstanding all this, I am bound to say
that if the unbelievers of this generation think they have an ally in the man, Frederick Temple,--they
are very much mistaken. That so pure a heart, and earnest a spirit, will never work itself
free of its present bondage,--I should be sorry indeed to think. (But O the mischief which
the head-master of Rugby School will have done in the meantime!) His misfortune (or rather
fault) it has been, that he has really never studied Divinity; nor, in fact, knows anything
at all about it,--as a volume of his, lately published, sufficiently shews. Apart from his
opinions (!), he is a thoroughly amiable man; and--(with the same proviso!)--an excellent schoolmaster;
but when he ventures upon the province of Theology, he shews himself something infinitely worse
than a very bad Divine.

II. On turning the first page of the review which follows, "by ROWLAND WILLIAMS, D.D. Vice-Principal
and Professor of Hebrew, St. David's College, Lampeter; Vicar of Broad Chalke, Wilts,"--we
are made sensible that we are in company of a writer considerably in advance of Dr. Temple,
though altogether of the same school. In fact, if Dr. Williams had not been Vice-Principal
of a Theological College, and a Doctor of Divinity, one would have supposed him to be a complete
infidel,--who found it convenient to vent his own unbelief in a highly laudatory review of
the principles of the late Baron Bunsen. Hear him:--"When Bunsen asks 'How long shall we bear
this fiction of an external Revelation,'--that is, of one violating the heart and conscience,
instead of expressing itself through them;--or when he says, 'All this is delusion for those
who believe it; but what is it in the mouths of those who teach it?'--Or when he exclaims,
'Oh the fools! who, if they do see the imminent perils of this age, think to ward them off
by narrow-minded persecution'!--and when he repeats, 'Is it not time, in truth, to withdraw
the veil from our misery? to tear off the mask from hypocrisy, and destroy that sham which
is undermining all real ground under our feet? to point out the dangers which surround, nay,
threaten already to engulf us?'--there will be some who think his language too vehement for
good taste. Others will think burning words needed by the disease of our time. These will not
quarrel on points of taste with a man who in our darkest perplexity has reared again the banner
of Truth, and uttered thoughts which gave courage to the weak and sight to the blind. If Protestant
Europe is to escape those shadows of the twelfth century which with ominous recurrence are
closing around us, to Baron Bunsen will belong a foremost place among the champions of light
and right." (pp. 92-3.)

But even the Prussian infidel is not advanced enough for the Vicar of Broad Chalke. Bunsen,
it seems, was weak enough to believe that the prophet Jonah was a real personage. This evokes
the following singular burst of critical indignation from the Reverend author of the present
Essay:--"It provokes a smile on serious topics,"--(a kind of impropriety which the Vice-Principal
of Lampeter will not commit except under protest and with an apology!)--"to observe the zeal
with which our critic vindicates the personality of Jonah, and the originality of his hymn,
(the latter being generally thought doubtful), while he proceeds to explain that the narrative
of our book in which the hymn is imbedded, contains a late legend founded on misconception.
One can imagine the cheers which the opening of such an essay might evoke in some of our circles,
changing into indignation (!) as the distinguished foreigner developed his views. After this
he might speak more gently of mythical theories." (p. 77.)

For the most part, however, the Vicar of Broad Chalke is able to cite the opinions of Bunsen
with admiration and approval. They are both agreed that the Deluge "was but a prolonged play
of the forces of fire and water rendering the primæval regions of North Asia uninhabitable,
and urging the nations to new abodes." (Of what nature this "prolonged play" was, is however
left unexplained: while "the forces of fire and water rendering primæval regions uninhabitable,"
and "urging nations to new abodes," has altogether a Herodotean sound.) "We learn approximately
its antiquity, and infer limitation in its range from finding it recorded in the traditions
of Iran and Palestine, (or of Japheth and Shem), but unknown to the Egyptians and Mongolians."
(p. 56.) (A delightful method truly of attaining historical precision in a matter of this nature!)
... "In the half ideal, half traditional notices of the beginnings of our race compiled in
Genesis, we are bid notice the combination of documents and the recurrence of barely consistent
Genealogies." (Ibid.) Praise is at hand for "the firmness with which Bunsen relegates the long
lives of the first patriarchs to the domain of legend, or of symbolical cycle." (p. 57.) "The
historical portion begins with Abraham." (Ibid.)--After this admission, it is instructive to
observe how the learned writer deals with the narrative. The Exode was "a struggle conducted
by human means." (p. 59.) "Thus, as the pestilence of the Book of Kings becomes in Chronicles
the more visible angel, so the avenger who slew the firstborn may have been the Bedouin host,
(!) akin nearly to Jethro, and more remotely to Israel." (Ibid.) (It is really hardly worth
stopping to point out that by 'Kings' the Reverend writer means 'the second Book of Samuel:'
and to remind the reader that the Angel is mentioned as expressly in Samuel as in Chronicles[51].
Also, to ask what 'the Bedouin host' could have been doing in Egypt previous to the Exode?)
"The passage of the Red Sea may be interpreted with the latitude of poetry." (Ibid.) "Moses
would gladly have founded a free religious society, ... but the rudeness or hardness of his
people's heart compelled him to a sacerdotal system and formal tablets of stone." (p. 62.)
Nay, Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac was an act of obedience to "the fierce ritual of
Syria, with the awe of a Divine voice:" (p. 61:) while the Divine command, in conformity with
which Abraham spared to slay his son, is resolved into an allegory. "He trusted that the FATHER,
whose voice from Heaven he heard at heart, was better pleased with mercy than with sacrifice,
and this trust was his righteousness." (p. 61.) Dr. Williams straightway shews us how we may
tread in the steps of faithful Abraham. The perpetual response of our hearts, (he says,) to
principles of Reason and Right of our own tracing, is a truer sign of faith than deference
to a supposed external authority. (p. 61.) ... According to this writer, therefore, Genesis
and Exodus are pure fable!

The whole of Scripture, in the hands of this Doctor of Divinity, undergoes corresponding treatment.
They who "twist Prophecy into harmony with the details of Gospel history, fall into inextricable
contradictions." (pp. 64-5.) "The Book of Isaiah, as composed of elements of different eras,"
can only be accepted with a "modified theory of authorship and of prediction." (p. 68.) In
the prophecy of Zechariah are "three distinct styles and aspects of affairs." (Ibid.) "The
cursing Psalms," (!!!) he informs us, were not "evangelically inspired;" (p. 63;) and yet we
are constrained to remember that the cixth Psalm (specially alluded to) is evangelically interpreted
by St. Peter[52]. The true translation of Psalm xxii. 17, (learnedly discussed, long since,
by Bishop Pearson,) is not "they pierced My hands and My feet,"--but "like a lion;" (notwithstanding
that Pearson has shewn that the substitution of vau for yod in this place is one of the eighteen
instances where the Scribes have tampered with the text[53]; and notwithstanding that this
modern corruption of the Hebrew, as every one must see, makes the place almost nonsense[54].)--Is.
vii. 14 does not refer to the miraculous birth of CHRIST, (p. 69,) (although St. Matthew is
express in his assertion that it does.) There is, it seems, an elder and a later Isaiah, (p.
71.) The famous liiird chapter does not refer to CHRIST; but either to Jeremiah or to "the
collective Israel,"--(p. 73,) (although it is at least seven times quoted, and expressly applied
to our SAVIOUR, in the New Testament[55].) Daniel, we are assured, belongs to different ages;
and it is "certain, beyond fair doubt ... that those portions of the book, supposed to be specially
predictive, are ... a history of past occurrences." (p. 69.) That "the book contains no predictions,
except by analogy and type, can hardly be gainsaid." (pp. 76-7.) ... (If any of us had dogmatized
as to Truth as these men do as to error, (remarks Dr. Pusey,) what scorn we should be held
up to!) ... The Reverend author insolently adds,--"It is time for divines to recognize these
things, since with their opportunities of study, the current error is as discreditable to them,
as for the well-meaning crowd, who are taught to identify it with their creed, it is a matter
of grave compassion." (p. 77.) "When so vast an induction on the destructive side has been
gone through, it avails little that some passages may be doubtful; one perhaps in Zechariah,
and one in Isaiah, capable of being made directly Messianic; and a chapter possibly in Deuteronomy
foreshadowing the final fall of Jerusalem. Even these few cases, the remnant of so much confident
rhetoric, tend to melt, if they are not already melted, in the crucible of searching enquiry."
(pp. 69-70.) ... Our Doctor of Divinity, having reduced the prophecies "capable of being made"
Messianic, to two,--breaks out into a strain of refined banter which is altogether his own,
and which we presume is intended to stand in the place of argument. "If our German, [viz. Bunsen,]
had ignored all that the masters of philology have proved on these subjects, his countrymen
would have raised a storm of ridicule, at which he must have drowned himself in the Neckar."
(p. 70.) A catastrophe so fatal to the cause of true Religion and sound learning may well point
a paragraph!... But we must write gravely.

The absolute worthlessness of unsupported dicta such as these, ought to be apparent to all.
It is useless to reason with a madman. We desiderate nothing so much as "searching enquiry,"
(p. 69,) but we are presented instead with something worse than random assertion. If the writer
would state a single case, with its evidence,--we should know how to deal with him. We should
examine his arguments seriatim; and either refute them, or admit their validity. From such
"free handling," the cause of sacred Truth can never suffer. But when, in place of argument
and evidence, we have merely bluster,--what is to be said? Pity and disregard are the only
reply we can bestow; or our answers must be as brief as the calumny which provokes them. "How,"
(asks the Regius Professor of Hebrew,) "can such an undigested heap of errors receive a systematic
answer in brief space, or in any one treatise or volume?"

"If any sincere Christian now asks, is not then our SAVIOUR spoken of in Isaiah; let him open
his New Testament, and ask therewith John the Baptist, whether he was Elias? If he finds the
Baptist answering I am not, yet our LORD testifies that in spirit and power this was Elias;
a little reflexion will shew how the historical representation in Isaiah liii. is of some suffering
prophet or remnant, yet the truth and patience, the grief and triumph, have their highest fulfilment
in Him who said, 'FATHER, not My will but Thine.'" (p. 74.) I have transcribed this passage
to illustrate the miserable sophistry of the author. It is foretold by Malachi that before
the great and terrible day of the LORD, Elijah is to come back to Earth[56]. John Baptist came
in his "spirit and power[57]," but was not Elijah himself. How does it follow from this that
Isaiah may have prophesied merely of qualities and not of a person? The only logical inference
from his words would surely be, that Elijah is yet to come[58]!--Dr. Williams adds,--"We must
not distort the prophets to prove the Divine WORD incarnate, and then from the Incarnation
reason back to the sense of prophecy." (p. 74.) Was not then the Divine WORD incarnate?

The theory of one who writes like an open unbeliever concerning Divine things is really not
worth developing: and yet, as I am examining an Essay which seems to be entirely built upon
such a theory, it may be desirable, in this instance, that the deformity of the writer should
be uncovered: especially since Dr. Williams writes such very dark English, that, until some
of his sentences are translated, they are barely intelligible.

Anticipating that his doctrines may "alarm those who think that, apart from Omniscience belonging
to the Jews, (!) the proper conclusion of reason is Atheism;"--(in other words, that the rejection
of a belief in the inspiration of Prophecy will eventually conduct a man to the rejection of
GOD Himself;) the Reverend writer declares that "it is not inconsistent with the idea that
ALMIGHTY GOD has been pleased to educate men and nations, employing imagination no less than
conscience, and suffering His lessons to play freely within the limits of humanity and its
shortcomings." (p. 77.) (In other words, that what Scripture emphatically declares, and what
men have for thousands of years believed to be inspired predictions of future events, are none
other than the effusions of a lively imagination, or the suggestions of a well-informed conscience.)
"The prophetical disquisitions," (p. 77,) therefore, are subject to error of every imaginable
description; and possess no higher attributes than belong to any ordinary human work by "a
master's hand." (p. 77.) "The Sacred Writers acknowledge themselves men of like passions with
ourselves, and we are promised illumination from the Spirit which dwelt in them." (p. 78.)
We may not think of the Sacred Writers as "passionless machines, and call Luther and Milton
'uninspired.'" (Ibid.) "The great result is to vindicate the work of the Eternal Spirit; that
abiding influence which underlies all others, and in which converge all images of old time
and means of grace now: temple, Scripture, finger, and Hand of GOD; and again, preaching, sacraments,
waters which comfort, and flame which burns." (p. 78.) It follows,--"If such a Spirit did not
dwell in the Church, the Bible would not be inspired, for the Bible is, before all things,
the written voice of the congregation." (p. 78.) Offended Reason, (for Piety has no place here,)
has not time to reclaim against so preposterous a statement; for it follows immediately,--"Bold
as such a theory of Inspiration (!) may sound, it was the earliest creed of the Church, and
it is the only one to which the facts of Scripture answer." (p. 78.) ... What reply can be
offered to such an outrageous statement, but flat contradiction? What more effectual refutation
of such a 'theory' (?) concerning Scripture, than simply to state it?

Let this miserable but conceited man yet further map out the nature of his own delusion respecting
Prophecy. He applauds the wisdom of one who "accepts freely the belief of scholars, and yet
does not despair of Hebrew Prophecy as a witness to the Kingdom of God:" (p. 70:) (that is,
of one who, like Bunsen, altogether disbelieves in prophecy as prophecy, and yet is bent on
finding something of an Evangelical character in the prophetic writings.) "The way of doing
so left open to him, was to shew pervading the Prophets those deep truths which lie at the
heart of Christianity, and to trace the growth of such ideas, the belief in a righteous GOD,
and the nearness of Man to GOD, the power of prayer, and the victory of self-sacrificing patience,
ever expanding in men's hearts, until the fulness of time came, and the ideal of the Divine
thought was fulfilled in the Son of Man." (p. 70.) In other words, CHRIST was nothing more
than the fullest development and impersonation of the best thoughts and feelings of the (so-called)
prophets! He "fulfilled in His own person the highest aspiration of Hebrew seers and of mankind,
thereby lifting the ancient words, so to speak, into a new and higher power; and therefore
was recognized as having eminently the unction of a prophet whose words die not,--of a priest
in a temple not made with hands,--and of a king in the realm of thought, delivering his people
from a bondage of moral evil, worse than Egypt or Babylon." (pp. 74-5.) "A notion of foresight
by vision of particulars, or a kind of clairvoyance," (p. 70,)--(such is this Doctor of Divinity's
notion of the gift of prophecy!)--he deems inadmissible. "Literal prognostication," (p. 65,)
is his abhorrence. He would eliminate the Messianic passages altogether. (pp. 65-6.) That Prophecy
was miraculous, was a dream of the Fathers, (p. 66.) Even the notion that Prophecy is "a natural
gift, consistent with fallibility," (p. 70,) Dr. Williams rejects as an unwarrantable addition
to the "moral and metaphysical basis of Prophecy." (p. 70.) Bunsen was for admitting that addition.
"One would wish," (says the Vicar of Broad Chalke,) "he might have intended only the power
of seeing the ideal in the actual, or of tracing the Divine Government in the movements of
men. He seems to mean more than presentiment or sagacity: and this element in his system requires
proof." (pp. 70-1.) ... This, from a Doctor of Divinity! a Professor of Hebrew! the Vice-Principal
of a Theological College! a shepherd of souls!

We are left to infer that "the Fall of Adam represents ideally the circumscription of our spirits
in limits of flesh and time:" (p. 88:) that CHRIST is "the moral Saviour of mankind;" (p. 80;)
and that Salvation from evil is to be attained by the conformity of our souls to a "religious
idea" which was "brought to perfection" in CHRIST. (p. 80.) This "religious idea" "is the thought
of the Eternal." (Ibid.) In other words, "Salvation from evil" is "through sharing the SAVIOUR's
Spirit." (p. 87.)--We are further left to infer that "Justification by faith means the peace
of mind, or sense of Divine approval, which comes of trust in a righteous GOD:" (p. 80:) that
"Regeneration is a correspondent giving of insight, or an awakening of forces of the soul:
Resurrection, a spiritual quickening: Salvation, our deliverance, not from the life-giving
GOD, but from evil and darkness." (p. 81.) ... And this from a Clergyman who has just subscribed,
"willingly and ex animo," the three Articles in the 36th Canon!... After such specimens of
Divinity, we are scarcely surprised to find that the fires of Hell γέεννα "may serve as images
of distracted remorse:" (p. 81:) that "Heaven is not a place[59], so much as a fulfilment of
the love of GOD." (pp. 81-2.) The very Incarnation, (which he calls "the embodiment of the
Eternal Mind,") (p. 82.) is spoken of as if it were a myth. "It becomes with our author as
purely spiritual as it was with St. Paul. The Son of David by birth is the SON of GOD by the
spirit of holiness. What is flesh, is born of flesh; and what is spirit, is born of Spirit."
(p. 82.) Rom. i. 1-3 is quoted in support of this, which I cannot but regard as blasphemy:
for if it does not mean that our SAVIOUR was not, in a true and literal sense, the SON of GOD
at all, it is hard to see what it can mean.--As for the following account of the mystery of
the Blessed Trinity, it shall only be said that it sounds like a denial of the Catholic doctrine
altogether. "Being, becoming, and animating; or substance, thinking, and conscious life, are
expressions of a Triad which may be also represented as will, wisdom, and love; as light, radiance,
and warmth; as fountain, stream, and united flow; as mind, thought, and consciousness; as person,
word, and life; as FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT." (p. 88.)

The nebulous is a striking peculiarity of the style of the Vicar of Broad Chalke[60]. He informs
us that "in virtue of the identity of Thought with Being the primitive Trinity represented
neither three originant principles nor three transient phases, but three eternal subsistences
in one Divine Mind.... The Divine Consciousness or Wisdom, consubstantial with the Eternal
Will, becoming personal in the Son of Man, is the express image of the FATHER; and JESUS actually,
but also Mankind ideally, is the SON of GOD." (pp. 88-9.) Since this has "almost a Brahmanical
sound" (p. 89.) even to the Vicar of Broad Chalke, we are content to pass it by in mute astonishment.
He proceeds: "Both spiritual affection and metaphysical reasoning forbid us to confine Revelations
like those of CHRIST to the first half century of our era; but shew at least affinities of
our faith existing in men's minds, anterior to Christianity, and renewed with deep echo from
living hearts in many a generation." (p. 82.) Was our SAVIOUR then a fabulous personage,--a
virtuous principle,--and not a Man?... "Again. We find the evidences of our canonical books
and of the patristic authors nearest to them, are sufficient to prove illustration in outward
act of principles perpetually true, but not adequate to guarantee narratives inherently incredible
or precepts evidently wrong." (pp. 82-3.) Are then the sacred "narratives" "inherently incredible?"
or the Divine "precepts" "evidently wrong?"--These are, we presume, among the "traditional
fictions about our Canon" (p. 83.) at which the Theological Professor sneers. "Hence we are
obliged to assume in ourselves a verifying faculty,"--(p. 83,) and so, Dr. Williams and Dr.
Temple shake hands[61]. An instance of the exercise of this faculty is immediately subjoined.
"The verse 'And no man hath ascended up to Heaven, but he that came down,' is intelligible
as a free comment near the end of the first century; but has no meaning in our Lord's mouth
at a time when the Ascension had not been heard of." (p. 84.)--"The Apocalypse" in like manner,
to "cease to be a riddle," must be "taken as a series of poetical visions which represent the
outpouring of the vials of wrath upon the City where our LORD was slain." (p. 84.) ... (Is
it possible that a Minister of the Gospel of CHRIST can speak thus concerning the Divine record?)
... "The second of the Petrine Epistles, having alike external and internal evidence against
its genuineness, is necessarily surrendered as a whole." (p. 84.) (Can a man solemnly sign
the vith Article, and yet so write?)--"A philosophical view [of the doctrine of the Trinity]
recommends itself as easiest to believe." (p. 87.) The "view" expressed in the Athanasian Creed
is we presume that which is stigmatized as "one felt to be so irrational, that it calls in
the aid of terror." (p. 87.) The Reverend writer does not name the Athanasian Creed, indeed.
It is not the general fashion of Essayists and Reviewers,--from Dr. Temple to Professor Jowett,--to
speak plainly. But common sense asks,--If Dr. Williams does not allude to the Creed in question,
what does he allude to? And common honesty adds,--How is such an allusion to that formula consistent
with subscription to Art. viii.?

The Sacrament of Baptism, (he says,) has "degenerated into a magical form," (p. 86,) since
it has "become twisted into a false analogy with circumcision,"--(twisted, at all events, by
St. Paul[62]!)--and it is merely an "Augustinian notion" that "a curse is inherited by Infants."--How,
one humbly asks, does the Reverend writer reconcile it to his conscience not only to have signed
the ixth Article, but to employ the Baptismal Service, and to teach the little ones of the
flock their Catechism?

On reaching the last page of the present Essay, one is irresistibly led to remark that if a
single word could convey an adequate notion of the author's manner, that word would be Insolence.
When Dr. Williams would express difference of opinion, he has recourse to violence and bluster:
when he would patronize, he is sure to make himself unspeakably offensive. But he seldom agrees
with anybody, even with disciples of the same school with himself,--as Messrs. Bunsen and Arnold,
Coleridge and Francis Newman. Professor Mansel is "a mere gladiator hitting in the dark," whose
"blows fall heaviest on what it was his duty to defend." (p. 67.) Dr. Pusey receives a menacing
intimation of what his Commentary must not be. Davison's reasoning labours under the inconvenient
defect of an unproved minor premiss. (p. 66.) The majestic memory of Bp. Pearson is insulted
by this vulgar man, and the fairness of his citations are impeached. (p. 72.)--Bp. Butler is
declared to have turned aside from an unwelcome idea (!), literature not being his strong point
(!) (p. 65.)--Justin, (p. 64,)--Augustine, (p. 65,)--Jerome, (pp. 65, 71,)--Anselm, (p. 67,)--all
come in for a share of the Vice-Principal of Lampeter's contempt. Even the Apologist of Essays
and Reviews is constrained to admit that "anything more" unbecoming "than some of Dr. Williams's
remarks we have never read, in writings professing to be written seriously[63]."

But faults of mind and manner, however gross, do but disqualify a writer for being the associate
of men of taste and good breeding; and blemishes of style are, at least, venial. Not so easily
to be excused is the deplorable spectacle of a Minister of the Gospel, a Doctor of Divinity
and Vice-Principal of a Theological College, lending all his critical powers, (which yet seem
to be of the most indifferent description,) in order to undermine the authority of GOD'S Word.
He has been asked,--"Do you unfeignedly believe all the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament?" and he has answered,--"I do believe them." He has been asked, "Will you be
ready, with all diligence, to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary
to GOD'S Word?" and he has made reply,--"I will, the LORD being my helper." He has solemnly
declared his trust that he was "inwardly moved by the HOLY GHOST to take upon himself this
office and ministration."--Yet this is the man who explains away Miracles, denies Prophecy,
and idealizes Scripture; the man who disparages the formulæ he uses daily, mutilates the Canon,
and evacuates the most solemn doctrines of the Church!

I have now said as much as I think necessary concerning Dr. Williams's Essay. The entire refutation
of such a tissue of groundless assertions and unfounded statements, and unscholarlike criticisms,
and unphilosophical views,--would fill many volumes. It is to be feared also that, to him,
the result would not be convincing after all. To have stated in brief outline, as I have already
done, the leading positions to which he commits himself, ought to suffice. The mere exhibition
of such principles (?) ought to be their own abundant refutation.... GOD give the unhappy author
repentance of his errors!--And will not men believe that in the pages of the present Essay
is to be seen the lawful development, and inevitable result of the opinions advocated in every
other part of the present volume? I perceive scarcely any essential difference between the
views of any of these seven writers. All are moving along the same fatal road; and are simply
at different stages of the journey. But they conduct themselves wondrous differently in their
progress, certainly; Dr. Williams being immeasurably the most offensive of the seven,--the
only one who, besides seeming blasphemous, can truly be called vulgar.

III. The third Essay in the present volume is by "the REV. BADEN POWELL, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian
Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford,"--a gentleman with whose labours I shall
deal briefly and gently for two reasons. His assertions admit of summary refutation; and he
has already, (alas!) passed beyond the limit of earthly Criticism. I desire to add concerning
him, that in the private relations of life he was a friendly and amiable person.

The solemn circumstance already adverted to, would have kept me silent altogether. When a writer
is no longer able to defend himself, it is ungenerous to attack him: and at a time when he
knows far more wonders than are dreamed of by any one on the Earth's surface, it seems unbecoming
to stand reasoning over his grave about an "antecedent probability." But I am addressing not
the dead, but the living,--to whom, in the pages of 'Essays and Reviews,' Professor Powell
"being dead yet speaketh."

He entitles his contribution,--"On the Study of the Evidences of Christianity:" but, as often
happens with performances of the like nature, the title of his Essay gives a wrong notion of
its contents. It ought to have been called "The Validity of THE EVIDENCE FROM MIRACLES considered,"
or rather "denied."

There is nothing new in the present attack on the Miracles of Scripture. The author disposes
of them by a single assertion. "What is alleged," (he says,) "is a case of the supernatural.
But no testimony can reach to the supernatural." (p. 107.) The inference is obvious.--Again:
"an event may be so incredible intrinsically as to set aside any degree of testimony." (pp.
106-7.) This merely amounts to asserting that the antecedent improbability of Miracles is so
great as to make them incredible. The writer does not attempt to establish this point. "The
present discussion," (he says,) "is not intended to be of a controversial kind; it is purely
contemplative and theoretical." (p. 100.) And yet, he cannot suppose that the Universal Church
will surrender its convictions and reverse its deliberate judgment, at the merely "contemplative
and theoretical" suggestions of an individual, however respectable he may happen to be. Against
his mere assertion, we claim a right to set the result of Bp. Butler's careful investigation
of the same subject:--"That there certainly is no such presumption against Miracles, as to
render them in any wise incredible: that, on the contrary, our being able to discern reasons
for them, gives a positive credibility to the history of them, in cases where those reasons
hold: and that it is by no means certain that there is any peculiar presumption at all, from
analogy, even in the lowest degree, against Miracles, as distinguished from other extraordinary
phenomena[64]."

Professor Powell's objection against Miracles is, in fact, practically that of the infidel
Hume; who asserted "that no testimony for any kind of Miracle can ever possibly amount to a
probability, much less to a proof." He argued that Miracles, being contrary to general experience,
are incapable of proof. He maintained also, (with Spinoza,) that Miracles, being contrary to
the established laws of Nature, imply, in the very character of them, a palpable contradiction.
This latter position seems to be identical with that adopted by Professor Powell.

In a certain place, this author finds fault with "the too frequent assumption ... of the part
of the ... Advocate, when the character to be sustained should be rather that of the unbiassed
Judge." (p. 95.) But what are we to think of the judicial fairness of one who is not only Advocate
and Judge in his own cause; but who even turns the Witnesses out of Court; and will listen
to no evidence,--on the plea that it cannot be trustworthy; or at least, that it shall be unavailing?--"I
express myself with caution," (says Bp. Butler, with reference to arguments against the credibility
of Revelation,) "lest I should be mistaken to vilify Reason; which is indeed the only faculty
we have wherewith to judge concerning anything, even Revelation itself: or be misunderstood
to assert that a supposed revelation cannot be proved false, from internal characters. For
it may contain clear immoralities, or contradictions; and either of these would prove it false.
Nor will I take upon me to affirm, that nothing else can possibly render any supposed revelation
incredible. Yet still the observation is, I think, true beyond doubt; that objections against
Christianity, as distinguished from objections against its evidence, are frivolous[65]."

That a certain occurrence or phenomenon "is due to supernatural causes," Professor Powell maintains
is "entirely dependent on the previous belief and assumptions of the parties." (p. 107.) He
forgets that he grounds his own denial of the possibility of a Miracle, on nothing stronger
than "the nature of" his own "antecedent convictions." Thus, the question becomes merely a
personal one between Mr. Baden Powell and the Apostles of CHRIST. The reasonableness of the
"antecedent convictions" in the one case have to be set against the reasonableness of the "antecedent
convictions" in the other. Either party, (according to this view,) has its own "previous belief
and assumptions;" which, in the one case, are known to have produced conviction; in the other,
they are unhappily found to have resulted in a rejection of Miracles. But then it happens,
unfortunately, that in the case of the Apostles and others, conviction of the truth of our
LORD'S Miracles was based on knowledge, and experience of a matter of fact: in the case of
Professor Powell, disbelief is founded on certain "antecedent convictions" only: namely, "the
inconceivableness of imagined interruptions of natural Order, or supposed suspensions of the
Laws of matter." (p. 110.) He is never tired of repeating that "in an age of physical research
like the present, all highly cultivated minds and duly advanced intellects (!) have imbibed,
more or less, the lessons of the Inductive Philosophy; and have, at least in some measure,
learned to appreciate the grand foundation conception of universal Law:" (p. 133:) that "the
entire range of the Inductive Philosophy is at once based upon, and in every instance tends
to confirm, by immense accumulation of evidence, the grand truth of the universal Order and
constancy of natural causes, as a primary law of belief; so strongly entertained and fixed
in the mind of every truly inductive inquirer, that he cannot even conceive the possibility
of its failure." (p. 109.)

I gladly avail myself of a page from the writings of a thoughtful writer of our own, who, half
a century ago, reviewed the very errors which are being so industriously reproduced among ourselves
at this day,--certainly not with more ability than of old:--"Let us examine a little farther
into the weight of the argument derived from the supposed immutability of the Laws of Nature.
It has constantly been the theme of modern Unbelievers, that the course of Nature is fixed,
eternal, unalterable; and that nothing which is supposed to violate it can possibly take place.
Now, we may readily allow, that the course of Nature is unalterable by human power; nay, even
by the power of any created being whatsoever. But the question is,--Are these Laws unalterable
by Him who made them? Proof of this is requisite, before the argument from the immutability
of the Laws of Nature can have the least force. We may safely assert, however, that proof of
this is absolutely impossible.--'Facts,' it may be said, 'daily passing before us, warrant
us in supposing its laws to be unchangeable.' Perhaps so. But if a thousand or more facts have
occurred, since the Creation of the World, in which those Laws appear to have been over-ruled,
or suspended, is such a conclusion then warrantable? Even if there had never been a single
instance of a Miracle recorded, since the Creation; yet the conclusion would not be just or
logical, that no such thing is possible. But with such a multiplicity of instances to the contrary
as are already on record, it is no better than a shameless assertion, in direct opposition
to the evidence of men's senses and experience. Nay, more; the argument is atheistical. For,
either GOD made and ordained these Laws of Nature; and may, consequently, at His pleasure,
unmake or suspend them: or else, these laws are self-framed, and Nature is independent of the
GOD of Nature; which is saying, in other words, that the material Universe is not governed
by any Supreme Intelligence.

"This latter opinion appears, indeed, to be the tenet of all who resort to arguments of this
kind, in opposition to the credibility of Miracles. Thus it is said, [by Hume,] that every
effect must have a cause; and that, therefore, a Miracle must have a cause in Nature; otherwise,
it cannot be effected.--But, is not the Will of GOD, without any other agency, or predisposing
cause, sufficient for the purpose? When GOD created the World out of nothing, what pre-existing
cause was there, except His own omnipotent Will to produce the effect? Why then is not the
same Will sufficient to work Miracles?

"'But,' says another Sophist, [Spinoza,]--'GOD is the Author of the Laws of Nature; so that
whatever opposes those Laws, is necessarily repugnant to the Divine nature: if, therefore,
we believe that GOD may act in a manner contrary to those laws, we, in effect, believe that
He may do what is contrary to His own nature; which is absurd and impossible.'

"The reasoning turns upon the supposition that GOD is actuated by an absolute necessity of
His Nature, and not by his Will: or, rather, that He hath neither Will, nor Intellect. Otherwise,
it were easy to perceive, that in suspending the operation of His own Laws, GOD cannot be charged
with doing anything contradictory to His own nature; since He may justly be supposed to have
as good reasons for departing from those Laws, as for framing them: and as we know not why
He framed them in such a manner, and no otherwise; so He may have the best and wisest reasons
for the suspension of them, which it is not for us to call in question. To speak of the Supreme
Being as actuated by a kind of physical necessity, and not by His Will, is to confound the
GOD of Nature with Nature itself; which is the very essence of Atheism, and never can be reconciled
with any just notions of the Deity, as a Being of intellectual and moral perfections[66]."

It is by no means inconceivable, therefore, that the great Cause of Creation, and first Author
of Law should interfere at any given time in the established Order of Nature. Moreover, it
is irrational, on sufficient testimony, to disbelieve that He has sometimes so interposed.
To deny that this is conceivable, is to make GOD inferior to His own decree; to pronounce it
incredible that the Lawgiver should be superior to His own Laws. "The universal subordination
of causation," (p. 134,) we as freely admit as the Professor himself: but then we contend that
everything else must be subordinate to the First great Cause of all. Worse than unphilosophical
is it to argue as the Professor presumes to do, concerning the MOST HIGH; but unphilosophical
in the strictest sense it is. For it is to reason about Him, (the finite concerning the Infinite!)
as if we understood Him; we, who can barely decipher a little part of His works! A few more
remarks on this subject will be found in my viith Sermon.

We are anxious to know if the whole of the case is really before us. A few more extracts from
Professor Powell's Essay seem necessary to do full justice to his view of the matter:--"All
moral evidence must essentially have respect to the parties to be convinced. 'Signs' might
be adapted peculiarly to the state of moral or intellectual progress of one age, or one class
of persons, and not be suited to that of others.... And it is to the entire difference in the
ideas, prepossessions, modes, and grounds of belief in those times, that we may trace the reason
why Miracles, which would be incredible now, were not so in the age, and under the circumstances,
in which they are stated to have occurred." (p. 117.) ... "An evidential appeal which in a
long past age was convincing, as made to the state of knowledge in that age[67], might have
not only no effect, but even an injurious tendency, if urged in the present, and referring
to what is at variance with existing scientific conceptions; just as the arguments of the present
age would have been unintelligible to a former."

"In a period of advanced physical knowledge, the reference to what was believed in past times,
if at variance with principles now acknowledged, could afford little ground of appeal: in fact,
would damage the argument rather than assist it." (p. 126.)

"It becomes imperatively necessary, that such views should be suggested as may be really suitable
to better informed minds, and may meet the increasing demands of an age pretending at least
to greater enlightenment." (p. 126.)

There is nothing in the additional suggestions thus thrown out which in reality affects the
question at issue. Certain antecedent considerations were before insisted on, which (it was
said) "must be paramount to all attestation." (p. 107.) These have been disposed of. The writer
now tells us that he does not question "the honesty or veracity of the testimony, or the reality
of the impressions on the minds of the witnesses." (p. 106.) It remains to inquire therefore
to what natural causes, events which were once thought miraculous, may reasonably be referred;
since the so-called Miracles of the imperfectly-informed age of our LORD and His Apostles will
not endure the scrutiny of the present age of scientific enlightenment.

But this, unless it be a proposal to open the whole question afresh,--to examine the Miracles
themselves,--to consider them one by one,--to inquire into their exact nature,--and to investigate
their attendant circumstances,--is unmeaning. For we cannot, as reasonable men, dismiss a vast
body of august events, differing so considerably one from another, with a vague inuendo that
there was probably "some kind of mistake or deception somewhere, though we do not know where:"
(p. 106:) a hint that natural events may have been regarded as supernatural by an unscientific
age, (which I believe was Schleiermacher's view:) and so forth. The two miraculous Draughts
of fishes,--the Stater found in the fish's mouth,--the stilling of the Storm,--might perhaps,
by a little rhetorical sophistry, in unscrupulous hands, be so disposed of. But the Creative
Power displayed on the two occasions of a miraculous feeding of thousands,--the giving of sight
to a man born blind,--the calling of Lazarus out of the grave where he had been for four days
buried;--these are transactions which resist every attempt of the enemy to explain away, as
unscientific misconceptions. They may be powerless to produce conviction in some now, as they
were powerless to produce conviction in some then: but they cannot be set aside by an insinuation.
There could not have been any mistake when the Five Thousand were fed with five loaves, and
twelve baskets full were gathered up; or when the Four Thousand were fed with seven loaves,
and fragments enough to fill seven baskets remained over[68]. There was no room for deception
in the case of the man born blind; for that case immediately underwent a judicial scrutiny[69].
Lazarus bound hand and foot with grave-clothes required that the bystanders should "loose him
and let him go[70]:" but from that moment, neither supposed scientific necessity, nor antecedent
considerations, nor the ordinary course of Nature, nor any other creature, will avail to bind
him any more!

This may suffice on the subject of Professor Powell's Essay. On the great question itself,
I have said something in my Seventh Sermon, to which the reader is requested to refer.--The
performance now under consideration abounds in incorrect statements, while it revives not a
few exploded objections; but I have considered the only points in it which are material.

Thus the author assumes "that, unlike the essential Doctrines of Christianity, 'the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever,' those external accessories, [Miracles, for example,] constitute a subject
which of necessity is perpetually taking somewhat at least of a new form, with the successive
phases of opinion and knowledge." (p. 94.) But, (waiving for the moment the impossibility of
severing the Doctrines of the Gospel from the miraculous evidence that our LORD was a Teacher
sent from Heaven[71]), it requires no ability to perceive that although "opinion" should alter
daily, and "knowledge" increase ever so much, yet, events professing to be miraculous, being
plain matters of fact, are to-day exactly what and where they were many centuries ago. Physical
Science may pretend (with Paulus) to explain them on natural principles, truly; and while she
does so, the world is sure to give her a patient, even an indulgent hearing. But then she must
let it be known what she proposes to explain, and how she proposes to explain it. She must
be so indulgent also, as to listen while we, in turn, shew her on what grounds we find it impossible
to accept her Theory. "The inevitable progress of research," (says this author,) "must, within
a longer or shorter period, unravel all that seems most marvellous; and what is at present
least understood will become as familiarly known to the Science of the future, as those points
which a few centuries ago, were involved in equal obscurity, but are now thoroughly understood."
(p. 109.) Such a vaticination as regards Miracles, is, to say the least, premature; and until
it can appeal to incipient accomplishment, it must be regarded as nugatory also. I am not aware,
that as yet one single Miracle has been struck off the list; yet Miracles have now been before
the world a long time, and they have not wanted enemies either.

To begin Divinity with a discussion of the "Evidences," we do indeed hold to be a beginning
at the wrong end. At the same time, all of Professor Powell's opening remarks, in which he
insinuates that the Church would bar, or would stifle discussion concerning the evidences of
Religion, are obviously untrue. No scrutiny of Christian Miracles, however rigid, is stopped
by the admonition that such narratives "ought to be held sacred, and exempt from the unhallowed
criticism of human Reason." (p. 110.) We do not, by any means, "treat all objections as profane,
and discard exceptions unanswered as shocking and immoral." (p. 100.) Neither does the Church
think herself "omniscient and infallible;" (p. 96;) though she holds Omniscience to be an attribute
of GOD; and Infallibility, of the Bible. But she deprecates in the strongest manner vague insinuations
and unsupported doubts of the reality of her LORD'S Miracles, sown broad-cast over the land;
and she is at a loss to understand how the "difficulties" of any, can be in this manner "removed;"
(p. 96;) except by a process analogous to that which would cure a malady by taking away the
life of the patient. We are not in fact at all disposed to admit that "Miracles, which in the
estimation of a former age were among the chief supports of Christianity, are at present among
the main difficulties, and hindrances to its acceptance," (p. 140,)--although Professor Powell
and Dr. Temple say so.

This Essay in fact is full of incorrect, or objectionable statements. Thus Professor Powell
asserts that since "evidential arguments are avowedly addressed to the intellect, it is especially
preposterous to shift the ground, and charge the rejection of them on moral motives." (p. 100.)
And yet it is worthy of notice that our LORD Himself assures us that the reception of Truth
depends on our moral, rather than on our intellectual condition. "How can ye believe," (He
said to the Jews,) "which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh
from GOD only[72]?"

This writer reasons also with singular laxity and inaccuracy. After quoting the dictum that
"on a certain amount of testimony we might believe any statement, however improbable," (pp.
140-1,) he scornfully adds;--"So that if a number of respectable witnesses were to concur in
asseverating that on a certain occasion they had seen two and two make five, we should be bound
to believe them!" (p. 141.) Does he fail to perceive, (1) that mathematical truths do not come
within the province of probable reasoning, and (2) are not dependent on testimony?... Again,
"The case of the antecedent argument of Miracles is very clear, however little some are inclined
to perceive it. In Nature and from Nature, by Science and by Reason, we neither have nor can
possibly have any evidence of a Deity working by Miracles;--for that, we must go out of Nature,
and beyond Science." (pp. 141-2.) Very true. We must go to Scripture. We must have recourse
to testimony. (p. 141.) True. But this, if it is intended as an argument against the reasonableness
of admitting the truth of Miracles, is a mere petitio principii.... Again. "It is not the mere
fact but the cause or explanation of it, which is the point at issue." (p. 141.) Admitting
then, as the learned author here does, that when CHRIST said "Lazarus, come forth," "he that
was dead," (though he had been buried four days,) "came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes[73];"--admitting
these "facts," I say,--what other "cause," or "explanation" does the reverend gentleman propose
to assign but the supernatural power of the Divine Speaker?

Far graver exception, however, must be taken against certain parts of Professor Powell's labours,
which betray an animus fatally indicative of the tendency of such Essays and Reviews as these.
Witness his assertion that "it is now acknowledged that 'Creation' is only another name for
our ignorance of the mode of production;" (p. 139.)

One object of the present Essay is to insist that since Miracles belong to the world of matter,
"we must recognize the due claims of Science to decide" upon them. We are reminded that "beyond
the domain of physical causation and the possible conceptions of intellect or knowledge, there
lies open the boundless region of spiritual things, which is the sole dominion of Faith:" (p.
127:) and that "Advancing knowledge, while it asserts the dominion of Science in physical things,
confirms that of Faith in spiritual." (p. 127.) It is proposed that "we thus neither impugn
the generalizations of Philosophy, nor allow them to invade the dominion of Faith; and admit
that what is not a subject for a problem, may hold its place in a Creed." (p. 127.)

But the fatal consequences of this plausible fallacy become apparent the instant we turn the
leaf, and read that "the more knowledge advances, the more it has been, and will be acknowledged,
that Christianity, as a real religion, must be viewed apart from connexion with physical things."
(p. 128.) That "the first dissociation of the spiritual from the physical was rendered necessary
by the palpable contradictions disclosed by astronomical discovery with the letter of Scripture.
Another still wider and more material step has been effected by the discoveries of Geology.
More recently, the antiquity of the Human Race, and the development of Species, and the rejection
of the idea of 'Creation' (!) have caused new advances in the same direction." (p. 129.) ...
From this it is evident, not only that the object of Science in thus taking the Miracles of
Scripture into her own keeping, is (like an unnatural step-dame) to slay them; but that downright
Atheism is to be the attitude in which men are expected to survey that "boundless region of
spiritual things" which is yet proclaimed to be "the sole dominion of Faith!"

Faith, on the other hand, does not object to the constant visits of Science to any part of
her treasure. She does but insist that all discussion shall be conducted according to the rules
of right Reason. Vague insinuations about "a progressing Age," (p. 131,)--"new modes of speculation,"
(p. 130,)--"the advance of Opinion," (p. 131,)--and so forth, are as little to the purpose,
apart from specific objections, as sneers at "the one-sided dogmas of an obsolete school, coupled
with awful denunciations of heterodoxy on all who refuse to listen to them," (p. 131,) are
unsuited to the gravity of the occasion. Faith insists moreover that a divorce between the
miraculous parts of Scripture, and the context wherein they stand, is simply impossible. The
unbeliever who boldly says, "I disbelieve the Bible,"--however much we may deplore his blindness
and pity his misery,--is yet intelligible in his unbelief. But the man who proposes to believe
the narrative of the Exode of Israel from Egypt, (for instance,) apart from the supernatural
character of the events which are related to have attended it; who believes the history of
the Gospels, (holding the Evangelists to have been veracious writers,) yet rejects the Divine
nature of the Miracles which the Gospels relate; and proposes, after eliminating from the historical
narrative everything which claims to be miraculous, to make what remains of that historical
narrative, the strength and stay of his soul in life and in death:--that man we boldly affirm
to be one who cannot have studied the Bible with that ordinary attention which would entitle
him to dogmatize concerning its contents: or else, whose logical faculty must be so hopelessly
defective that discussions of this class are evidently not his proper province.

Finally, we are presented in this Essay with the same offensive assumption of intellectual
superiority on the part of the writer, which disfigures the entire volume. "It becomes imperatively
necessary that views should be suggested really suitable to better informed minds." (p. 126.)
"Points which may be seen to involve the greatest difficulty to more profound inquirers, are
often such as do not occasion the least perplexity to ordinary minds, but are allowed to pass
without hesitation." (p. 125.) (And this, from one of those "profound inquirers," one of "those
who have reflected most deeply," (p. 126,) who yet cannot get beyond a resuscitation of Hume
and Spinoza's exploded objections to the truth of Miracles!)--Butler's unanswerable arguments,
(for the allusion is evidently to him,) are spoken of as "a few trite and commonplace generalities
as to the moral government of the World and the belief in the Divine Omnipotence; or as to
the validity of human testimony; or the limits of human experience." (p. 133.) And yet the
author is for ever informing us that his hostility to Miracles "is essentially built upon those
grander conceptions of the order of Nature, those comprehensive primary elements of all physical
knowledge, those ultimate ideas of universal causation, which can only be familiar to those
thoroughly versed in cosmical philosophy in its widest sense." (p. 133.) "All highly cultivated
minds, and duly advanced intellects," are supposed to find their exponent in Professor Baden
Powell. All other thinkers have "minds of a less comprehensive capacity," "accustomed to reason
on more contracted views." (p. 133. See also p. 131, top.) Is this the modesty of real Science?
the language of a true Philosopher and Divine?

Finally, after all that has gone before we are not much astonished, but we are considerably
shocked, to read as follows:--"The Divine Omnipotence is entirely an inference from the language
of the Bible, adopted on the assumption of a belief in Revelation. That 'with GOD nothing is
impossible' is the very declaration of Scripture; yet on this, the whole belief in Miracles
is built[74]." Now, it happens that 'the whole belief in Miracles' is built on nothing of the
kind: but the point is immaterial. By no means immaterial, however, is the intimation that
the Divine attribute of Omnipotence is a mere inference from the language of Revelation,--the
very belief in which is also a mere "assumption." If belief in Holy Scripture is to be treated
as an assumption,--without at all complaining of the unreasonableness of one who so speaks,--we
yet desire that he would say it very plainly; and let us know at least with whom we have to
do, and what we are expected to prove. We do not complain, if any one calls upon us to shew
that a belief in the Bible cannot be called an assumption; but it makes us very sad: and when
the challenge comes from a Minister of the Church, we are unable to forbear the remark that
there is something altogether immoral[75] in the entire proceeding. On the other hand, to find
ourselves involved in an argument on questions of Divinity with one who believes nothing, is
in a manner absurd; and provokes a feeling of resentment as well as of pity.... What need to
add that life is not long enough for such processes of proof? "He that cometh unto GOD must
believe that He is!" We cannot be for ever laying the foundation. The building must begin,
at last, to grow. And when it has grown up, and is compact as well as beautiful, it cannot
be necessary to pull it all down again once or twice in every century in order to ascertain
whether the strong foundations be still there!

       *       *       *       *       *

IV. The next performance is mainly directed against faith in the Church, as a society of Divine
origin. "The Rev. HENRY BRISTOW WILSON, B.D., Vicar of Great Staughton, Hunts," claims that
a National Church shall be regarded as a purely secular Institution,--the spontaneous development
of the State. "If all priests and ministers of religion could at one moment be swept from the
face of the Earth, they would soon be reproduced[76]." The Church is concerned with Ethics,
not with Divinity. It should therefore be "free from dogmatic tests, and similar intellectual
bondage:" (p. 168:) hampered by no traditional Doctrines; pledged to no Creeds: but, on the
contrary, should be subject to periodical doctrinal re-adjustments. "Doctrinal limitations"
(i.e. the Creeds) "are not essential to" the Church. "Upon larger knowledge of Christian history,
upon a more thorough acquaintance with the mental constitution of man, upon an understanding
of the obstacles they present to a true Catholicity (!), they may be cast off." (p. 167.) "In
order to the possibility of recruiting any national Ministry from the whole of the nation,
... no needless intellectual or speculative obstacles should be interposed." (p. 196. So at
p. 198.)

To all this, the answer is very obvious. Viewed as an historical fact, the Church is not of
human origin. The Church is a Divine Institution. That a Priest of the Church, charged with
a cure of souls, should desire her annihilation,--the reversal of the facts of her past History,--her
reconstruction on an unheard-of basis, without even Creeds as terms of communion with her,--and
so forth; all this may suggest some very painful doubts as to the objector's honesty in continuing
to employ the formularies of that Church, and in professing to teach her doctrines;--but it
can hardly be supposed to have any effect whatever on the question at issue.

Foreseeing this, Mr. Wilson begins by asserting,--(for to insinuate is not for so advanced
a disciple of "the negative Theology,") (p. 151,)--"the fact of a very wide-spread alienation,
both of educated and uneducated persons, from the Christianity which is ordinarily presented
in our Churches and Chapels." (p. 150.) "A self-satisfied Sacerdotalism, confident in a supernaturally
transmitted illumination," may amuse itself in trying to "keep peace within the walls of emptied
Churches:" (p. 150:) but the day for "traditional Christianity" (p. 149.) has gone by. We may
no longer ignore "a great extent of dissatisfaction on the part of the Clergy at some portion,
at least, of formularies of the Church of England,"--especially at the use of "one unhappy
creed." (p. 150.) There has been "a spontaneous recoil" from some of the old doctrines: a distrust
of the old arguments: and a misgiving concerning Scripture itself. "In the presence of difficulties
of this kind, ... it is vain to seek to check open discussion." (p. 151.)

Why then does not this man proceed openly to discuss? is the obvious rejoinder. Instead of
vaguely hinting that either the Reason or the Moral sense is shocked by what people hear "in
our Churches and Chapels,"--why has not this writer, first, the honesty to withdraw from the
Ministry of the Church of England; and next, the courage to indicate the particular doctrines
which offend? To say that "the ordinances of public worship and religious instruction provided
for the people of England" are not "really adapted to the wants of their nature as it is,"
(p. 150,) is a very vague and unworthy style of urging an objection. Why does not the reverend
writer explain wherein the Doctrine and Discipline of the English Church are not really adapted
to the actual wants of Man's nature?

Let every unbeliever however be allowed to state his difficulties in his own way. Mr. Wilson's
difficulties certainly take a very peculiar shape. The increased Geographical knowledge of
the present generation has evidently disturbed his faith. "In our own boyhood, the World as
known to the ancients was nearly all which was known to ourselves (!). We have recently become
acquainted,--intimate,--with the teeming regions of the far East, and with empires, pagan or
even atheistic, of which the origin runs far back beyond the historic records of Judæa or of
the West, and which were more populous than all Christendom now is, for many ages before the
Christian era." (p. 162.) Such a statement is soon made; but it ought to have been substantiated.
I take the liberty of doubting its accuracy.

But granting even that the heathen world "for many ages before the Christian era" was more
populous than all Christendom now is:--what then? This fact "suggests questions to those who
on Sundays hear the reading and exposition of the Scriptures as they were expounded to our
forefathers, and on Monday peruse the news of a World of which our forefathers little dreamed."
(pp. 152-3.)--And pray, (we calmly inquire,) Why are the Scriptures to be read or expounded
after a novel fashion, even though our geographical knowledge has made a considerable advance?
To this, we are favoured with no answer. The "questions" suggested are, we presume, the same
which are contained in the following sentence. "In what relation does the Gospel stand to these
millions[77]? Is there any trace on the face of its records that it even contemplated their
existence[78]? We are told, that to know and believe in JESUS CHRIST is in some sense necessary
to Salvation. It has not been given to these. Are they,--will they be, hereafter,--the worse
off for their ignorance?" (p. 153.) ... "As to the necessity of faith in a SAVIOUR to these
peoples when they could never have had it, no one, upon reflection, can believe in any such
thing. Doubtless they will be equitably dealt with." (p. 153.)

These last seven words, (which scarcely seem of a piece with the rest of the sentence,) we
confess have always seemed a sufficient answer to the badly-expressed speculative difficulty
which immediately precedes; a difficulty, be it observed, which does not depend at all on the
popular advancement of Geographical knowledge; for it was urged with the self-same force anciently,
as now; and was met by Bp. Butler, almost in the self-same words[79], upwards of a hundred
years ago. But Mr. Wilson to our surprise and sorrow proceeds:--"We cannot be content to wrap
this question up and leave it for a mystery, as to what shall become of those myriads upon
myriads of non-Christian races. First, if our traditions tell us, that they are involved in
the curse and perdition of Adam, and may justly be punished hereafter individually for his
transgression, not having been extricated from it by saving faith,--we are disposed to think
that our traditions cannot herein fairly declare to us the words and inferences from Scripture;
but if on examination it should turn out that they have,--we must say, that the authors of
the Scriptural books have, in those matters, represented to us their own inadequate conceptions,
and not the mind of the SPIRIT of GOD." (pp. 153-4.)

I forbear to dwell upon the grievous spectacle with which we are thus presented. Here is a
Clergyman of the Church of England deliberately proposing the following dilemma:--Either the
Prayer Book is incorrect in its most important doctrinal inferences from Holy Scripture; or
else, the Authors of Holy Scripture itself are incorrect in their statements. The morality
of one who declares that he finds himself placed between the horns of this dilemma, and yet
retains his office as a public teacher in the Church of England,--it is painful to contemplate.
But this is only ad hominem. The Reverend writer's difficulty remains.

And it seems sufficient to reply:--It is not we who "wrap up the question," but GOD. As a mystery
we find it; and as a mystery, we not only "can," but must be content to "leave it." Scripture,
on the other hand, as unequivocally assures us that GOD is good, or rather that He is very
Goodness. We are convinced, (in Mr. Wilson's words,) "that all shall be equitably dealt with
according to their opportunities." (p. 154.) Moreover, he would be a rash Divine who should
venture to adopt the opinion so strenuously disclaimed by Bp. Butler, "that none can have the
benefit of the general Redemption, but such as have the advantage of being made acquainted
with it in the present life[83]." Equally unable am I also to understand how the discovery
that a larger number of persons are the subjects of this speculative difficulty than used once
to be supposed, can constitute any reason why Scripture should not still be read and expounded
on Sunday "as it used to be expounded to our forefathers."

We have been so particular, because whenever any of these writers condescend to be argumentative,
we are eager to bear them company. No wish at all have we, in the abstract, to stifle inquiry;
no objection whatever have we to the principle of free discussion. And yet, as a clergyman,
I cannot discuss such questions as these with a Minister of the Church of England, except under
protest. I deny that these are in any sense open questions. To dispute concerning them,--εἰ
μὴ θέσιν διαφυλάττων,--one of the disputants must first, at least, resign his commission. It
is simply dishonest in a man to hold a commission in the Church of England, under solemn vows,
and yet to deny her doctrines. An Officer in the Army who should pursue a similar line of action,
would be dismissed the Service,--or worse.--Under protest, then, we follow the Rev. H. B. Wilson,
B.D.

Next come three other specimens "of the modern questionings of traditional Christianity," "whereby
observers are rendered dissatisfied with old modes of speaking:" (p. 156:) viz. (1) St. Paul
"speaks of the Gospel 'which was preached to every nation (sic) under heaven,' when it has
never yet been preached to the half[84]." (2) "Then, again, it has often been appealed to as
an evidence of the supernatural origin of Christianity, and as an instance of supernatural
assistance vouchsafed to it in the first centuries, that it so soon overspread the world:"
(p. 155:) whereas "it requires no learning to be aware that neither then nor subsequently have
the Christians amounted to a fourth part of the people of the Earth." (Ibid.) (3) So again,
"it has been customary to argue that, à priori, a supernatural Revelation was to be expected
at the time when JESUS CHRIST was manifested upon the Earth, by reason of the exhaustion of
all natural or unassisted human efforts for the amelioration of mankind;" (pp. 155-6;) whereas
"our recently enlarged Ethnographical information shews such an argument to be altogether inapplicable
to the case." "It would be more like the realities of things, as we can now behold them, to
say that the Christian Revelation was given to the Western World, because it deserved it better
and was more prepared for it than the East." (p. 156.)--The remedy for the first of these difficulties
(says Mr. Wilson,) is, "candidly to acknowledge that the words of the New Testament which speak
of the preaching of the Gospel to the whole world, were limited to the understanding of the
times when they were spoken." The suggestions of our own moral instincts are rather to be followed,
"than the express declarations of Scripture writers, who had no such knowledge as is given
to ourselves of the amplitude of the World." (p. 157.)

For my own part, I see not how Mr. Wilson's proposed remedy meets the case; unless he means
to say that in the time of St. Paul the Gospel had been literally preached to the whole World
as far as the World was then known. If not, it is clear that recourse must be had to some other
expedient. Instead then of the "candid acknowledgment" required of us by the learned writer,
may we be allowed to suggest to him the more prosaic expedient (1st) of making sure that he
quotes Scripture accurately; and (2nd) that he understands it?... It happens that St. Paul
does not use the words "every nation under heaven" as Mr. Wilson inadvertently supposes. The
Apostle's phrase, πάσῃ τῇ κτίσει, in Colossians i. 23, (as in St. Mark xvi. 15), means 'to
the whole Creation,' or 'every creature;' (the article is doubtful;) in other words, he announces
the universality of the Gospel, as contrasted with the Law; and he explains that it had been
preached to the Heathen as well as to the Jews. Our increased knowledge therefore has nothing
whatever to do with the question; and the supposed difficulty disappears. The two which remain,
being (according to the same writer,) merely incorrect inferences of Biblical critics, need
not, it is presumed, be regarded as insurmountable either.

Following Mr. Wilson through his successive vagaries of religious (?) thought, we come upon
a succession of strange statements; the object of which seems to be to cast a slur on Doctrine
generally.--The doctrine of Justification by faith "is not met with ... in the Apostolic writings,
except those of St. Paul." (p. 160.) [A minute exception truly!].--"Then, on the other hand,
it is maintained by a large body of Theologians, as by the learned Jesuit Petavius and many
others, that the doctrine afterwards developed into the Nicene and Athanasian, is not to be
found explicitly in the earliest fathers, nor even in Scripture, although provable by it."
(p. 160.) [Would it not have been fair, however, to state what appears to have been the design
of Petavius therein[85]? and should it not have been added that our own Bishop Bull in his
immortal "Defensio Fidei Nicænæ" established the very reverse "out of the writings of the Catholic
Doctors who flourished within the first three centuries of the Christian Church[86]?"] "The
nearer we come to the original sources of the History, the less definite do we find the statements
of Doctrines, and even of the facts from which the Doctrines were afterwards inferred." (p.
160.) "In the patristic writings, theoretics assume continually an increasingly disproportionate
value. Even within the compass of our New Testament, there is to be found already a wonderful
contrast between the words of our LORD and such a discourse as the Epistle to the Hebrews."
(pp. 160-1.) [What a curious discovery, by the way, that an argumentative Epistle should differ
in style from an historical Gospel!] "Our LORD'S Discourses," (continues this writer,) "have
almost all of them a direct Moral bearing." (p. 161.) [The case of St. John's Gospel immediately
recurs to our memory. And it seems to have occurred to Mr. Wilson's also. He says:--] "This
character of His words is certainly more obvious in the first three Gospels than in the fourth;
and the remarkable unison of those Gospels, when they recite the LORD'S words, notwithstanding
their discrepancies in some matters of fact, compels us to think, that they embody more exact
traditions of what He actually said than the fourth does." (p. 161.) [In other words, the authenticity
of St. John's Gospel[87] is to be suspected rather than the worthlessness of the speculations
of the Vicar of Great Staughton!]

The object of three pages which follow (pp. 162-5.) seems to be to shew that in the Apostolic
Age, Immorality of life was more severely dealt with, even than erroneousness of Doctrine.
Except because the writer is eager to depreciate the value of orthodoxy of belief, and to cast
a slur on doctrinal standards generally,--it is hard to see why he should write thus. Let him
be reminded however that our SAVIOUR makes Faith itself a moral, not an intellectual habit[88];
and, (if it be not an uncivil remark,) what but an immoral spectacle does a Clergyman present
who openly inculcates distrust of these very Doctrines which he has in the most solemn manner
pledged himself to uphold and maintain?

And thus we come back to the theme originally proposed. "A national Church," we are informed,
"need not, historically speaking, be Christian (!); nor, if it be Christian, need it be tied
down to particular forms which have been prevalent at certain times in Christendom (!). That
which is essential to a National Church is, that it should undertake to assist the spiritual
progress of the nation and of the individuals of which it is composed, in their several states
and stages. Not even a Christian Church should expect all those who are brought under its influence
to be, as a matter of fact, of one and the same standard; but should endeavour to raise each
according to his capacities, and should give no occasion for a reaction against itself, nor
provoke the individualist element into separation." (p. 173.) Of what sort the Ministers of
such a "chartered libertine" are to prove, may be anticipated. "Thought and speech, which are
free among all other classes," must be free also "among those who hold the office of leaders
and teachers of the rest in the highest things." The Ministers of the Church ought not "to
be bound to cover up, but to open; and having, it is presumed, possession of the key of knowledge,
ought not to stand at the door with it, permitting no one to enter unless by force. A National
Church may also find itself in this position, which, perhaps, is our own." (p. 174.)--What
a charming picture of the duties and the method of that class to which the Vicar of Great Staughton
himself belongs!... The writer proceeds to set an example of that freedom of inquiry which
he vindicates as the privilege of his Order; and without which he is apprehensive of being
left isolated between "the fanatical religionist," (p. 174,) (i.e. the man who believes the
truths he teaches,) and "the negative theologian," (i.e. those who, "impatient of old fetters,
follow free thought heedlessly wherever it may lead them.") (Ibid.) "The freedom of opinion[89],"
(he says,) "which belongs to the English citizen should be conceded to the English Churchman;
and the freedom which is already practically enjoyed by the members of the congregation, cannot
without injustice be denied to its ministers." (p. 180.) Let us see how the Reverend Gentleman
exercises the license which he claims:--

The phrase "Word of GOD," (he says,) is unauthorized and begs the question. The epithet "Canonical"
"may mean either books ruled and determined by the Church, or regulation books; and the employment
of it in the Article hesitates between these two significations." (p. 176.) The declaration
of the sixth Article simply implies "the Word of GOD is contained in Scripture; whence it does
not follow that it is co-extensive with it." (p. 170.) "Under the terms of the Sixth Article
one may accept literally, or allegorically, or as parable, or poetry, or legend, the story
of a serpent-tempter, of an ass speaking with man's voice, of an arresting the earth's motion,
of a reversal of its motion[90], of waters standing in a solid heap, of witches, and a variety
of apparitions. So under the terms of the Sixth Article, every one is free in judgment as to
the primeval institution of the Sabbath, the universality of the Deluge, the confusion of tongues,
the corporeal taking up of Elijah into Heaven, the nature of Angels, the reality of demoniacal
possession, the personality of Satan, and the miraculous particulars of many events." (p. 177.)
"Good men," we are assured; (the Inspired Writers being the good men intended;) "may err in
facts, be weak in memory, mingle imaginations with memory, be feeble in inferences, confound
illustration with argument, be varying in judgment and opinion." (p. 179.) [A "free handling"
this, of the work of the HOLY GHOST, truly!... It would, I suppose, be deemed very unreasonable
to wish that a catalogue of facts misstated,--of slips of memory,--of imaginary details,--of
feeble inferences,--of instances of logical confusion,--and so forth, had been subjoined by
the Reverend writer. I will only observe concerning his method that such "frank criticism of
Scripture" (p. 174.) as this, is dogmatism of the most disreputable kind: insinuating what
it does not state; assuming what it ought to prove; asserting in the general what it may be
defied to substantiate in particular.] It follows,--"But the spirit of absolute Truth cannot
err or contradict Himself; if He speak immediately, even in small things, accessories, or accidents."
(p. 179.) To this we entirely agree. Where then are the "errors?" and where the "contradictions?"

We cannot "suppose Him to suggest contradictory accounts:" [not contradictory, of course; because
contradictories cannot both be true:] "or accounts only to be reconciled in the way of hypothesis
and conjecture."--(Ibid.) Why not[91]?

"To suppose a supernatural influence to cause the record of that which can only issue in a
puzzle, is to lower indefinitely our conception of the Divine dealings in respect of a special
Revelation." (Ibid.)--Why more of a lowering puzzle in GOD'S Word than in GOD'S Works[92]?

Mr. Wilson proceeds:--"It may be attributed to the defect of our understandings, that we should
be unable altogether to reconcile the aspects of the SAVIOUR as presented to us in the first
three Gospels, and in the writings of St. Paul and St. John. At any rate, there were current
in the primitive Church very distinct Christologies."--(Ibid.) Queer language this for a plain
man! I, for my own part, have never yet discovered the difficulty which is here hinted at;
but which has been prudently left unexplained. The last part of the sentence discovers nothing
so much as the writer's ignorance of the subject on which he presumes to dogmatize.

Presently, we read,--"It may be worth while to consider how far a liberty of opinion is conceded
by our existing Laws, Civil and Ecclesiastical."--(p. 180.) "As far as opinion privately entertained
is concerned, the liberty of the English Clergyman appears already to be complete. For no Ecclesiastical
person can be obliged to answer interrogations as to his opinions; nor be troubled for that
which he has not actually expressed; nor be made responsible for inferences which other people
may draw from his expressions." (Ibid.)--Surely such language needs only to be cited to awaken
indignation in every honest bosom! "With most men educated, not in the schools of Jesuitism,
but in the sound and honest moral training of an English Education, the mere entering on the
record such a plea as this, must destroy the whole case. If the position of the religious instructor
is to be maintained only by his holding one thing as true, and teaching another thing as to
be received,--in the name of the GOD of Truth, either let all teaching cease, or let the fraudulent
instructor abdicate willingly his office, before the moral indignation of an as yet uncorrupted
people thrust him ignominiously from his abused seat[93]!"

The remarks just quoted serve to introduce a series of views on subscription to the Articles,
which, if they were presented to me without any intimation of the quarter from which they proceed,
I should not have hesitated to denounce as simply dishonest[94].... The Statute 13 Eliz. c.
12, is next discussed with the same unhappy licentiousness; and the declaration that "the meshes
are too open for modern refinements." (p. 185.) ... I desire not to speak with undue severity
of a fellow-creature: but I protest that I cannot read the Review under consideration without
a profound conviction that, (speaking for myself,) I have to do with one whom in the common
concerns of life I would not trust. The aptitude here displayed[95] for playing tricks with
plain language, is calculated to sap the foundations of human intercourse, and to destroy confidence.
If plain words may mean anything, or may mean nothing,--then, farewell to all good faith in
the intercourse of daily life. If Articles "for the avoiding of Diversities of Opinions, and
for the establishing of Consent touching true Religion[96],"--such Articles especially as the
IInd., "Of the WORD or SON of GOD, which was made very Man;" and the Vth., "Of the HOLY GHOST,"
(which the Rev. Mr. Wilson calls "humanifying of the Divine Word," and "the Divine Personalities,")
(p. 186,)--may be signed by one who, even in signing, resolves to "pass by the side of them,"
(p. 186, line 6,)--then is it better at once to admit that no Logic can be supposed to be available
with such a writer; that he places himself outside the reach of fair argumentation; and must
not be astonished if he shall find himself regarded by his peers simply in the light of an
untrustworthy and impracticable person.

The last stage of all in this deplorable paper is an application to Holy Scripture itself of
the tricks which the Vicar of Great Staughton has already played, so much to his own satisfaction,
with the Articles. "We may say that the value of the historical parts of the Bible may consist,
rather in their significance, in the ideas which they awaken, than in the scenes themselves
which they depict." (p. 199.) To a plain English understanding, (unperplexed with the dreams
of Strauss, and other unbelievers of the same stamp,) such a statement conveys scarcely an
intelligible notion. But we are not left long in doubt.

"The application of Ideology to the interpretation of Scripture, to the doctrines of Christianity,
to the formularies of the Church, may undoubtedly be carried to an excess; may be pushed so
far as to leave in the sacred records no historical residue whatever.... An example of the
critical Ideology carried to excess, is that of Strauss; which resolves into an ideal the whole
of the historical and doctrinal person of JESUS.... But it by no means follows, because Strauss
has substituted a mere shadow for the JESUS of the Evangelists, that there are not traits in
the scriptural person of Jesus, which are better explained by referring them to an ideal than
an historical origin: and without falling into fanciful exegetics, there are parts of Scripture
more usefully interpreted ideologically than in any other manner,--as for instance, the history
of the Temptation of JESUS by Satan, and accounts of demoniacal possessions." (pp. 200-201.)
"Some may consider the descent of all Mankind from Adam and Eve as an undoubted historical
fact; others may rather perceive in that relation a form of narrative into which in early ages
tradition would easily throw itself spontaneously.... Among a particular people, this historical
representation became the concrete expression of a great moral truth,--of the brotherhood of
all human beings.... The force, grandeur, and reality of these ideas are not a whit impaired
in the abstract, nor indeed the truth of the concrete history (!) as their representation,
even though mankind should have been placed upon the earth in many pairs at once, or in distinct
centres of creation. For the brotherhood of men really depends," &c., &c. (p. 201.) "Let us
suppose one to be uncertain whether our LORD were born of the house and lineage of David, or
of the tribe of Levi; and even to be driven to conclude that the genealogies of Him have little
historic value; nevertheless, in idea, JESUS is both Son of David and Son of Aaron, both Prince
of Peace, and High Priest of our profession; as He is, under another idea, though not literally,
'without father and without mother.' And He is none the less Son of David, Priest Aaronical,
or Royal Priest Melchizedecan, in idea and spiritually, even if it be unproved whether He were
any of them in historic fact.--In like manner it need not trouble us, if in consistency, we
should have to suppose both an ideal origin, and to apply an ideal meaning, to the birth in
the city of David, (!) and to other circumstances of the Infancy. (!) So again, the Incarnification
of the divine Immanuel remains, although the angelic appearances which herald it in the narratives
of the Evangelists may be of ideal origin, according to the conceptions of former days." (pp.
202-3.) "And," lastly,--"liberty must be left to all as to the extent in which they apply this
principle!" (p. 201.)

To such dreamy nonsense, what "Answer" can we return[97]? Such speculations would be a fair
subject for ridicule and merriment, if the subject were not so unspeakably solemn,--the issues
so vast, and terribly momentous. We find ourselves introduced into a new world,--of which the
denizens talk like madmen, and in a jargon of their own. And yet, that jargon is no sooner
understood, than the true character of our new companions becomes painfully evident[98]....
He who believes the plain words of Holy Writ, finds himself called "the literalist." He who
resolves Scripture into a dream, and the LORD who redeemed him into "a mere shadow," (p. 200)
is dignified with the title of "an idealist." "Neither" (we are assured) "should condemn the
other. They are fed with the same truths; the literalist unconsciously, the idealist with reflection.
Neither can justly say of the other that he undervalues the Sacred Writings, or that he holds
them as inspired less properly than himself." (p. 200.) "The ideologian," (who is the same
person as the "idealist;" for the gentleman, at this place, changes his name;) "is evidently
in possession of a principle which will enable him to stand in charitable relation to persons
of very different opinions from his own." (Ibid.) ... I will but modestly inquire,--What would
be said of us, if we were so to expound Holy Scripture in defence of Christianity?

But it is time to dismiss this tissue of worthless as well as most mischievous writing;--even
to exhibit which, in the words of its misguided author, ought to be its own sufficient exposure.
Do men really expect us to "answer" such groundless assertions, and vague speculations as those
which go before? A Faith without Creeds: a Clergy without authority or fixed opinions: a Bible
without historical truth:--how can such things, for a moment, be supposed to be[99]? What answer
do we render to the sick man who sees unsubstantial goblins on the solid tapestried wall; and
mistakes for shadowy apparitions of the night, the forms of flesh and blood which are ministering
to his life's necessities? If the Temptation, and the Transfiguration, and the Miracles of
CHRIST be not true history, but ideological allegories,--then why not His Nativity and His
Crucifixion,--His Death and His Burial,--His Resurrection and His Ascension into Heaven likewise?
"Liberty" (we have been expressly told,) "must be left to all, as to the extent in which they
apply the principle" (p. 201.)--Where then is Ideology to begin,--or rather, where is ideology
to end? "Why then is Strauss to be blamed for using that universal liberty, and 'resolving
into an ideal the whole of the historical and doctrinal person of JESUS?' Why is Strauss' resolution
'an excess?' or where and by what authority, short of his extreme view, would Mr. Wilson himself
stop? or at what point of the process? and by what right could he, consistently with his own
canon, call on any other speculator, to stay the ideologizing process[100]?"

"Discrepancies in narratives, scientific difficulties, defects in evidence, do not disturb
the ideologist as they do the literalist." (p. 203.) No, truly. Nothing troubles him; simply
because he believes nothing! The very Sacraments of the Gospel are not secure from his unhallowed
touch. "The same principle" (?) is declared to be "capable of application" to them also. "Within
these concrete conceptions there lie hid the truer ideas of the virtual presence of the LORD
JESUS everywhere that He is preached, remembered, and represented." (p. 204.) ... Do we ever
deal thus with any other book of History? And yet, on what possible principle is the Bible
to be thus trifled with, and Thucydides to be spared?--I protest, if the historical personages
of either Testament may be resolved at will into abstract qualities, and the historical transactions
of either Testament may be supposed to represent ideas and notions only,--then, I see not why
the Vicar of Great Staughton himself may not prove to be a mythical personage also. Why need
Henry Bristow Wilson, B.D.,--who, (as "literalists" say,) in 1841 was one of the 'Four Tutors'
who procured the condemnation of Tract No. 90, on the ground that it 'evaded rather than explained
the Thirty-nine Articles;' and who, in 1861 writes that "Subscription to the Articles may be
thought even inoperative upon the conscience by reason of its vagueness;" (p. 181.)--why need
this author be supposed to be a man at all? Why should he not be interpreted "ideologically;"
and resolved into the principle of disgraceful Inconsistency of conduct, and "variation of
opinion at different periods of life?"

V. In the present crusade against the Bible and the Faith of Christian men, the task of destroying
confidence in the first chapter of Genesis has been undertaken by MR. C. W. GOODWIN, M.A. He
requires us to "regard it as the speculation of some Hebrew Descartes or Newton, promulgated
in all good faith as the best and most probable account that could be then given of GOD'S Universe."
(p. 252.)

Mr. Goodwin remarks with scorn, that "we are asked to believe that a vision of Creation was
presented to him by Divine power, for the purpose of enabling him to inform the world of what
he had seen; which vision inevitably led him to give a description which has misled the world
for centuries, and in which the truth can now only with difficulty be recognized." (p. 247.)
He puts "pen to paper," therefore, (he says,) in order to induce the world to a "frank recognition
of the erroneous views of nature which the Bible contains." (p. 211.) The importance of the
inquiry, he vindicates in the following modest terms:--"Physical Science goes on unconcernedly
pursuing its own paths. Theology, (the Science whose object is the dealing of GOD with Man
as a moral being,) maintains but a shivering existence, shouldered and jostled by the sturdy
growths of modern thought, and bemoaning itself for the hostility it encounters." (p. 211.)--A
few remarks at once suggest themselves.

I cannot help thinking that if any person of ordinary intelligence, unacquainted with the Bible,
were to be left to obtain his notion of its contents from "Essays and Reviews," infidel publications
generally, and (absit invidia verbo!) from not a few of the Sermons which have been preached
and printed in either University of late years,--the notion so obtained would be singularly
at variance with the known facts of the case. Would not a man infallibly carry away an impression
that the Bible is a book abounding in statements concerning matters of Physical Science which
are flatly contradicted by the ascertained phenomena of Nature? Would he not be led to expect
that it contained every here and there a theoretical Excursus on certain Astronomical or Physiological
subjects? and to anticipate, above all, an occasional chapter on Geology? Great would be his
astonishment, surely, at finding that one single chapter comprises nearly the whole of the
statements which modern philosophy finds so very hateful; and that chapter, the first chapter
in the Bible[101].

But the surprise would grow considerably when the conditions of the problem came to be a little
more fully stated. Has then the actual history of the World's Creation been ascertained from
some other independent and infallible source? No! Are Geologists as yet so much as agreed even
about a theory of the Creation? No! Can it be proved that any part of the Mosaic account is
false? Certainly not! Then why all this hostile dogmatism?--To witness the violence of the
partisans of Geological discovery, and the arrogance of their pretensions, one would suppose
that some Divine Creed of theirs had been impugned: that a revelation had been made to them
from Heaven, which the profane and unbelieving world was reluctant to accept. Whereas, these
are Christian men, impatient, as it seems, to tear the first leaf out of their Bible: or rather,
to throw discredit on the entire volume, by establishing the untrustworthiness of the earliest
page!

One single additional consideration completes the strangeness of the picture. If our account
of the Six Days of Creation were a sybilline leaf of unknown origin, it would not be unreasonable
to treat its revelations as little worth. But since the author of it is confessedly Moses,--the
great Hebrew prophet, who lived from B.C. 1571 to 1451, who enjoyed the vision of the Most
High; nay, who conversed with GOD face to face, was with Him in the Mount for thrice forty
days, and received from Him the whole details of the Sacred Law;--since this first chapter
of Genesis is known to have formed a part of the Church's unbroken heritage from that time
onward, and therefore must be acknowledged to be an integral part of the volume of Scripture
which, (as our LORD says,) οὐ δύναται λυθῆναι,--"cannot be broken, diluted, loosened, explained
away;"--since, further, this account of Creation is observed to occur in the most conspicuous
place of the most conspicuous of those books which are designated by an Apostle by the epithet
θέοπνευστος, or, "given by inspiration," "filled with the breath," or "Spirit of GOD;" and
when it is considered that our SAVIOUR and His Apostles refer to the primæval history contained
in the first two chapters about thirty times[102]:--when, (I say,) all this is duly weighed,
surely too strong a primâ facie case has been made out on behalf of the first chapter of Genesis,
that its authority should be imperilled by the random statements of every fresh individual
who sees fit to master the elements of Geology; and on the strength of that qualification presumes
to sit in judgment on the Hebrew Scriptures,--of which, confessedly, he does not understand
so much as the alphabet!

It is even amusing to see how vain a little mind can become of a little knowledge. Mr. Goodwin
remarks,--"The school-books of the present day, while they teach the child that the Earth moves,
yet assure him that it is a little less than six thousand years old, and that it was made in
six days." (p. 210.) (I am puzzled to reconcile this statement with the author's declaration
that "no well-instructed person now doubts the great antiquity of the Earth any more than its
motion." (Ibid.) Would it not have been fairer to have named at least one of the school-books
which perpetuate so wicked a heresy?) "On the other hand, Geologists of all religious creeds
are agreed that the Earth has existed for an immense series of years,--to be counted by millions
rather than by thousands; and that indubitably more than six days elapsed from its first Creation
to the appearance of Man upon its surface. By this broad discrepancy between old and new doctrine
is the modern mind startled, as were the men of the sixteenth century when told that the earth
moved." (p. 210.)

But begging pardon of our philosopher, if all he means is that more than six days elapsed between
the Creation of "Heaven and Earth," (noticed in ver. 1,) and the Creation of Man, (spoke of
from ver. 26 to 28,)--he means to say mighty little; and need not fear to encounter contradiction
from any "well-instructed person." True, that an ignorant man could not have suspected anything
of the kind from reading the first chapter of Genesis: but this is surely nobody's fault but
his own. An ignorant man might in like manner be of opinion that the Sun and Moon are the two
largest objects in creation; and there is not a word in this same chapter calculated to undeceive
him. Again, he might think that the Sun rises and sets; and the common language of the Observatory
would confirm him hopelessly in his mistake. All this however is no one's fault but his own.
The ancient Fathers of the Church, behind-hand as they were in Physical Science, yet knew enough
to anticipate "the hypothesis of the Geologist; and two of the Christian Fathers, Augustine
and Theodoret, are referred to as having actually held that a wide interval elapsed between
the first act of Creation, mentioned in the Mosaic account, and the commencement of the Six
Days' work." (p. 231.) Mr. Goodwin therefore has got no further, so far, than Augustine and
Theodoret got, 1400 years since, without the aid of Geology.

But we must hasten on. The business of the Essayist, as we have said, is to undermine our confidence
in the Bible, by exposing the ignorance of the author of the first chapter. "Modern theologians,"
(he remarks, with unaffected displeasure,) "have directed their attention to the possibility
of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with those geological facts which are admitted to be beyond
dispute." (p. 210.)--And pray, (we modestly ask,) is not such a proceeding obvious? A "frank
recognition of the erroneous views of Nature which the Bible contains," (p. 211,) we shall
be prepared to yield when those "erroneous views" have been demonstrated to exist,--but not
till then. Mr. Goodwin must really remember that although, in his opinion, the "Mosaic Cosmogony,"
(for so he phrases it,) is "not an authentic utterance of Divine knowledge, but a human utterance,"
(p. 253,) the World thinks differently. The learned and wise and good of all ages, including
the present, are happily agreed that the first chapter of Genesis is part of the Word of GOD.

After what is evidently intended to be a showy sketch of the past history of our planet,--"we
pass" (says Mr. Goodwin) "to the account of the Creation contained in the Hebrew record. And
it must be observed that in reality two distinct accounts are given us in the book of Genesis;
one, being comprised in the first chapter and the first three verses of the second; the other,
commencing at the fourth verse of the second chapter and continuing till the end. This is so
philologically certain that it were useless to ignore it." (p. 217.) Really we read such statements
with a kind of astonishment which almost swallows up sorrow. Do they arise, (to quote Mr. Goodwin's
own language,) "from our modern habits of thought, and from the modesty of assertion which
the spirit of true science has taught us?" (p. 252.) Convinced that my unsupported denial would
have no more weight than Mr. Goodwin's ought to have, I have referred the dictum just quoted
to the highest Hebrew authority available, and have been assured that it is utterly without
foundation.

After such experience of Mr. Goodwin's philological "certainties," what amount of attention
does he expect his dicta to command in a Science which, starting from "a region of uncertainty,
where Philosophy is reduced to mere guesses and possibilities, and pronounces nothing definite,"
(p. 213,) has to travel through "a prolonged period, beginning and ending we know not when;"
(p. 214;) reaches another period, "the duration of which no one presumes to define;" (Ibid.;)
and again another, during which "nothing can be asserted positively:" (p. 215:) after which
comes "a kind of artificial break?" (Ibid.)

For my own part, I freely confess that Mr. Goodwin's final admission that "the advent of Man
may be considered as inaugurating a new and distinct epoch, that in which we now are, and during
the whole of which the physical conditions of existence cannot have been very materially different
from what they are now;" (p. 216;) and that "thus much is clear, that Man's existence on Earth
is brief, compared with the ages during which unreasoning creatures were the sole possessors
of the globe:" (p. 217:)--these statements, I say, contain as much as one desires to see admitted.
For really, since the fossil Flora, and the various races of animated creatures which Geologists
have classified with so much industry and skill, confessedly belong to a period of immemorial
antiquity; and, with very rare exceptions indeed, represent extinct species,--I, as an interpreter
of Scripture, am not at all concerned with them. Moses asserts nothing at all about them, one
way or the other. What Revelation says, is, that nearly 6000 years ago, after a mighty catastrophe,--unexplained
alike in its cause, its nature, and its duration,--the Creator of the Universe instituted upon
the surface of this Earth of ours that order of things which has continued ever since; and
which is observed at this instant to prevail: that He was pleased to parcel out His transcendent
operations, and to spread them over Six Days; and that He ceased from the work of Creation
on the Seventh Day. All extant species, whether of the vegetable or the animal Kingdom, including
Man himself, belong to the week in question. And this statement, as it has never yet been found
untrue, so am I unable to anticipate by what possible evidence it can ever be set aside as false.

In my IInd Sermon, I have ventured to review the Mosaic record sufficiently in detail, to render
it superfluous that I should retrace any portion of it here. The reader is requested to read
at least so much of what has been offered as is contained from p. 28 to p. 32. My business
at present is with Mr. Goodwin.

And in limine I have to remind him that he has really no right first to give, in his own words,
his own notion of the history of Creation; and then to insist on making the Revelation of the
same transaction ridiculous by giving it also in words of his own, which become in effect a
weak parody of the original. What is there in Genesis about "the air or wind fluttering over
the waters of the deep?" (p. 219.) Is this meant for the august announcement that "the SPIRIT
of GOD moved upon the face of the waters?"--"On the third day, ... we wish to call attention
to the fact that trees and plants destined for food are those which are particularly singled
out as the earliest productions of the earth." (p. 220.) The reverse is the fact; as a glance
at Gen. i. 11. will shew.--"The formation of the stars" on the fourth day, "is mentioned in
the most cursory manner." (p. 221.) But who is not aware that "the formation of the stars"
is nowhere mentioned in this chapter at all?

"Light and the measurement of time," (proceeds Mr. Goodwin,) "are represented as existing before
the manifestation of the Sun." (p. 219.) Half of this statement is true; the other half is
false. The former idea, he adds, is "repugnant to our modern knowledge." (p. 219.) Is then
Mr. Goodwin really so weak as to imagine that our Sun is the sole source of Light in Creation?
Whence then the light of the so-called fixed Stars? But I shall be told that Mr. Goodwin speaks
of our system only, and of our Earth in particular. Then pray, whence that glory[103] which
on a certain night on a mountain in Galilee, caused the face of our REDEEMER to shine as the
Sun[104] and His raiment to emit a dazzling lustre[105]? "We may boldly affirm," (he says,)
"that those for whom [Gen. i. 3-5] was penned could have taken it in no other sense than that
light existed before and independently of the sun." (p. 219.) We may indeed. And I as boldly
affirm that I take the passage in that sense myself: moreover that I hold the statement which
Mr. Goodwin treats so scornfully, to be the very truth which, in the deep counsels of GOD,
this passage was designed to convey to mankind; even that "the King of Kings, and LORD of Lords,
who only hath immortality, dwelleth in the Light which no man can approach unto[106]."

"The work of the second day of Creation is to erect the vault of Heaven (Heb. Rakia; Gr. στερέωμα
Lat. Firmamentum,) which is represented as supporting an ocean of water above it. The waters
are said to be divided, so that some are below, and some above the vault.... No quibbling about
the derivation of the word Rakia, which is literally 'something beaten out,' can affect the
explicit description of the Mosaic writer contained in the words 'the waters that are above
the firmament,' or avail to shew that he was aware that the sky is but transparent space."
(pp. 219, 220.) "The allotted receptacle [of Sun and Moon] was not made until the Second Day,
nor were they set in it until the fourth." (p. 221.) Surely I cannot be the only reader to
whom the impertinence of this is as offensive, as its shallowness is ridiculous! In spite of
Mr. Goodwin's uplifted finger, and menacing cry,--"No quibbling!" I proceed with my inquiry.

For first; Why does Mr. Goodwin parody the words of Inspiration? The account as given by Moses
is,--"And GOD said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide
the waters from the waters[108]." But surely, to make the "open firmament of Heaven" in which
every winged fowl may fly[109], is not "to erect the vault of Heaven,"--"a permanent solid
vault,"--"supporting an ocean of water!"

The Hebrew word here used to denote "firmament," on which Mr. Goodwin's indictment turns, ("rakia,")
is derived from a verb which means to "beat." Now, what is beaten, or hammered out, while (if
it be a metal) it acquires extension, acquires also solidity. The Septuagint translators seem
to have fastened upon the latter notion, and accordingly represented it by στερέωμα; for which,
the earliest Latin translators of the Old Testament coined an equivalent,--firmamentum. But
that Moses by the word "rakia" intended rather to denote the expanse overhead, than to predicate
solidity for the sky, I suspect will be readily admitted by all. True that in the poetical
book of Job, we read that the sky is "strong, as a molten looking-glass[110]:" but then we
meet more frequently with passages of a different tendency. God is said to "stretch out the
heavens like a curtain[111]," "and spread them out as a tent to dwell in[112]:" to "bind up
the waters in His thick clouds[113]," and "in a garment[114]," &c., &c.[115] It is only needful
to look out the word in the dictionary of Gesenius to see that spreading out, (as of thin plates
of metal by a hammer,) is the only notion which properly belongs to the word. Accordingly,
the earliest modern Latin translation from the Hebrew, (that of Pagninus,) renders the word
expansio. And so the word has stood for centuries in the margin of our English Bible.

The actual fact of the case,--the truth concerning the physical phenomenon alluded to,--comes
in, and surely may be allowed to have some little weight. Since expansion is a real attribute
of the atmosphere which divides the waters above from the waters below,--and solidity is not,--it
seems to me only fair, seeing that the force of the expression is thought doubtful, to assign
to it the meaning which is open to fewest objections.

But "the Hebrews," (says Mr. Goodwin,) "understood the sky, firmament, or heaven to be a permanent
solid vault, as it appears to the ordinary observer." This, he adds, is "evident enough from
various expressions made use of concerning it. It is said to have pillars[116], foundations[117],
doors[118], and windows[119],"--(p. 220.) Now, I really do not think Mr. Goodwin's inference
by any means so "evident" as he asserts. If Heaven has "pillars" in the poetical book of Job,
so has the Earth[120]. The "foundations" spoken of in 2 Sam. xxii. 8, seem rather to belong
to Earth than to Heaven,--as a reference to the parallel place in Ps. xviii. 7 will shew[121].
Is Mr. Goodwin so little of a poet, as to be staggered by the phrase "windows of Heaven," when
it occurs in the figurative language of an ancient people, and in a poetical book[122]?

For the foregoing reasons, I distrust Mr. Goodwin's inference that "the Hebrews understood
the sky to be a solid vault, furnished with pillars, foundations, doors, and windows." But
whether they did, or did not, it is to be hoped that he is enough of a logician to perceive
that the popular notions of God's ancient people on this subject, are not the thing in question.
The only FACT we have to do with is clearly this,--that Moses has in this place employed the
word "rakia:" and the only QUESTION which can be moved about it, is (as evidently) the following,--whether
he was, or was not, to blame in employing that word; for as to the meaning which he, individually,
attached to the phenomenon of which "rakia" is the name, it cannot be pretended that any one
living knows anything at all about the matter. A Greek, Latin, or French astronomer who should
speak of Heaven, would not therefore be assumed to mean that it is hollow; although κοῖλον,
'coelum,' 'ciel,' etymologically imply no less.

Now I contend that Moses employed the word "rakia" with exactly the same propriety, neither
more nor less, as when a Divine now-a-days employs the English word "firmament." It does not
follow that the man who speaks of "the spacious firmament on high," is under so considerable
a delusion as to suspect that the firmament is a firm thing; nor does it follow that Moses
thought that "rakia" was a solid substance either,--even if solidity was the prevailing etymological
notion in the word, and even if the Hebrews were no better philosophers than Mr. Goodwin would
have us believe. The Essayist's objection is therefore worthless. GOD was content that Moses
should employ the ordinary language of his day,--accommodate himself to the forms of speech
then prevalent,--coin no new words. What is there unreasonable in the circumstance? What possible
ground does it furnish for a supposition that the etymological force of the word,--or even
that the popular physical theory of which that word may, or may not, have once been the connotation,--denoted
the sense in which Moses employed it? Is it to be supposed that when a physician speaks of
a "jovial temperament," he insinuates his approval of an exploded system of medicine? Do astronomers
maintain that the Sun has a disk, or the Earth an axis? that the former leaves its place in
the heavens when it suffers 'eclipse[123]?' or that the latter has a superior latitude, from
East to West? To give the most familiar instance of all,--Do scientific men believe that the
sun rises, and sets?--And yet all say that it does, until this hour!... Why is Moses to be
judged by a less favourable standard than anybody else,--than Shakspeare, than Hooker, even
than Mr. Goodwin? The first, in an exquisite passage, bids Jessica,--

                  "Look how the floor of heav'n
    Is thick inlayed with patens of bright gold."

Did Shakspeare expect his beautiful language would be tortured into a shape which would convict
him of talking nonsense?--But this is poetry. Then take Hooker's prose:--

     "If the frame of that heavenly arch erected over our heads should
     loosen and dissolve itself; ... if the Moon should wander from her
     beaten way[124]," &c.

Did Hooker suppose that heaven is "an arch," which could be "loosened and dissolved?" or that
"the way" of the moon is "beaten?"--But this is a highly poetical passage, written three centuries
ago.--Let an unexceptionable witness then be called; and so, let the question be brought to
definite issue. I, for my part, am quite content that it shall be the philosopher in person.
The present Essayist shall be heard discoursing about Creation, and shall be convicted out
of his own mouth. Mr. Goodwin begins his paper by a kind of cosmogony of his own, which he
prefaces with the following apology:--"It will be necessary for our purpose to go over the
oft-trodden ground, which must be done with rapid steps. Nor let the reader object to be reminded
of some of the most elementary facts of his knowledge. The human race has been ages in arriving
at conclusions now familiar to every child." (p. 212.) After this preamble, he begins his "elementary
facts," as follows:--

"This Earth, apparently so still and stedfast, lying in majestic repose beneath the ætherial
vault,"--(p. 212.)

But we remonstrate immediately. "The ætherial vault!" (p. 220.)

"The Sun which seems to leap up each morning from the east, and traversing the skyey bridge,"--(p.
212.)

"The skyey bridge!" And pray in what part of the universe do you discover a "skyey bridge?"
Is not this calculated "to convey to ordinary apprehensions an impression at variance with
facts?" (p. 231.)

"The Moon which occupies a position in the visible heavens only second to the Sun, and far
beyond that of every other celestial body in conspicuousness,"--(p. 212.)

Nay, but really Mr. Philosopher, while you remind us "of some of the most elementary facts
of our knowledge," (p. 212,) you write (except in the matter of the "leaping Sun" and the "skyey
bridge,")--exactly as Moses does in the first chapter of Genesis! He writes with the flippancy
of a youth in his teens, who having just mastered the elements of natural science, is impatient
to acquaint the world with his achievement. His powers of dogmatism are unbounded; but he betrays
his ignorance at every step. The Divine decree, "Let us make Man in Our image, after Our likeness[125],"
he explains by remarking that "the Pentateuch abounds in passages shewing that the Hebrews
contemplated the Divine being in the visible form of a man." (!!!) (p. 221.) A foot-note contains
the following oracular dictum,--"See particularly the narrative in Genesis xviii." What can
be said to such an ignoramus as this? Hear him dogmatizing in another subject-matter:--"The
common arrangement of the Bible in chapters is of comparatively modern origin, and is admitted
on all hands to have no authority or philological worth whatever. In many cases the division
is most preposterous." (p. 222.) That the division of chapters is occasionally infelicitous,
is true: but is Mr. Goodwin weak enough to think that he could divide them better? The division
into chapters and verses again is not so modern as Mr. Goodwin fancies. Dr. M'Caul, (in a pamphlet
on the Translation of the Bible,) shews reason for suspecting that some of the divisions of
the Old Testament Scriptures are as old as the time of Ezra.

To return, and for the last time, to Mr. Goodwin's Essay.--His object is, (with how much of
success I have already sufficiently shewn,) (1) To fasten the charge of absurdity and ignorance
on the ancient Prophet who is confessedly the author of the Book of Genesis: (2) To prove that
a literal interpretation of Gen. i., "will not bear a moment's serious discussion." (p. 230.)
I look through his pages in vain for the wished-for proof. He has many strong assertions. He
puts them forth with not a little insolence. But he proves nothing! At p. 226, however, I read
as follows:--"Dr. Buckland appears to assume that when it is said that the Heaven and the Earth
were created in the beginning, it is to be understood that they were created in their present
form and state of completeness, the heaven raised above the earth as we see it, or seem to
see it now." (pp. 226-7.)

But Dr. Buckland "appears to assume" nothing of the kind. His words are,--"The first verse
of Genesis seems explicitly to assert the creation of the Universe: the Heaven, including the
sidereal systems,--and the Earth, ... the subsequent scene of the operations of the six days
about to be described." (pp. 224-5.)

"This," continues Mr. Goodwin, "is the fallacy of his argument." (p. 227.)

But if this is "the fallacy of his argument," we have already seen that it is a fallacy which
rests not with Dr. Buckland, but with Mr. Goodwin. He proceeds:--

"The circumstantial description of the framing of the Heaven out of the waters proves that
the words 'Heaven and Earth,' in the first verse, must be taken proleptically."--(p. 227.)

But we may as well stop the torrent of long words, by simply pointing out that "the heavens,"
(hashamaim,) spoken of in Gen. i. 1, are quite distinct from "the firmament," (rakia,) spoken
of in ver. 6. The word is altogether different, and the sense is evidently altogether different
also; although Mr. Goodwin seeks to identify the two[126]. And further, we take leave to remind
our modern philosopher that no "circumstantial description of the framing of the heaven out
of the waters," is to be found either in ver. 6, or elsewhere. And this must suffice.

The entire subject shall be dismissed with a very few remarks.--Mr. Goodwin delights in pointing
out the incorrectness of "the sense in which the Mosaic narrative was taken by those who first
heard it:" (p. 223:) and in asserting "that this meaning is primâ facie one wholly adverse
to the present astronomical and geological views of the Universe." (p. 223.) But we take leave
to remind this would-be philosopher that "the idea which entered into the minds of those to
whom the account was first given," (p. 230,) is not the question with which we have to do when
we are invited to a "frank recognition of the erroneous views of Nature which the Bible contains."
(p. 211.) "It is manifest,"--(in this I cordially agree with Mr. Goodwin,)--"that the whole
account is given from a different point of view from that which we now unavoidably take:" (p.
223:) and, (I beg leave to add,) that point of view is somewhere in Heaven,--not here on Earth!
The "Mosaic Cosmogony," as Mr. Goodwin phrases it, (fond, like all other smatterers in Science,
of long words,) is a Revelation: and the same HOLY GHOST who gave it, speaking by the mouth
of St. John, not obscurely intimates that it is mystical, like the rest of Holy Scripture,--that
is, that it was fashioned not without a reference to the Gospel[127]. But we are touching on
a high subject now, of which Mr. Goodwin does not understand so much as the Grammar. He is
thinking of the structure of the globe: we are thinking of the structure of the Bible. But
to return to Earth, we inform the Essayist that it is simply unphilosophical, even absurd,
for him to insist on what shall be implied by certain words employed by Moses,--(of which he
judges by their etymology;) and further to assume what erroneous physical theories those words
must have been connected with, by his countrymen, and so forth; and straightway to hold up
the greatest of the ancient prophets to ridicule, as if those notions and those theories were
all his!

"After all," (as Dr. Buckland remarked, long since,) "it should be recollected that the question
is not respecting the correctness of the Mosaic narrative, but of our interpretation of it:"
(p. 231:)--"a proposition," (proceeds Mr. Goodwin,) "which can hardly be sufficiently reprobated."
But I make no question which of these two writers is most entitled to reprobation. For the
view which will be found advocated in Sermon II., (which is substantially Dr. Buckland's,)
(p. 24 to p. 32,) it shall but be said that it recommends itself to our acceptance by the strong
fact that it takes no liberty with the sacred narrative, whatever; and receives the Revelation
of GOD in all its strangeness, (which it cannot be a great mistake to do;) without trying to
reconcile it with supposed discoveries, (wherein we may fail altogether.) I defy anybody to
shew that it is impossible that GOD may have disposed of the actual order of the Universe,
as in the first chapter of Genesis He is related to have done; and probability can clearly
have no place in such a speculation. I would only just remind the thoughtful student of Scripture,
and indeed of Nature also, that the singular analogy which Geologists think they discover between
successive periods of Creation, and the Mosaic record of the first Six Days, is no difficulty
to those who hesitate to identify those Days with the irregular Periods of indefinite extent.
Rather was it to have been expected, I think, that such an analogy would be found to subsist
between His past and His present working, when, 6,000 years ago, GOD arranged the actual system
of things in Six Days.--Neither need we feel perplexed if Hugh Miller was right in the conclusion
at which, he says, he had been "compelled to arrive;" viz. that "not a few" of the extant species
of animals "enjoyed life in their present haunts" "for many long ages ere Man was ushered into
being;" (p. 229.) I find it nowhere asserted by Moses that the severance was so complete, and
decisively marked, between previous cycles of Creation and that cycle which culminated in the
creation of Man, that no single species of the præ-Adamic period was reproduced by the Omnipotent,
to serve as a connecting link, as it were, between the Old world and the New,--an identifying
note of the Intelligence which was equally at work on this last, as on all those former occasions.
On the other hand, I do find it asserted by Geologists that between the successive præ-Adamic
cycles such connecting links are discoverable; and this fact makes me behold in the circumstance
supposed fatal to the view here advocated, the strongest possible confirmation of its accuracy.
At the same time, it is admitted that in every department of animated and vegetable life, the
severance between the last (or Mosaic) cycle of Creation, and all those cycles which preceded
it, is very broadly marked[128].

Mr. Goodwin's method contrasts sadly with that of the several writers he adduces,--whether
Naturalists or Divines. Those men, believing in the truth of GOD'S Word, have piously endeavoured,
(with whatever success,) to shew that the discoveries of Geology are not inconsistent with
the revelations of Genesis. But he, with singular bad taste, (to use no stronger language,)
makes no secret of the animosity with which he regards the inspired record; and even finds
"the spectacle of able, and we doubt not conscientious writers engaging in attempting the impossible,--painful
and humiliating." He says, "they evidently do not breathe freely over their work; but shuffle
and stumble over their difficulties in a piteous manner." (p. 250.) He asserts dogmatically
that "the interpretation proposed by Buckland to be given to the Mosaic description, will not
bear a moment's serious discussion:" (p. 230:) while Hugh Miller "proposes to give an entirely
mythical or enigmatical sense to the Mosaic narrative." (p. 236.) He is clamorous that we should
admit the teaching of Scripture to be "to some extent erroneous." (p. 251.) He "recognizes
in it, not an authentic utterance of Divine Knowledge, but a human utterance." (p. 253.) "Why
should we hesitate," (he asks,) "to recognize the fallibility of the Hebrew writers?" (p. 251.)

With one general reflexion, I pass on to the next Essay.--The Works of GOD, the more severely
they have been questioned, have hitherto been considered to bear a more and more decisive testimony
to the Wisdom and the Goodness of their Author. The animal and the vegetable kingdoms have
been made Man's instructors for ages past; and ever since the microscope has revealed so many
unsuspected wonders, the argument from contrivance and design, Creative Power and infinite
Wisdom, has been pressed with increasing cogency. The Heavens, from the beginning, have been
felt to "declare the glory of GOD." One department only of Nature, alone, has all along remained
unexplored. Singular to relate, the Records of Creation, (as the phenomena of Geology may I
suppose be properly called,)--though the most obvious phenomena of all,--have been throughout
neglected. It was not till the other day that they were invited to give up their weighty secrets;
and lo, they have confessed them, willingly and at once. The study of Geology does but date
from yesterday; and already it aspires to the rank of a glorious Science. Evidence has been
at once furnished that our Earth has been the scene of successive cycles of Creation; and the
crust of the globe we inhabit is found to contain evidence of a degree of antiquity which altogether
defies conjecture. The truth is, that Man, standing on a globe where his deepest excavations
bear the same relation to the diameter which the scratch of a pin invisible to the naked eye,
bears to an ordinary globe;--learns that his powers of interrogating Nature break down marvellous
soon: yet Nature is observed to keep from him no secrets which he has the ability to ask her
to give up.

In the meantime, the attitude assumed by certain pretenders to Physical Science at these discoveries,
cannot fail to strike any thoughtful person as extraordinary. Those witnesses of GOD'S work
in Creation, which have been dumb for ages only because no man ever thought of interrogating
them, are now regarded in the light of depositaries of a mighty secret; which, because GOD
knew that it would be fatal to the credit of His written Word, He had bribed them to keep back,
as long as, by shuffling and equivocation, they found concealment practicable. It seems to
be fancied, however, that that fatal secret the determination of Man has wrung from their unwilling
lips, at last; and lo, on confronting GOD with these witnesses, He is convicted even by His
own creatures of having spoken falsely in His Word[129].--Such, I say, is the tone assumed
of late by a certain school of pretenders to Physical Science.

What need to declare that to the well-informed eye of Faith,--(and surely Faith is here the
perfection of Reason! for Faith, remember, is the correlative not of Reason, but of Sight;)--the
phenomenon presented is of a widely different character. Faith, or rather Reason, looks upon
GOD'S Works as a kind of complement of His Word. He who gave the one, gave the other also.
Moreover, He knew that He had given it. So far from ministering to unbelief, or even furnishing
grounds for perplexity, the record of His Works was intended, according to His gracious design,
to supply what was lacking to our knowledge in the record of His Word.... "Behold My footprints,
(He seems to say,) across the long tract of the ages! I could not give you this evidence in
My written Word. The record would have been out of place, and out of time. It would have been
unintelligible also. But what I knew would be inexpedient in the page of Revelation, I have
given you abundantly in the page of Nature. I have spared your globe from combustion, which
would have effaced those footprints,--in order that the characters might be plainly decipherable
to the end of Time.... O fools and blind, to have occupied a world so brimful of wonders for
wellnigh 6000 years, and only now to have begun to open your eyes to the structure of the earth
whereon ye live, and move, and have your being! Yea, and the thousandth part of the natural
wonders by which ye are surrounded has not been so much as dreamed of, by any of you, yet!...
O learn to be the humbler, the more ye know; and when ye gaze along the mighty vista of departed
ages, and scan the traces of what I was doing before I created Man,--multiply that problem
by the stars which are scattered in number numberless over all the vault of Heaven; and learn
to confess that it behoves the creature of an hour to bow his head at the discovery of his
own littleness and blindness; and that his words concerning the Ancient of Days had need to
be at once very wary, and very few!"

VI. By far the ablest of these seven Essays is from the pen of the "REV. MARK PATTISON, B.D.,
Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford." It purports to be an Essay on the "TENDENCIES OF RELIGIOUS
THOUGHT IN ENGLAND, 1688-1750;" but it can hardly be said to correspond with that description.
In the concluding paragraph, the learned writer gives to his work a different name. It is declared
to be "The past History of the Theory of Belief in the Church of England[130]." But neither
the title at the head, nor the title at the tail of the Essay, gives any adequate notion of
the Author's purpose.

Had we met with this production, isolated, in the pages of a Review, we should have probably
passed it by as the work of a clever man, who, after amusing himself to some extent with the
Theological literature of the last century, had desired to preserve some record of his reading;
and had here thrown his random jottings into connected form. There is a racy freshness in a
few of Mr. Pattison's sketches, (as in his account of Bentley's controversy with Collins[131],)
which forcibly suggests the image of an artist whose pencil cannot rest amid scenery which
stimulates his imagination. To be candid, we are inclined to suspect that, in the first instance,
something of this sort was in reality all that the learned author had in view. But we are reluctantly
precluded from putting so friendly a construction on these seventy-six pages. Not only does
Mr. Pattison's Essay stand between Mr. Goodwin's open endeavour to destroy confidence in the
writings of Moses, and Professor Jowett's laborious insinuations that the Bible is only an
ordinary book; but it claims a common purpose and intention with both those writers. We proceed
therefore to examine his labours by the aid of the clue which he has himself supplied. For
when nine editions of a book appear in quick succession, prefaced by a description of the spirit
in which "it is hoped that the volume will he received,"--it seems a pity that the author should
not be judged by the standard of his own choosing.

We are surprised then to find how slightly Mr. Pattison's Essay fulfils its avowed purpose.
The learned author does not, in fact, directly "handle" the class of subjects referred to,
at all: or if he does, it is achieved in a couple of pages. And yet it is not difficult to
point out the part which his Essay performs in the general scheme of this guilty volume. With
whatever absence of "concert or comparison" the authors may have severally written, the fatal
effect of their combined endeavours is not more apparent than the part sustained by each Essay
singly in promoting it.

While Mr. Goodwin demolishes the Law, and Dr. Williams disbelieves the Prophets; while Professor
Powell denies the truth of Miracles, and Professor Jowett evacuates the authority of Holy Scripture
altogether--while Dr. Temple substitutes the inner light of Conscience for an external Revelation;
and Mr. Wilson teaches men how they may turn the substance of Holy Scripture into a shadow,
evade the plain force of language, and play fast and loose with those safeguards which it has
been ever thought that words supply;--Mr. Pattison, reviewing the last century and a half of
our own Theological history, labours hard to produce an impression that, here also "all is
vanity and vexation of spirit." He calls off our attention from the Bible, and bids us contemplate
the unlovely aspect of the English "religious world" from the Revolution of 1688 down to the
publication of the 'Tracts for the Times,' in 1833[133]. "Be content for a while, (he seems
to say,) to disregard the prize; and observe the combatants instead. Listen to the historian
of moral and religious progress," while he depicts "decay of religion, licentiousness of morals,
public corruption, profaneness of language, a day of rebuke and blasphemy." Come attend to
me; and I will draw the likeness of "an age destitute of depth or earnestness; an age whose
poetry was without romance, whose philosophy was without insight, and whose public men were
without character; an age of 'light without love,' whose 'very merits were of the earth, earthy.'"
(p. 254.) "If we would understand our own position in the Church, and that of the Church in
the age; if we would hold any clue through the maze of religious pretension which surrounds
us; we cannot neglect those immediate agencies in the production of the present, which had
their origin towards the beginning of the eighteenth century." (p. 256.) Let us then "trace
the descent of religious thought, and the practical working of the religious ideas," (p. 255,)
through some of the phases they have more recently assumed. You shall see the Apostles tried
on a charge "of giving false witness in the case of the Resurrection of JESUS;" (p. 303;) and
pronounced "not guilty," by one whose "name once commanded universal homage among us;" but
who now, (!) with South (!!) and Barrow, (!!!) "excites perhaps only a smile of pity." (p.
265.) You shall be shewn Bentley in his attack on Collins the freethinker, enjoying "rare sport,"--"rat-hunting
in an old rick;" and "laying about him in high glee, braining an authority at every blow."
(p. 308.) "Coarse, arrogant, and abusive, with all Bentley's worst faults of style and temper,
this masterly critique is decisive." (p. 307.) And yet, you are not to rejoice! "The 'Discourse
of Freethinking' was a small tract published in 1713 by Anthony Collins, a gentleman whose
high personal character and general respectability seemed to give a weight to his words, which
assuredly they do not carry of themselves." (p. 307.) [Why, the man ought to have been an Essayist
and Reviewer!] ... "By 'freethinking'" he does but "mean liberty of thought,--the right of
bringing all received opinions whatsoever to the touchstone of reason:" (p. 307:) [a liberty
which has evidently disappeared from English Literature: a right which no man dares any longer
exercise under pain of excommunication!] "Collins was not a sharper, and would have disdained
practices to which Bentley stooped for the sake of a professorship." (p. 310.) [O high-minded
Collins!] "The dirt endeavoured to be thrown on Collins will cleave to the hand that throws
it." (p. 309.) [O dirty Bentley!] And though "Collins's mistakes, mistranslations, misconceptions,
and distortions are so monstrous, that it is difficult for us now, forgetful how low classical
learning had sunk, to believe that they are mistakes, and not wilful errors," (p. 308,)--yet
"Addison, the pride of Oxford, had done no better. (p. 307, quoting Macaulay's Essays.) All
this and much more you shall see. Remember that it is the history of your immediate forefathers
which you will be contemplating,--the morality of the professors of religion during the last
century,--"the past history of the theory of Belief in the Church of England!" (p. 329.)

The curtain falls; and now, pray how do you like it? I invite you, in conclusion, to "take
the religious literature of the present day, as a whole; and endeavour to make out clearly
on what basis Revelation is supposed by it to rest; whether on Authority, on the Inward Light,
on Reason, on self-evidencing Scripture, or on the combination of the four, or some of them,
and in what proportions." (p. 329.) ... After this, you are at liberty to proceed to read 'Jowett
on Inspiration,'--with what appetite you may!

Such is the impression which Mr. Pattison's Essay is calculated to leave behind. That he had
no wicked intention in writing it, no one who knows him could for an instant suppose: but the
effect of what he has done is certainly to set his reader adrift on a dreary sea of doubt.
Discomfort and dissatisfaction, confusion and dismay, are the prevailing sentiments with which
a religious mind, unfortified with learning, will rise from the perusal of the present Essay:
while the irreligious man will study it with a sneer of ill-concealed satisfaction. The marks
of Mr. Pattison's own better knowledge, (sufficiently evident to the quick eye of one who is
aware of the writer's high theological attainments;)--the indications of a truer individual
judgment, (discoverable throughout by one who knows the author's private worth, and is himself
happily in possession of the clue by which to escape from this tangled labyrinth:)--these escape
the common reader. To him, all is dreary doubt.

I must perforce deal with Mr. Pattison's labours in a very summary manner. The chief complaint
I have to make against him is that he has altogether omitted what, to you and to me, is the
most important feature of the century which he professes to describe,--namely, the vast amount
of lofty Churchmanship, the unbroken Catholic tradition, which, with no small amount of general
short-coming, is to be traced throughout the eighteenth century. To insinuate that the return
to Catholic principles began with the publication of the 'Tracts for the Times,' (p. 259,)
in 1833, is simply to insinuate what is not true. But Mr. Pattison does more than 'insinuate.'
He states it openly. "In constructing Catenæ Patrum," (he says,) "the Anglican closes his list
with Waterland or Brett, and leaps at once to 1833." (p. 255.)--Now, since Waterland died in
1740 and Brett in 1743, it is clear that, (according to Mr. Pattison,) a hundred years and
upwards have to be cleared per saltum: during which the lamp of Religion in these kingdoms
had gone fairly out. But how stands the truth? At least four "Catenæ Patrum" are given in the
"Tracts for the Times[134];" not one of which is closed with Waterland or Brett. On the contrary,
in the two former Catenæ (beginning with Jewel and Hooker) the names of these supposed 'ultimi
Romanorum' occur little more than half way!... "Les faits," therefore, (as usual with 'Essayists
and Reviewers,')--"les faits sont contraires."--It would be enough to cite Bethell's 'General
View of the Doctrine of Regeneration in Baptism,' which appeared in 1822; and Hugh James Rose's
'Discourses on the Commission and Duties of the Clergy,' which were preached in 1826. But the
case against Mr. Pattison, as I shall presently shew, is abundantly stronger.

In short, to exclude from sight, as this author so laboriously endeavours to do, the Catholic
element of the last century and the early part of the present, is extremely unfair. There had
never failed in the Church of England a succession of illustrious men, who transmitted the
Divine fire unimpaired, down to yesterday. Quenched in some places, the flame burned up brightly
and beautifully in others. As for the 'Tracts for the Times,' they speedily assumed a party
character: and by the time that ninety-seven of them had appeared, the series was discontinued
by the desire of the Diocesan,--who was yet the friend of its authors. The Tracts do not all,
by any means, represent Anglican (i.e. Catholic) Theology. They were written by a very few
men; while the greatest of those who had materially promoted the Catholic movement out of which
they sprang, (not which they occasioned,) were dissatisfied with them; would not write in them;
kept aloof; and foresaw and foretold what would be the issue of such teaching[135]. And yet,
'Tracts for the Times' did more good than evil, I suppose, on the whole.

The truth is, that in every age, (and the last century forms no exception to the rule,) the
history of the Church on Earth has been a warfare. Mr. Pattison says contemptuously,--"The
current phrases of 'the bulwarks of our faith,' 'dangerous to Christianity,' are but instances
of the habitual position in which we assume ourselves to stand. Even more philosophic minds
cannot get rid of the idea that Theology is polemical." (p. 301.) And pray, whom have we to
thank, but such writers as Mr. Pattison, that it is so? I am one of the many who at this hour
are (unwillingly) neglecting constructive tasks in order to be destructive with Mr. Pattison
and his colleagues! So long as Infidelity abounds, our service must be a warfare. 'The Prince
of Peace' foretold as much, when He prophesied to His Disciples that it would be found that
He had "brought on earth, a sword." May I not add that the unique position which the Church
of England has occupied, ever since her great Reformation in respect both of Doctrine and of
Discipline three centuries ago,--is of a nature which must inevitably subject her to constant
storms? An object of envy to 'Protestant Europe,'--and of hatred to Rome;--exposed to the hostility
of the State, (which would trample her under foot, if it dared,)--and viewed with ill-concealed
animosity by Dissenters of every class;--admitting into her Ministry men of very diverse views,--and
restraining them by scarcely any discipline;--allowing perfect freedom, aye, licentiousness
of discussion,--and tolerating the expression of almost any opinions,--except those of Essayists
and Reviewers:--how shall the Church of England fail to adopt 'the bulwarks of the faith' for
one of her current phrases? how not, many a time, deem 'dangerous to Christianity' the speculations
of her sons?... Nay, polemics must prevail; if only because, in a certain place, the Divine
Speaker already quoted foretells the partial, (if not the entire,) obscuration even of true
Doctrine, in that pathetic exclamation of His,--"When the Son of Man cometh, shall He find
the faith upon the Earth[137]?" ... In the face of all this, it is to confuse and mystify the
ordinary reader to draw such a picture of the last century as Mr. Pattison has drawn here.
As dismal a view might be easily taken of the first, of the second, of the third, of the fourth,
of the fifth century. What Mr. Newman once designated as "ancient, holy, and happy times,"
might very easily indeed be so exhibited as to seem times of confusion and discord, blasphemy
and rebuke. A discouraging picture might be drawn, (I suppose,) of every age of the Church's
history. But in, and by itself, it would never be quite a true picture. For to the eye of Faith
there is ever to be descried, amid the hurly-burly of the storm, the Ark of CHRIST'S Church
floating peacefully over the troubled waters, and making steadily for that Heavenly haven "where
it would be." ... Yes, there is ever some blessed trace discoverable, that this Life of ours
is watched over by One whose Name is Love; whether we con the chequered page of History, Ecclesiastical
or Civil; or summon to our aid the story of our own narrow experience. From the fierce and
fiery opposition, Good is ever found to have resulted; and that Good was abiding. Out of the
weary conflict ever has issued Peace; and that Peace was of the kind which 'passeth all understanding;'
a Peace which the world cannot give,--no, nor take away. There are abundant traces that in
all that has happened to the Church of CHRIST, from first to last, there has been a purpose
and a plan!... No one knows this better than Mr. Pattison. No man in Oxford could have drawn
out what I have been saying into a convincing reality, better than he, had he yielded to the
instincts of a good heart, and directed his fine abilities to their lawful scope.

The character of the last dismal century, Mr. Pattison has drawn with sufficient vividness:
but that century armed the Church, (as we shall be presently reminded,) on the side of the
"Evidences of Religion;" and if it taught her the insufficiency of such a method, the eighteenth
century did its work. Above all, it produced Bishop Butler.--The previous century, (the seventeenth,)
witnessed the supremacy of fanaticism. It saw the monarchy laid prostrate, and the Church trampled
under foot, and the use of the Liturgy prohibited by Act of Parliament. The "Sufferings of
the Clergy" fill a folio volume. But this was the century which produced our great Caroline
Divines! From Bp. Andrewes to Bp. Pearson,--what a galaxy of names! Moreover, on the side of
the Romish controversy, the seventeenth century supplied the Church's armoury for ever,--Stillingfleet,
who died in the year 1699, in a manner closing the strife.--The sixteenth century witnessed
the Reformation of Religion, with all its inevitably attendant evils; an unsettled faith,--gross
public and private injustice,--an illiterate parochial clergy:--yet how goodly a body of sound
Divinity did the controversies of that age call forth! The same century witnessed the rise
of Puritanism; but then, it produced Richard Hooker!--What was the character of the century
which immediately preceded the Reformation,--the fifteenth?... A tangled web of good and evil
has been the Church's history from the very first. The counterpart of what we read of in Eusebius
and Socrates is to be witnessed among ourselves at the present day, and will doubtless be witnessed
to the end! Mean wilee, such names as George Herbert and Nicholas Farrar, Ken and Nelson, Leighton
and Bishop Wilson, shine through the gloom like a constellation of quiet stars; to which the
pilgrim lifts his weary eye, and feels that he is looking up to Heaven!

When the spirit of the Age comes into collision with the spirit of the Gospel, the result is
sometimes (as in the earliest centuries,) portentous;--sometimes, (as in the last,) simply
deplorable and grievous. The battle which seems to be at present waging is of a different nature.
Physical Science has undertaken the perilous task of hardening herself against the GOD of Nature.
We shall probably see this unnatural strife prolonged for many years to come;--to be succeeded
by some fresh form of irreligion. Somewhat thus, I apprehend, will it be to the end: and the
men of every age will in those conflicts find their best probation; and it will still be the
office of the Creator, in this way to separate the Light from the Darkness,--until the dawn
of the everlasting Morning!

It is not proposed to enter into the Rationalism of the last century, therefore; or to inquire
into the causes of the barren lifeless shape into which Theology then, for the most part, threw
itself. I have never made that department of Ecclesiastical History my study: and who does
not turn away from what is joyless and dreary, to greener meadows, and more fertile fields?
It shall only be remarked that when the Credibility of Religion is the thing generally denied,
Evidences will of necessity be the form which much of the Theological writing of the Day will
assume. Let it not be imagined for an instant that one is the apologist of what Mr. Pattison
has characterized as "an age of Light without Love." (p. 254.) But I insist that the theological
picture of the last century is incomplete, until attention has been called to the many redeeming
features which it presents, and which are all of a re-assuring kind.

Thus, in the department of sacred scholarship, who can forgot that our learned John Mill, in
1707, gave to the world that famous edition of the New Testament which bears his name, after
thirty years of patient toil? Who can forget our obligations in Hebrew, to Kennicott? (1718-1783.)
Humphrey Hody's great work on the Text, and older Versions of Holy Scripture, was published
in 1705.--Bingham's immortal 'Origines' began to appear in 1708; and William Cave lived till 1714.

In the same connexion should be mentioned Bp. Gibson, who died in 1748, and Humphrey Prideaux,
whose 'Connexion' is dated 1715. Pococke died on the eve of the commencement of the last century
(1691); but so great a name casts a bright beam through the darkness which Mr. Pattison describes
so forcibly. Archbishop Wake died in 1737. Warton, the author of 'Anglia Sacra,' died at the
age of 35 in 1695.

Survey next the field of Divinity, properly so called; and in the face of Mr. Pattison's rash
statement that "we have no classical Theology since 1660," (p. 265,) take notice that Bp. Bull,
one of the greatest Divines which the Church of CHRIST ever bred, did not begin to write until
1669, and lived to the year 1709. This was the man, remember, who received the thanks of the
whole Gallican Church for his 'Judicium Ecclesiæ Catholicæ,' (i.e. his learned assertion of
our SAVIOUR'S GODhead[138];)--the man whose writings would have won him the reverence and affection
of Athanasius and Augustine and Basil, had he lived in their day; for he had a mind like theirs.
Bp. Pearson did not die till 1686. Bp. Beveridge wrote till his death in 1707. Fell, the learned
editor of Cyprian, died in 1686: Stillingfleet lived till 1699. Wall's History of Infant Baptism
appeared in 1705. Wheatly, who led the way in liturgical inquiry, was alive till 1742; and
Bp. Patrick was a prolific writer till his death in 1707. May we not also claim the excellent
and learned Grabe as altogether one of ourselves?

Such names do not require special comment. They are their own best eulogium, and present a
high title to their country's gratitude. The name of Prebendary Lowth, (the author of an excellent
commentary on the prophets,) reminds us that there was living till 1732 one who fully appreciated
the calling of an Interpreter of God's Word[139]. Bishop Lowth his son, in his great work,
(1753,) recovered the forgotten principle of Hebrew poetry. To convince ourselves what a spirit
existed in some quarters, (notwithstanding the general spread of the very opinions which 'Essayists
and Reviewers' have been so industriously reproducing in our own day,) it is only necessary
to transcribe the title-page of S. Parker's excellent 'Bibliotheca Biblica,' a Commentary on
the Pentateuch, 1720-1735; 'gathered out of the genuine writings of Fathers, Ecclesiastical
Historians, and Acts of Councils down to the year of our LORD 451, being that of the fourth
General Council; and lower, as occasion may require.'--That learned man designed to achieve
a Commentary on the whole Bible on the same laborious plan; but his labours and his life, (at
the age of 50,) were brought to an end in 1730.--Dr. Waterland, born in 1683, and Dr. Jackson,
born in 1686,--two great names!--died respectively in 1740 and 1763.--In 1778, appeared Dr.
Townson's admirable 'Discourses on the Gospels.' The author lived till 1792. Pious Bp. Horne
(1730-1792) has left the best evidence of his ability as a Divine in the Introduction to his
Commentary on the Psalms. Jones of Nayland is found to have lived till 1800. Bp. Horsley, a
great champion of orthodoxy of belief, as well as an excellent commentator, critic, and Sermon
writer, lived till 1806. Not seven years have elapsed since there was to be seen among ourselves
a venerable Divine, who was declared in 1838, by the chief promoter of the 'Tracts for the
Times,' to have "been reserved to report to a forgetful generation what was the Theology of
their Fathers[140]." Martin Joseph Routh, died in 1854, after completing a century of years.
In 1832 appeared his 'Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Opuscula.' His 'Reliquæ Sacræ' had appeared
in 1814. The work was undertaken so far back as 1788. The last volume appeared in 1848, and
concluded with a Catena of authorities on the great question which was denied by the unbelievers
of the last century, and is denied by the 'Essayists and Reviewers' of this[141]. Here then
was one who had borne steady witness in the Church of England to what is her genuine Catholic
teaching from a period dating long before the birth of any one who was concerned with the 'Tracts
for the Times.'

More ancient names present themselves as furnishing exceptions to Mr. Pattison's dreary sentence.
From Abp. Potter and Leslie, down to Abp. Laurence and Van Mildert,--how many might yet be
specified! We have not hitherto mentioned Abp. Leighton, who died in 1684: Hickes, Johnson,
and Brett, who survived respectively till 1715, 1725, and 1743: the truly apostolic Wilson,
Bishop of Sodor and Man (1663-1755,)--a name, by the way, which deserves far more distinct
and emphatic notice than can here be bestowed upon it; and Nelson, the pious author of 'Fasts
and Festivals,' who died in 1715. We had good Iz. Walton, till 1683, and holy Ken till 1711.
Richard Hele, author of 'Select Offices,' (which appeared in 1717,) is a name not forgotten
in Heaven certainly, though little known on Earth; while Kettlewell and Scandret begin a Catena
of which good Bishop Jolly would be only one of the later links. Meanwhile, the reader is requested
to take notice that there were many other excellent Divines of the period under consideration,
(as Long and Horbery;) men who made no great figure indeed, but who were evidently persons
of great piety and sound judgment; while their learning puts that of 'Essayists and Reviewers'
altogether to the blush.

But I have reserved for the last, a truly noble name,--which Mr. Pattison, (with singular bad
taste, to say no worse,) mentions only to disparage. I allude to Dr. Joseph Butler, Bishop
of Durham; whose 'Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course
of Nature,'--remains, at the end of a century, unanswerable as an Apology,--unrivalled as a
text-book,--unexhausted as a mine of suggestive thought. It may be convenient for an 'Essayist
and Reviewer' to declare that "the merit of the Analogy lies in its want of originality." (p.
286.) There was not much originality perhaps in the remark that an apple falls to the ground.
Whatever the faults of the Analogy, that work, under GOD, saved the Church. However "depressing
to the soul" (p. 293.) of Mr. Pattison, it is nevertheless a book which will invigorate Faith,
and brighten Hope, and comfort Charity herself,--long after the spot where he and I shall sleep
has been forgotten: long after our very names will be hard to find.

Let me turn from this illustrious individual, to one whose very name is perhaps unknown. One
loves to think that there are at all times plenty of good men, who are doing GOD'S work in
the world, in quiet corners; but whose names do not perhaps rise to the surface and emerge
into notice, throughout the whole of a long life. Conversely, how many must there be, the blessing
of whose example and influence has extended down from the surface, (where perhaps it was acknowledged
and appreciated by all,) until it made itself felt by the humblest units of a lowly country
parish!... The obscure village of Finmere, (in Oxfordshire,) was so happy as to enjoy for its
Rector, from 1734 to 1771, the Rev. Thomas Long, M.A.,--"a man," (says the Register,) "of the
most exemplary piety and charity." He presented to the church twelve acres of land, "charging
it with a yearly payment of fifteen shillings to the Clerk, as a recompense to him for attending
on the Fasts and Festivals; and ordering sixpence to be deducted from the payment, for each
time the Clerk failed to attend on those days,--unless let by sickness." About ten years ago,
there was found in the hands of a labouring man at Finmere, a solitary copy of a printed "Lecture,"
by this individual, "addressed to the young persons" of the village, (1762,) which begins as
follows:--"I have usually, once every three years, gone through a course of Lectures upon the
Catechism; but considering my age and great infirmities, it is not very probable I should continue
this practice any longer. I am willing therefore, as a small monument of my care and affection
for you, to print the last of these Lectures," &c.... What heart so dull as not to admit that
men like this, (and there were many of them!) are quite good enough to redeem an age from indiscriminate
opprobrium and unmitigated contempt?

Shall we omit, after this enumeration, to notice the singular fact that Discipline still lingered
on,--even the discipline of public penance,--until within the memory of aged persons yet living?
Merchants in the city of London wore mourning during Lent, within the present century. It is
only within the last thirty years that formulæ expressive of reliance on the Divine blessing
have been expunged from bills-of-lading, and similar printed documents. In the beginning of
the period discoursed of by Mr. Pattison, (viz. in the year 1714,) the excellent Robert Nelson,
in "An Address to Persons of Quality and Estate," proposed as objects for the generosity of
the affluent, such institutions as the following:--"the creating of Charity Schools,"--of "Parochial
Libraries in the meanly endowed Cures throughout England,"--of "a superior School for training
up Schoolmasters and Schoolmistresses,"--and of "Colleges or Seminaries for the Candidates
of Holy Orders." He suggested that there should be "Houses of Hospitality for entertaining
Strangers;" "Suffragan Bishops, both at home and in the Western Plantations;" "Colleges for
receiving Converts from Popery." Some of Nelson's suggestions read like vaticinations. He points
out the need of Ladies' Colleges,--of a Hospital for Incurables,--of Ragged Schools, (for what
else is a school "for the distressed children called the Black-guard?"),--and of Houses of
Mercy for the reception of penitent fallen women.--Is it right to speak of a century which
could freely contemplate such works as these and carry into execution many of them[142], without
some allusion to the leaven which was at work beneath the dry crust of Society? the living
Catholic energy which neither the average dulness of the pulpit could quench, nor the lifeless
morality which had been popularly substituted for Divinity could destroy?

We are abundantly prepared therefore for Mr. Pattison's admission that "public opinion was
throughout on the side of the defenders of Christianity:" (p. 313:)--that, "however a loose
kind of Deism might be the tone of fashionable circles, it is clear that distinct disbelief
of Christianity was by no means the general state of the public mind. The leaders of the Low-Church
and Whig party were quite aware of this. Notwithstanding the universal complaints of the High-Church
party of the prevalence of infidelity, it is obvious that this mode of thinking was confined
to a very small section of society." (p. 313.)

And surely it should not escape us that the peculiar form which unbelief assumed during the
period under discussion, resulted in a benefit to the Church. "The eighteenth century," (says
our author,) "enforced the truths of Natural Morality with a solidity of argument and variety
of proof which they have not received since the Stoical epoch, if then." (p. 296.) "The career
of the Evidential School, its success and its failure, has enriched the history of Doctrine,"
not indeed "with a complete refutation of that method as an instrument of theological investigation,"
(p. 297,) (witness the immortal 'Analogy' of Bishop Butler!)--but, certainly with very precious
experience. That age has bequeathed to the Church a vast body of controversial writing which
she could ill afford to part with at the present day.

So far, we have little to complain of in Mr. Pattison's Essay, except on the side of omission.
But for the fatal circumstance of the company in which the learned writer comes abroad, and
the avowed purpose with which he is found there, a charitable construction might have been
put upon most of the present performance. The following sentences, on the other hand, are not
excusable.

"In the present day when a godless orthodoxy threatens, as in the fifteenth century, to extinguish
religious thought (!) altogether, and nothing is allowed in the Church of England but the formulæ
of past thinkings, which have long lost all sense of any kind, (!) it may seem out of season
to be bringing forward a misapplication of common-sense in a bygone age," (p. 297.)

The "orthodoxy" of the fifteenth century is something new to us. So is the prospect "in the
present day," of an "extinction of religious thought,"--the result of "godless orthodoxy."
The fault, or the misfortune of the Church of England then, is, that she retains "the formulæ
of past thinkings, which have long lost all sense of any kind." (p. 297.) If this does not
mean the English Book of Common Prayer, what does it mean? And if it means the English Prayer-Book,
how can Mr. Pattison retain his commission in the Church of England, and exclusively employ
a Book which he presumes so to characterize?

But this is ad hominem. The learned writer proceeds:--"There are times and circumstances when
religious ideas will be greatly benefited by being submitted to the rough and ready tests by
which busy men try what comes in their way; by being made to stand their trial, and be fully
canvassed, coram populo. As Poetry is not for the critics, so Religion is not for the Theologians."
(p. 297.)

No doubt. But does Mr. Pattison then really mean to tell us that the proper tribunal before
which the Creeds, (for example,) of the Catholic Church,--our Communion and Baptismal offices,--the
structure of our Calendar, and so forth,--should "stand their trial, and be freely canvassed,"
is, "coram populo?" A "rough and ready test," this, of Truth, I grant; aye, a very "rough"
one. But was it ever,--can it ever be,--a fair test? Let us hear Mr. Pattison out, on the subject
of Religion:--

"When it is stiffened into phrases, and these phrases are declared to be objects of reverence
but not of intelligence, it is on the way to become a useless encumbrance; the rubbish of the
past; blocking the road. Theology then retires into the position it occupies in the Church
of Rome at present, an unmeaning frostwork of dogma, out of all relation to the actual history
of Man." (pp. 297-8.)

It cannot be necessary to discuss such sentiments. With Mr. Pattison personally, I will not
condescend to discuss them,--until he has divested himself of that "useless encumbrance," and
ceased to employ daily "that rubbish of the past," which yet the two letters he subjoins to
his name indicate, in the most solemn manner, his reverence for; and which alone make him Reverendus.

But speaking to others,--speaking to you, my friends,--let me point out that "the tendencies
of irreligious thought in England, 1860-1861," are indeed in a direction where the Prayer-Book
is found to be effectually "blocking up the road." (pp. 297-8.) Mr. Pattison is simply dreaming,--haunted
by the phantoms of his own brain, and talking the language of the den,--when he complains that
"the Philosophy, now petrified into tradition, may once have been a vital Faith; but now that"
it is "withdrawn from public life," has ceased to be a "social influence." (p. 298.) And when
he would exalt the last century at the expence of the present, (pp. 298-9,) he shews nothing
so much as the morbid state of his own imagination,--the disordered condition of his own mind.
He has blinded himself; and he will not or he cannot see in the healthier tone of our popular
Divinity,--in the increased attention to the study of Holy Scripture,--in the impulse which
Liturgical inquiries have received since Wheatly's useful volume appeared;--or again, in the
immense number of Schools and Churches which have been recently built,--in the marvellous change
for the better which has come over the Clergy of the Church of England within the present century,--in
the vast development of our Colonial Episcopate within the last few years,--in the rapid increase
of Institutions connected more or less directly with the Church,--and I will add, in the conspicuous
loyalty of the nation;--a practical refutation of his own injurious insinuations; a blessed
earnest that God has not forsaken us; and that we shall yet be a blessing to the World! The
people of England, I am persuaded, are in the main very sincerely attached to their Prayer-Book.
To them, it is not "a useless encumbrance, the rubbish of the past, blocking the road." Nay,
there is a "rough and ready test" of what is the current temper of the age in things religious,
to which I appeal with infinite satisfaction. I mean, the general burst of execration with
which "Essays and Reviews" have been received, from one end of the kingdom to the other. The
censure of all the Bishops, and of both Houses of Convocation; re-echoed, as it has been, through
all ranks of the community, is a great fact;--a fact which I cordially recommend to Mr. Pattison's
attention, when he would philosophize on the religious tendencies of his countrymen.

The age we live in, (Heaven knows!) has many drawbacks. What age of the Church has not had
them? The fatal disposition which prevails to relax all the ancient safeguards,--the desire
to tamper yet further with the Law of Marriage, and to desecrate the Christian Sabbath,--these
are grievous features of the times; which may well occasion alarm and create perplexity. But
nothing of the kind should ever make us despond; much less despair. There is One above "who
is over all, GOD blessed for ever." Shall we not rather seek to employ these advantages which
we have, with a single heart, a single eye to GOD'S glory; and leave the issue, with a generous
confidence, to Him?... It was thus that the great philosophic Divine of the last century comforted
himself, amid darker days than we shall ever experience.

"As different ages have been distinguished by different sorts of particular errors and vices,
the deplorable distinction of ours," (he said,) "is an avowed scorn of Religion in some, and
a growing disregard to it in the generality." "It is impossible for me, my brethren,"--(Butler
is still addressing the clergy of his Diocese, 1761,)--"to forbear lamenting with you the general
decay of Religion in this nation; which is now observed by every one, and has been for some
time the complaint of all serious persons. The influence of it is more and more wearing out
of the minds of men;" while "the number of those who profess themselves unbelievers, increases,
and with their number their zeal. Zeal, it is natural to ask,--for what? Why truly for nothing,
but against everything that is sacred and good among us[143]." And yet, in days dark as those,
Piety could suggest that "no Christian should possibly despair;" and Faith could assign as
the reason of this blessed confidence,--"For He who hath all power in Heaven and Earth, hath
promised that He will be with us to the end of the world."

It is time to dismiss Mr. Pattison's Essay. In doing so, I will not waste my time and yours
by carping at the many errors of detail into which he has (not inexcusably) fallen. These are
the accidents,--not the essence of his paper. The root of bitterness with the Author is, clearly
enough, the Theory of Religious Belief in the Church of England. His concluding words shew
this plainly. The sting of the Essay is in the tail:--

"In the Catholic theory the feebleness of Reason is met half-way, and made good by the authority
of the Church. When the Protestants threw off this authority, they did not assign to Reason
what they took from the Church, but to Scripture. Calvin did not shrink from saying that Scripture
'shone sufficiently by its own light.' As long as this could be kept to, the Protestant theory
of belief was whole and sound. At least it was as sound as the Catholic. In both, Reason, aided
by spiritual illumination, performs the subordinate function of recognising the supreme authority
of the Church, and of the Bible, respectively. Time, learned controversy, and abatement of
zeal, drove the Protestants generally from the hardy but irrational assertion of Calvin. Every
foot of ground that Scripture lost was gained by one or other of the three substitutes: Church-authority,
the Spirit, or Reason. Church-authority was essayed by the Laudian divines, but was soon found
untenable, for on that footing it was found impossible to justify the Reformation and the breach
with Rome." [O shame!] "The SPIRIT then came into favour along with Independency. But it was
still more quickly discovered that on such a basis only discord and disunion could be reared.
There remained to be tried Common Reason, carefully distinguished from recondite learning,
and not based on metaphysical assumptions. To apply this instrument to the contents of Revelation
was the occupation of the early half of the eighteenth century; with what success has been
seen. In the latter part of the century the same Common Reason was applied to the external
evidences. But here the method fails in a first requisite,--universality; for even the shallowest
array of historical proof requires some book-learning to apprehend."--(pp. 328-9.)

Now all this is discreditable to Mr. Pattison as a Philosopher and as a Divine. When did Protestant
England "throw off the authority" of the Church?--What are Calvin's opinions to her?--How does
'Independency,' 'Rationalism,' or any other unsound principle, affect us? Look at our Prayer-Book.
Is it not the same which it was from the beginning? The Sarum Use, reformed and revised, has
been our unbroken heritage as Christian men, from the first. Essentially remodelled in the
days of Edward VI., the recension of our "Laudian Divines" is, (by GOD'S great mercy!) still
ours. What other teaching but that of the Book of Common Prayer, is, to this hour, the authoritative
teaching of the Church of England? Why insinuate there has been vicissitude of Theory, where
notoriously there has been none? Why imply that the storms which periodically sweep over the
citadel of our Zion are effectual to remove the old foundations and to substitute new? What
but a hollow heartless Scepticism can be the result of such an abominable passage as the foregoing?

With a short comment on the proposed problem, I also shall conclude.

No one but a fool would set about the task which Mr. Pattison here proposes. The current "religious
literature of the day" cannot be supposed, for an instant, to be an adequate exponent of the
mind of the Church of England,--or of any other Church. Revelation rests, at this hour, on
exactly the same basis on which it has always rested, and on which it will rest, to the end
of time; let the age be faithful, or faithless,--learned or unlearned,--rationalizing or scientific,--sceptical
or superstitious,--or whatever else you will. And if I am asked to explain myself, I would
humbly say,--(always submitting my own statements in such a matter to the judgment of the Bishops
and Doctors of the Church of England,)--that we receive the Bible on the authority of the Church.
The Church teaches us by the concurrent voices of many Fathers, Doctors, Saints, how to interpret
the Bible; and convinces us that the three Creeds which she delivers to us as her own independent
tradition, may be proved thereby; being in entire conformity with Holy Scripture, though not
originally deduced from it. "Self-evidencing" is hardly a correct epithet to bestow upon Scripture.
And yet, from the evidence which the New Testament supplies to the Old, and from the interpretation
which it puts upon its teaching, we should not despair of proving the Truth of Revelation,
to one who had neither darkened the inward Light, nor perverted his Reason.

In truth, however, it is idle thus to speculate. We have been born into the world during the
nineteenth Century, whether we wish it or not. We have been nourished, (GOD be thanked!) in
the bosom of the Christian Church, whether we would or no. The glory of the Gospel has informed
our natural reason, and we cannot undo the blessed process, strive we as much as we will. The
"inward Light," (as we call it,) is the lingering twilight of the Day of Creation, in the case
of the heathen,--the reflected ray of the noontide of the Gospel, even in the case of the modern
unbeliever. We cannot escape from these conditions of our being, although we may affect to
ignore them, or pretend to turn our eyes the other way. No help however is to be rejected.
No faculty of the soul need be denied the privilege of assisting to convince the doubting heart.
The inward Light may not be disparagingly spoken of: for what if it should prove to be a ray
sent down from the Father of Lights, to illumine the dark places of the soul? The aid of Reason
is not to be excluded; for what is Faith but the highest dictate of the Reason? Faith, (let
us ever remember,) being opposed not to Reason, but to Sight!... And who for a moment supposes
that we disparage the office of Reason, because we speak of the authority of the Church, in
controversies of Faith? We simply proclaim the Church to be the appointed witness and keeper
of Holy Writ; and when we are invited "to make out clearly on what basis Revelation is supposed
to rest," (p. 329,) we point,--where else should we point?--unhesitatingly to her unwavering
witness from the beginning.

VII. His performance is entitled "ON THE INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE:" being, in reality, nothing
else but a laborious denial of its Inspiration.

Mr. Jowett's quarrel is with the whole body of Commentators on the Bible,--ancient and modern;
with the whole Church Catholic. He cannot endure the claim of that Book, (like its Divine object
and Author,) to "a Name which is above every other Name." That Plato and Sophocles should be
capable of but one method of Interpretation, and that the literal,--while the Bible lays claim
to a yet profounder meaning,--so distresses the Regius Professor of Greek, that he has appropriated
to himself almost a quarter of the present volume, in order that he may cast laborious and
systematic ridicule on the very supposition. Some parts of his method I propose presently to
submit to exactly the same "free handling" which he has himself applied to THE WORD OF GOD.
In the meantime, since it is my intention not only to demonstrate the worthlessness of the
structure which Mr. Jowett has with so much perverse industry here built up, by an examination
of some parts of it in detail, but also to pull down as much of the fabric as I am able within
a small compass,--(the construction of something which it is hoped will prove more durable,
being to be found in my IIIrd and IVth, Vth and VIth Sermons,)--I proceed at once to inspect
the foundation-stone of his edifice; and briefly to demonstrate its absolute insecurity.

$1.$ Mr. Jowett's fundamental principle is expressed in the following brief precept: "Interpret
the Scripture like any other book." (p. 377.) To this favourite tune, (although he plays many
intricate variations on it,) he invariably reverts in the end[145]. On this preliminary postulate
therefore, which, at first sight, to a candid mind, seems fair enough, I proceed to remark
as follows:--

Mr. Jowett's formula may be cheerfully and entirely accepted,--apart from the sinister glosses
which he immediately proceeds to put upon it. By all means "Interpret the Scripture like any
other book." Let us see to what result this principle will conduct us. As for the formula itself,
I take the liberty to assume that it ought to mean somewhat as follows:--"Approach the volume
of Holy Scripture with the same candour, and in the same unprejudiced spirit with which you
would approach any other famous book of high antiquity. Study it with at least the same attention.
Give at least equal heed to all its statements. Acquaint yourself at least as industriously
with its method, and with its principle; employing and applying either, with at least equal
fidelity, in its interpretation. Above all, beware of playing tricks with its plain language.
Beware of suppressing any part of the evidence which it supplies as to its own meaning. Be
truthful, and unprejudiced, and honest, and consistent, and logical, and exact throughout,
in your work of Interpretation. 'INTERPRET SCRIPTURE LIKE ANY OTHER BOOK.'"

Now, (not to be tedious,) if this were Mr. Jowett's principle, all further discussion would
be at an end. The general question of the right method of interpreting the Bible would be easily
settled; but it would be hopelessly settled--against the Regius Professor of Greek. As I have
briefly shewn, (from p. 144 to p. 160 of the present volume,) our LORD and His Apostles openly
and repeatedly claim for Scripture that very depth of meaning, that very extent of signification,
which Mr. Jowett so strenuously maintains that it does not possess.--This great fact, he prudently
takes no notice of. He simply ignores it. Either he has overlooked it, through inadvertency:
or he has omitted it, as not perceiving its force and bearing on the question: or he has disingenuously
kept it back. He must choose between these three suppositions. If he has overlooked the fact
on which I lay so much stress,--he is a careless and incompetent reader. If he has failed to
see its force and bearing on the question,--he is a weak and illogical thinker. If he has deliberately
suppressed it, knowing its fatal power,--he is simply a dishonest man. To prevent offence,
I may as well state freely that my entire conviction is that he is simply a weak and illogical
person. My warrant for this opinion is especially the very sad performance of his now under
consideration.

It is clear however that the paraphrase above hazarded does not express Mr. Jowett's principle.
"Interpret the Bible like any other book," means with him something else. And what it does
mean, the Reverend author does not suffer us to doubt. He shews that his meaning is, Interpret
the Bible like any other book, FOR it is like any other book. I proceed to shew that this is
Mr. Jowett's meaning.

It becomes necessary however at once to introduce to the reader's notice the main inference
which, (as already hinted,) flows from Mr. Jowett's favourite position. "Interpret Scripture
like any other book,"--he says. His business is with the Interpretation of "the Jewish and
Christian Scriptures;" and he begins by eagerly assuring us,--and is strenuous in all that
follows to make us believe,--(but simply on à priori grounds!)--that "the true glory and note
of Divinity in these, is not that they have hidden, mysterious, or double meanings; but a simple
and universal one, which is beyond them and will survive them." (p. 332.) "Is it admitted,"
(he asks, at the end of many pages,) "that the Scripture has one and only one true meaning?"
(p. 368.)

Let us hear what reasons the Reverend author of this seventh Essay is able to produce in support
of his favourite opinion. He approaches the subject from a respectful distance:--

(i) "It is a strange, though familiar fact,"--(such are the opening words of his Essay,)--"that
great differences of opinion exist respecting the Interpretation of Scripture." (p. 330.)--'Familiar,'
the fact is, certainly; but why 'strange?' A Book of many ages,--of immense antiquity,--of
most varied character,--treating of the unseen world,--purporting to be a mysterious composition,--and
by all Christian men believed to have GOD for its true Author: a book which has come into collision
with every form of human error, and has triumphed gloriously over every form of human opposition:--how
can it be thought 'strange' that the interpretation of such a book should have provoked "great
differences of opinion?" ... Surely none but the weakest of thinkers, unless committed to the
assumption that the Bible is like any other book, could ever have penned such a silly remark.

(ii) "We do not at once see the absurdity of the same words having many senses, or free our
minds from the illusion that the Apostle or Evangelist must have written with a reference to
the creeds or controversies or circumstances of other times. Let it be considered, then, that
this extreme variety of interpretation is found to exist in the case of no other book, but
of the Scriptures only." (p. 334.)

But the "phenomenon" which Mr. Jowett represents as "so extraordinary that it requires an effort
of thought to appreciate it," (Ibid.,) does not seem at all extraordinary to any one who does
not begin by assuming that the Bible is "like any other book."--If the Bible be inspired,--then
all is plain!

(iii) "Who would write a bulky treatise about the method to be pursued in interpreting Plato
or Sophocles?"--asks Mr. Jowett. (p. 378.)--No one but a fool!--is the obvious reply. Plato
and Sophocles are ordinary books; and therefore are to be interpreted like any other book.
The Bible not so, as we shall see by and by. Again,--

(iv) "Each writer, each successive age, has characteristics of its own, as strongly marked,
or more strongly, than those which are found in the authors or periods of classical Literature.
These differences are not to be lost in the idea of a Spirit from whom they proceed, or by
which they were overruled. And therefore, illustration of one part of Scripture by another
should be confined to writings of the same age and the same authors, except where the writings
of different ages or persons offer obvious similarities. It may be said, further, that illustration
should be chiefly derived, not only from the same author, but from the same writing, or from
one of the same period of his life. For example, the comparison of St. John and the 'synoptic'
Gospels, or of the Gospel of St. John with the Revelation of St. John, will tend rather to
confuse than to elucidate the meaning of either." (pp. 382-3.)--But really, in reply, it ought
to suffice to point out that the result of the Church's experience for 1800 years has been
the very opposite of the Professor's. "The idea of a SPIRIT from whom they proceeded," is,
to the thoughtful part of mankind, the only intelligible clue to the several books of Holy
Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation! Hence "the marginal references to the English Bible,"
(to which Mr. Jowett devotes a depreciatory half page,) so far from being the dangerous or
useless apparatus which he represents, we hold to be an instrument of paramount importance
for eliciting the true meaning of Holy Writ.--In a word, he is reasoning about the Bible on
the assumption that the Bible is like any other book.

(v) "To attribute to St. Paul or the Twelve the abstract notion of Christian Truth which afterwards
sprang up in the Catholic Church ... is the same error as to attribute to Homer the ideas of
Thales or Heraclitus, or to Thales the more developed principles of Aristotle and Plato." (p.
354.)--Not if St. Paul and the Twelve were inspired.

(vi) He bids us remark, with tedious emphasis, that although the same philological and historical
difficulties which occur in Holy Scripture are found in profane writings, yet "the meaning
of classical authors is known with comparative certainty; and the interpretation of them seems
to rest on a scientific basis.... Even the Vedas and the Zendavesta, though beset by obscurities
of language probably greater than are found in any portion of the Bible, are interpreted, at
least by European scholars, according to fixed rules, and beginning to be clearly understood."
(p. 335.)

But at the end of several weak sentences, through which the preceding fallacy is elongated
into distressing tenuity, who does not exclaim,--The supposed "scientific" basis on which the
interpretation of books in general rests, is simply this; (=1=) that being merely human, and
(=2=) not professing to have any other than their obvious literal meaning,--they are all interpreted
in the obvious ordinary way!

For (=1=),--If any book were even suspected to be Divine, the manner of interpreting it would
of course be different. Not that the "basis" of such Interpretation would therefore cease to
be "scientific!" Take the only known instance of such a Book. The Bible has been suspected
(!) for 1800 years to be inspired. How has it fared with the Bible?

The Science of Biblical Interpretation is one of the noblest and best understood in the world.
It has been professed and practised in every country of Christendom. The great Masters of this
Science have been such men as Hilary of Poictiers, Basil and the two Gregories in Asia Minor,
Epiphanius in Cyprus, Ambrose at Milan, John Chrysostom at Antioch, Jerome in Palestine, Augustine
in Africa, Athanasius and Cyril at Alexandria. The names descend in an unbroken stream from
the first four centuries of our æra down to the age of Andrewes, and Bull, and Pearson, and
Mill. These men all interpret Scripture in one and the same way. Their principles are the same
throughout. They were all Professors of the same Sacred Science.

But (=2=),--If a book even professes to have a hidden meaning, it is interpreted by a special
set of canons. Thus Dante's great poem[146] may not be read as Hume's History of England is
read.--To proceed, however.

(vii) Sophocles is perhaps the most subtle of the ancient Greek poets. "Several schools of
critics have commented on his works. To the Englishman he has presented one meaning, to the
Frenchman another, to the German a third; the interpretations have also differed with the philosophical
systems which the interpreters espoused. To one the same words have appeared to bear a moral,
to another a symbolical meaning; a third is determined wholly by the authority of old commentators;
while there is a disposition to condemn the scholar who seeks to interpret Sophocles from himself
only and with reference to the ideas and beliefs of the age in which he lived. And the error
of such an one is attributed not only to some intellectual but even to a moral obliquity (!)
which prevents his seeing the true meaning." (p. 336.)

It has fared with Sophocles therefore, (according to Mr. Jowett,) in all respects as it has
fared with the Bible. "It would be tedious," (he justly remarks,) "to follow the absurdity
which has been supposed into details. By such methods," Sophocles or Plato might "be made to
mean anything." (p. 336.)

But who does not perceive that the obvious way to escape from the supposed difficulty, is to
remember that neither Sophocles nor Plato was inspired!... Mr. Jowett's difficulty is occasioned
by his assumption that the Bible stands on the same level as Plato and Sophocles.

(viii) Again,--"If it is not held to be a thing impossible that there should be agreement in
the meaning of Plato and Sophocles, neither is it to be regarded as absurd, that there should
be a like agreement in the interpretation of Scripture?" (p. 426.)--The whole force of this
argument clearly consisting in the strictly equal claims of these books to Inspiration.--Elsewhere,
Mr. Jowett expresses the same thing more unequivocally:--The old "explanations of Scripture,"
(he says,) "are no longer tenable. They belong to a way of thinking and speaking which was
once diffused over the world, but has now passed away." Having quietly assumed all this, the
Reverend writer proceeds:--"And what we give up as a general principle, we shall find it impossible
to maintain partially; e.g. in the types of the Mosaic Law, and the double meanings of Prophecy,
at least in any sense in which it is not equally applicable to all deep and suggestive writings."
(p. 419.)

(ix) "Still one other supposition has to be introduced, which will appear, perhaps, more extravagant
than any which have preceded. Conceive then that these modes of interpreting Sophocles (!)
had existed for ages; that great institutions and interests had become interwoven with them;
and in some degree even the honour of Nations and Churches;--is it too much to say that, in
such a case, they would be changed with difficulty, and that they would continue to be maintained
long after critics and philosophers had seen that they were indefensible?" (pp. 336-7.)

I suppose we may at once allow Mr. Jowett most of what he asks. (p. 336;)--if, I repeat, all
this had really and actually taken place;--great "difficulty" would, no doubt, (as Mr. Jowett
profoundly suggests,) be experienced, at the end of 2000 years, in getting rid of them.

But since it unfortunately happens that they have done nothing of the kind, we do not seem
to be called upon to follow the Regius Professor of Greek into the supposed consequences of
what he admits to be an "extravagant supposition;" and which we humbly think is an excessively
foolish one also.

When, however, the Reverend Author of this speculation establishes it as a parallel with what
has taken place with regard to the Word of GOD, we tell him plainly that his insinuation that
"critics and philosophers are maintaining the present mode of interpreting Scripture long after
they have seen that it is indefensible"--is a piece of impertinence which seems to require
a public apology. A man may retain Orders in the Church of England, if he pleases, while yet
he repudiates her doctrines: may declare that he subscribes her Articles ex animo, and yet
seem openly to deny them. But he has no right whatever to impute corresponding baseness to
others. The charge should be either plainly made out, or openly retracted[147].

By such considerations then does Professor Jowett attempt to shew that we ought to "interpret
Scripture like any other book." The gist of his observations, in every case, is one and the
same,--namely, from à priori considerations to insinuate that the Bible is not essentially
unlike any other book.

Now, quite apart from its Inspiration,--which is, obviously, THE one essential respect wherein
the Bible is wholly unlike every other book in the world; (inasmuch as, if it is inspired,
it differs from every other book in kind; stands among Books as the Incarnate WORD stood among
Men,--quite alone; notwithstanding that He spoke their language, shared their wants, and accommodated
Himself to their manners;)--apart, I say, from the fact of its Inspiration, it is not difficult
to point out several particulars in which the Bible is utterly unlike any other Book which
is known to exist; and therefore to suggest an à priori reason why neither should it be interpreted
like any other book.

1. The Bible then contains in all (66-9=) 57 distinct writings,--the work of perhaps upwards
of forty different Authors[148]. Yet, for upwards of fifteen centuries those many writings
have been all collected into one volume: and, for a large portion of that interval, on the
writings so collected the Church Universal has agreed in bestowing the name of the Book,--κατ'
ἐξοχήν,--THE BIBLE.

2. The Bible is divided into two parts, which are severed by an interval of upwards of four
centuries. On these two great divisions of the Bible, respectively, has been bestowed the title
of the Old and the New Covenant. And, what is remarkable,--The same phenomena which are observable
in respect of the whole Bible, are observable in respect of either of its parts. Thus,

(=1=) The several writings of which the Old Testament is composed,--(39-3=) 36 in all[149],
are by many different hands: those of the New Testament, in like manner,--(27-6=) 21 in all,
are by eight different authors.

(=2=) Those many writings of the Old Testament are found to have been collected into a single
volume about four hundred years before the Christian æra; when they were denominated by a common
name, ἡ γραφή,--"The Scripture[150];" and the supreme authority of the writings so collected
together, was axiomatic[151]. One arguing with His Hebrew countrymen was able to appeal to
a place in the Psalms, and to remind them parenthetically that "the Scripture cannot be broken[152],"--that
is, might not be gainsaid, doubted, explained away, or set aside.--Precisely similar phenomena
are observable in respect of the writings of the New Testament.

(=3=) Although the books of the Old Covenant are scattered at intervals over the long period
of upwards of a thousand years, the writers of the later books are observed to quote the earlier
ones, as if by a peculiar secret sympathy: now, incorporating long passages,--now, simply adapting
one or two sentences,--now, blending allusive references. For some proof of this assertion,
(as far as I am able to produce it at a moment's notice,) the reader is referred to the foot
of the page[153].

The self-same phenomenon is observable with regard to the New Testament Scriptures. Although
all the books were written within so short a space as about fifty years, the later writers
quote the earlier ones to a surprising extent. In the Gospels, the Gospels are quoted times
without number. In the Epistles, the Gospels are cited, or referred to, upwards of sixty times.
The Epistles contain many references to the Epistles.--The phenomenon thus alluded to will
also be found insisted upon in a later part of the present volume[154].

"The fact, I believe, on close examination, will be found to stand thus:--The Holy Bible abounds
in quotations, even more perhaps than most other books; but they are introduced in a way which
is peculiar to Revelation, and its own. When a Prophet or Apostle mentions one of his own holy
brethren, as when Ezekiel names Daniel, or Daniel Jeremiah; when St. Peter speaks of St. Paul,
or St. Paul of St. Peter, or of St. Luke the Physician; when they mention them, they do not
quote them; and when they quote them, they do not mention them[155]."

(=4=) The later writer in the Old Testament who quotes some earlier portion of narrative is
often observed to supply independent information,--entering into minute details and particulars
which are not to be found in the earlier record.--Now, "with the same Almighty SPIRIT for their
guide, what was it to be expected that the historians of our Blessed LORD would do? What, but
the very thing which they have done? that they would walk in the path, which the holy Prophets
of old had marked out? that they would often tread full in each other's steps; often relate
the same miracle, or discourse, or parts of it, in the words of the same prior writer; sometimes
compress, sometimes expand; always shew to the diligent inquirer, that they did not derive
their information, even of facts which they relate in another's words, from him whom they copy,
but wrote with antecedent plenitude of knowledge and truth in themselves; without staying to
inform us whether what they deliver is told for the first time, or has its place already in
authentic history[156]."

(=5=) It may be worth remarking that though the Inspiration of no part of either Testament
has ever been doubted in the Church, there do exist doubts as to the Authorship of more than
one of the Books of the Old Testament; and one Book in the New, (the Epistle to the Hebrews,)
has been suspected by some orthodox writers not to have been from the pen of St. Paul, but
to have been the work of some other inspired and Apostolic writer.

(=6=) History, Didactic matter, and Prophecy,--is found to be the subject of either Testament.

(=7=) In the New Testament, as in the Old, we are presented with the singular phenomenon of
more than one Book being in a manner copied from another,--yet with the addition of much independent
original matter. It is superfluous to name Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, on one side,--and
the Gospels on the other. To the Gospels may be added the Second Epistle of St. Peter and the
Epistle of St. Jude.

(=8=) Lastly, the same modest use of the Supernatural is to be found in either Testament.--In
both, the writers are observed to pass without effort, and as it were unconsciously, from revelations
of the most stupendous character, to statements of the simplest and most ordinary kind[157].--In
both, there is the same prominence given to individual characters[158]; the same occasional
minuteness of detail where it might have been least expected[159].

3. But by far the most remarkable phenomenon remains to be noticed; namely, the immense number
of quotations, (so far more numerous than is commonly suspected,)--extending in length from
a single word to nearly a hundred and fifty[160],--together with allusive references, literally
without number, which are found in the New Testament Scriptures; the writings of the elder
Covenant being in every instance, exclusively[161], the source of those quotations,--the object
of those allusions.

4. When the nature of these quotations, references, and allusions is examined with care, several
extraordinary phenomena present themselves, which it seems impossible to consider without the
deepest interest, surprise, and admiration. Thus,--(i.) The New Testament writers, on repeated
occasions, display independent knowledge of the Old Testament History to which they make reference[162].
The following instances occur to my memory:--All the later links in our LORD'S Genealogy[163];
the second Cainan[164]: Salmon's marriage with Rahab[165]: the burial-place of the twelve Patriarchs[166]:
the age of Moses in Exod. ii. 11[167]: that in the days of Elijah the heaven was shut up for
three years and six months[68]: that it was the Devil who tempted Eve[169]: the contest for
the dead body of Moses[170]: the names of Pharaoh's magicians[171]: how Abraham reasoned with
himself when he prepared to offer up his son Isaac[172]: the golden censer, mentioned in Heb.
ix. 4: Abraham's purchase of Sychem[173]; and a few other things[174].

(ii.) The same New Testament writers are observed to handle the Old Testament Scriptures with
an air of singular authority, and to exercise an extraordinary license of quotation; inverting
clauses,--paraphrasing statements,--abridging or expanding;--and always without apology or
explanation;--as if they were conscious that they were dealing with their own.

(iii.) Most astonishing of all, obviously, as well as most important, is the purpose for which
the Evangelists and Apostles of our LORD make their appeal to the Old Testament Scriptures;
invariably in order to establish some part of the Christian Revelation. "Every thoughtful student
of the Holy Scriptures has been struck with the circumstance which I now allude to: the freedom,
namely, with which the inspired Writers of the New Testament appeal back to the Old; and see
in it, as its one proper theme, the Christian subject. They find themselves in that place,
at length, to which former intimations had pointed, and recognize the connexion which they
themselves have with their ancient forerunners[175]." ... It is as if for four hundred years
and upwards, a mighty mystery,--described in many a dark place of Prophecy, exhibited by many
a perplexing type, foreshadowed by many a Divine narrative,--had waited for solution. The world
is big with expectation. The long-expected time at last arrives. Up springs the Sun of Righteousness
in the Heavens; and lo, the cryptic characters of the Law flash at once into glory, and the
dark Oracles of ancient days yield up their wondrous meanings! ... Such is the relation which
the New Testament bears to the Old: such the true nature of the many quotations from the earlier
Scriptures, which are found in the later half of the One inspired Volume.

5. And thus we are led naturally to notice the extraordinary connexion which subsists between
the two Testaments. "For what is the Law," (asks Justin, A.D. 140,) "but the Gospel foretold?
or what is the Gospel, but the Law fulfilled[176]?" "The contents of the Old and New Testament
are the same," remarks Augustine: "there foreshadowed, here revealed: there prefigured, here
made plain." "In the Old Testament there is a concealing of the New: in the New Testament there
is a revealing of the Old[177]."--Mr. Jowett's inquiry,--"If we assume the New Testament as
a tradition running parallel with the Old, may not the Roman Catholic assume with equal reason
a tradition parallel with the New?" (p. 81.)--shews a truly childish misapprehension of the
entire question. The New Testament is not a "parallel tradition" at all; but a subsequent Revelation
from Heaven.

6. Now I might pursue these remarks much further: for it would be well worth while to exhibit
what an extraordinary sameness of imagery, similarity of allusion, and unity of purpose, runs
through the writings of either Covenant;--phenomena which can only be accounted for in one
way. This subject will be found dwelt upon elsewhere; and to what has been already delivered,
I must be content here to refer the reader[178].

(Mr. Jowett himself has been struck by the phenomenon thus alluded to: but after hinting at
"some natural association" as having suggested the language of the Prophets, he proceeds: "We
are not therefore justified in supposing any hidden connexion in the prophecies where [the
prophetic symbols] occur. Neither is there any other ground for assuming design of any other
kind in Scripture; any more than in Plato or Homer." (p. 381.) ... And thus our philosopher,
assuming at the outset that the Bible is an uninspired book, is for ever coming back to the
lie with which he set out. But to proceed.)

7. Still better worthy of notice, in this connexion, is the singular fact (which will also
be found adverted to in another place[179],) that the Old and New Testaments alike profess
to be a History of Earthly events from a Heavenly point of view. The writers of either Covenant
claim to know what GOD did[180]; how characters and events appeared in His sight[181]: they
profess to find themselves in a familiar, and altogether extraordinary relation with the unseen
world[182]. ... "The general design of Scripture," (says Bishop Butler,) "may be said to be,
to give us an account of the World, in this one single view,--as GOD'S World: by which it appears
essentially distinguished from all other books, as far as I have found, except such as are
copied from it[184]."

8. And yet the grand external characteristic feature of the Bible remains unnoticed! The one
distinctive feature of the Bible, is this,--that the four-fold Gospel, as a matter of fact,
exhibits to us, the WORD "made flesh:" and, (O marvel of marvels!) suffers us to hear His voice,
and look upon His form, and observe His actions. It does more. The New Testament professes
to be, and is, the complement of the Old. The promise of CHRIST, solemnly, and repeatedly,--"at
sundry times and divers manners,"--given in the one, is fulfilled in the other. Henceforth
they are no more twain, for they have been by GOD Himself joined together; and the subject
of both is none other than our SAVIOUR, JESUS CHRIST.

Enough surely has been already adduced to warrant a reasonable man in refusing to accept Professor
Jowett's repeated asseveration that the Bible is "to be interpreted like any other book." A
Book which proves on examination to be so wholly unlike every other book,--so entirely sui
generis,--may surely well create an à priori suspicion that it is not to be interpreted either,
after any ordinary fashion. But the grand consideration of all is still behind! The one circumstance
which effectually refutes the view of the Reverend Professor, remains yet to be specified;
namely, that THE BIBLE PROFESSES TO BE INSPIRED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. The HOLY GHOST is again
and again declared to speak therein, διά, "by the instrumentality," "by the mouth," of Man.
In other words, GOD, not Man, professes to be the Author of the Bible!

That the Bible does set up for itself such a claim, will be found established at p. 53 to p.
57 of the present volume. Professor Jowett's assurance that "for any of the higher or supernatural
views of Inspiration, there is no foundation in the Gospels or Epistles," (p. 345,)--must therefore
be regarded as an extraordinary, or rather as an unpardonable oversight on his part. One would
have thought that a single saying, like that in Acts iii. 18 and 21, would have occurred to
his memory, and been sufficient to refute him. Other places will be found quoted at p. cxcvii.

Very much is it to be feared however that the same gentleman has overlooked a consideration
of at least equal importance; namely, the inevitable inference from the discovery that the
origin of the Bible is Divine. He informs us that,--"It will be a further assistance (!) in
the consideration of this subject, to observe that the Interpretation of Scripture has nothing
to do with any opinion respecting its origin." (p. 350.) "The meaning of Scripture," (he proceeds,)
"is one thing: the Inspiration of Scripture is another."--True. But when we find the Reverend
Author insisting, again and again, that "it may be laid down that Scripture has one meaning,--the
meaning which it had to the mind of the Prophet or Evangelist who first uttered, or wrote it,"
(p. 378,)--we are constrained to remind him that, "To say that the Scriptures, and the things
contained in them, can have no other or farther meaning than those persons thought or had,
who first recited or wrote them; is evidently saying, that those persons were the original,
proper, and sole authors of those books, i.e. THAT THEY ARE NOT INSPIRED[185]." So that, in
point of fact, the origin of Holy Scripture, so far from being a consideration of no importance,
(as Mr. Jowett supposes,) proves to be a consideration of the most vital importance of all.
And the Interpretation of Scripture, so far from having "nothing to do with any opinion respecting
its origin," is affected by it most materially, or rather depends upon it altogether!

On a review of all that goes before, it will, I think, appear plain to any person of sound
understanding, that Professor Jowett's à priori views respecting the Interpretation of Holy
Scripture will not stand the test of exact reason. To suggest as he has done that the Bible
is to be interpreted like any other book, on the plea that it is like any other book, is to
build upon a false foundation. His syllogism is the following:--

     If the Bible is a book like any other book, the Bible is to be
     interpreted like any other book.

     The Bible is a book like any other book.

      Therefore,--

But it has been shewn that the learned Professor's minor premiss is false. It has been proved
that the Bible is NOT a book like any other book.

Nay, I claim to have done more. I claim to have established the contradictory minor premiss.
The syllogism therefore will henceforth stand as follows:--

     If the Bible can be shewn to be a book like no other book, but
     entirely sui generis, and claiming to be the work of
     Inspiration,--then is it reasonable to expect that it will have to
     be interpreted like no other book, but entirely after a fashion of
     its own.

      Therefore,--

$2.$ It remains however, now, to advance an important step.--Mr. Jowett, in a certain place,
adopts a principle, the soundness of which I am able, happily, entirely to admit. "Interpret
Scripture from itself,--like any other book about which we know almost nothing except what
is derived from its pages." (p. 382.) "Non nisi ex Scripturâ Scripturam interpretari potes."
(p. 384.)

Scarcely has he made this important admission however, and enunciated his golden Canon of interpretation,
when he hastens to nullify it. His very next words are,--"The meaning of the Canon is only
this,--'That we cannot understand Scripture without becoming familiar (!) with it.'"

But, (begging the learned writer's pardon,) so far from that being the whole of the meaning
of the Canon, his gloss happens exactly to miss the only important point. The plain meaning
of the words,--"Only out of the Scriptures can you explain the Scriptures,"--is obviously rather
this:--'That in order to interpret the Bible, our aim must be to ascertain how the Bible interprets
itself.' In other words,--'Scripture must be made its own Interpreter.' More simply yet, in
the Professor's own words, (from which, more suo, he has imperceptibly glided away,)--"Interpret
Scripture from itself." (p. 382.) ... How then does Scripture interpret Scripture? That is
the only question! for the answer to this question must be held to be decisive as to the other
great question which Mr. Jowett raises in the present Essay,--namely, How are we to interpret
Scripture?

Now this whole Inquiry has been conducted elsewhere; and will be found to extend from p. 144
to p. 160 of the present volume. It has been there established, by a sufficiently large induction
of examples, that the Bible is to be interpreted as no other book is, or can be interpreted;
and for the plain reason, that the inspired Writers themselves, (our LORD Himself at their
head!) interpret it after an altogether extraordinary fashion. Mr. Jowett's statement at p.
339 that "the mystical interpretation of Scripture originated in the Alexandrian age," is simply
false.

And in the course of this proof, (necessarily involved in it, in fact,) it has been incidentally
shewn that the sense of Scripture is not, by any means, invariably one; and that sense the
most obvious to those who wrote, heard, or read it. It has been fully shewn that the office
of the Interpreter is not, by any means, (as Mr. Jowett imagines,) "to recover the meaning
of the words as they first struck on the ears, or flashed before the eyes of those who heard
or read them." (p. 338.) The Reverend writer's repeated assertion that "we have no reason to
attribute to the Prophet or Evangelist any second or hidden sense different from that which
appears on the surface," (p. 380,) has been fully, and as it is hoped effectually refuted.

And here I might lay down my pen. For since, at the end of 74 pages, the Professor thus delivers
himself, (in a kind of imitation of St. Paul's language[186],)--"Of what has been said, this
is the sum,--That Scripture, like other books, has one meaning, which has to be gathered from
itself ... without regard to à priori notions about its nature and origin:" that, "It is to
be interpreted like other books, with attention to the prevailing state of civilization and
knowledge," and so forth; (p. 404;)--it must suffice to say that, having established the very
opposite conclusion, I claim to have effectually answered his Essay; because I have overthrown
what he admits to be "the sum" of it. Let me be permitted however--before I proceed to review
some other parts of his performance,--in the briefest manner, not so much to recapitulate,
as to exhibit 'the sum' of what has been hitherto delivered on the other side; in somewhat
different language, and as it were from a different point of view.

We are presented then, in the New Testament Scriptures, with the august spectacle of the Ancient
of Days holding the entire volume of the Old Testament Scriptures in His Hands, and interpreting
it of Himself. He, whose Life and Death are set forth in the Gospel;--whose Church's early
fortunes are set forth historically in the Acts, while its future prospects are shadowed prophetically
in the Apocalypse;--whose Doctrines, lastly, are explained in the twenty-one Epistles of St.
Paul and St. Peter, St. James and St. John and St. Jude:--He, the Incarnate WORD, who was "in
the beginning;" who "was with GOD," and who "was GOD:"--that same Almighty One, I repeat, is
exhibited to us in the Gospel, repeatedly, holding the Volume of the Old Testament Scriptures
in His Hands, and explaining it of Himself. "To day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears[187],"--was
the solemn introductory sentence with which, in the Synagogue of Nazareth, (after closing the
Book and giving it again to the Minister,) He prefaced His Sermon from the lxist chapter of
Isaiah.--"Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me: for he wrote of Me[188],"--"'O
fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!

"CHRIST was before Moses. The Gospel was not made for the Law; but the Law was made for the
Gospel. The Gospel is not based on the Law, but the Law is a shadow of the Gospel. In order
to believe the Bible, we must look upward; and fix our eyes on JESUS CHRIST, sitting in Heavenly
Glory, holding both Testaments in His Hand; sealing both Testaments with His seal; and delivering
both Testaments as Divine Oracles, to the World. We must receive the written Word from the
Hands of the INCARNATE WORD[191]."

This august spectacle, let it be clearly stated,--(1) Establishes, beyond all power of contradiction,
the intimate connexion which subsists between the Old and the New Testament; as well as the
altogether unique relation which the one bears to the other:--(2) Invests either Testament
with a degree of sacred importance and majestic grandeur which altogether makes the Bible unlike
"any other book:"--(3) Proves that the Bible is to be interpreted as no other book ever was,
or ever can be interpreted:--(4) Demonstrates that it has more than a single meaning:--and
lastly, Convincingly shews that GOD, and not Man, is its true Author.

It will of course be asked,--Then does Mr. Jowett take no notice at all of this vast and complicated
problem? How does he treat of the relation between the Old Testament and the New?... He despatches
the entire subject in the following passage:--"The question," (he says,) "runs up into a more
general one, 'the relation between the Old and New Testaments.' For the Old Testament will
receive a different meaning accordingly as it is explained from itself, or from the New." (Very
different certainly!) "In the first case,--a careful and conscientious study of each one for
itself is all that is required." (That is to say, it will not be explained at all!) "In the
second case,--the types and ceremonies of the Law, perhaps the very facts and persons of the
history, WILL BE ASSUMED (!) to be predestined or made after a pattern corresponding to the
things that were to be in the latter days." (p. 370.) (And why not "will be found to be replete
with Christian meaning,--full of lofty spiritual significancy?"--the proved marvellousness
of their texture, the revealed mysteriousness of their purpose, being an effectual refutation
of all Mr. Jowett's à priori notions!)

"And this question," (he proceeds,) "stirs up another question respecting the Interpretation
of the Old Testament in the New. Is such Interpretation to be regarded as the meaning of the
original text, or an accommodation of it to the thoughts of other times?" (Nay, but Reverend
and learned Sir: "nothing so plain," as you justly observe, "that it may not be explained away;"
(p. 359;) yet we cannot consent to have the sense of plain words thus clouded over at your
mere bidding. It is now our turn to declare that the Interpreter's "object is to read Scripture
like any other book, with a real interest and not merely a conventional one." It is now we
who "want to be able to open our eyes, and see things as they truly are." (p. 338.) We simply
petition for leave to "interpret Scripture like any other book, by the same rules of evidence
and the same canons of criticism." (p. 375.) And if this freedom be but conceded to us, there
will be found to be no imaginable reason why the Interpretation of the Old Testament in the
New,--(CHRIST Himself being the Majestic Speaker! our present edification and everlasting welfare
being His gracious purpose!)--should not be strictly "regarded as the meaning of the original
text." ... But let us hear the Professor out:--)

"Our object," (he says, and with this he dismisses the problem!)--"Our object is not to attempt
here the determination of these questions; but to point out that they must be determined before
any real progress can be made, or any agreement arrived at in the Interpretation of Scripture."
(p. 370.) ... They must indeed. But can it be right in this slovenly, slippery style to shirk
a discussion on the issue of which the whole question may be said to turn? especially on the
part of one who scruples not to prejudge that issue, and straightway to apply it, (in a manner
fatal to the Truth,) throughout all his hundred pages. Mr. Jowett's method is ever to assume
what he ought to prove, and then either to be plaintive, or to sneer. "It is a heathenish or
Rabbinical fancy:"--"Such complexity would place the Scriptures below human compositions in
general; for it would deprive them of the ordinary intelligibleness of human language" (p.
382):--&c.

"Is the Interpretation of the Old Testament in the New to be regarded as the meaning of the
original text; or an accommodation of it to the thoughts of other times?" (p. 370.) This is
Mr. Jowett's question; the question which it is "not his object to attempt to determine;" but
which I, on the contrary, have made it my object to discuss in my VIth Sermon,--p. 183 to p.
220. Without troubling the reader however now to wade through those many pages, let me at least
explain to him in a few words what Mr. Jowett's question really amounts to: namely this,--Do
the Apostles and Evangelists, does our Blessed LORD Himself, when He professes to explain the
mysterious significancy of the Old Testament,--invariably,--in every instance,--misrepresent
"the meaning of the original text?" And the answer to this question I am content to await from
any candid person of plain unsophisticated understanding. Is it credible, concerning the Divine
expositions found in St. Matth. xxii. 31, 32,--xxii. 43-5,--xii. 39, 40,--xi. 10,--St. John
viii. 17,18,--i. 52,--vi. 31, &c,--x. 34-5:--the Apostolic interpretations found in 1 Cor.
ix. 9-11,--x. 1-6,--xv. 20,--Heb. ii. 5-9,--vii. 1-10,--Gal. iv. 21-31:--is it conceivable,
I ask, that not one of all these places should exhibit the actual 'meaning of the original
text?' And yet, (as Mr. Jowett himself is forced to admit,)--"If we attribute to the details
of the Mosaical ritual a reference to the New Testament, or suppose the passage of the Red
Sea to be regarded not merely as a figure of Baptism, but as a preordained type;--the principle
is conceded!" (p. 369.) "A little more or a little less of the method does not make the difference."
(Ibid.) In a word,--in such case, Mr. Jowett's Essay falls to the ground!... To proceed however.

$3.$ The case of Interpretation has not yet been fully set before the reader. Hitherto, we
have merely traced the problem back to the fountain-head, and dealt with it simply as a Scriptural
question. We have shewn what light is thrown upon Interpretation by the volume of Inspiration.
The subject has been treated in the same way in the Vth and VIth of my Sermons. But it will
not be improper, in this place,--it is even indispensable,--to develope the problem a little
more fully; and to explain that it is of much larger extent.

Now, there is a family resemblance in the method of all ancient expositions of Holy Scripture
which vindicates for them, however remotely, a common origin. There is a resemblance in the
general way of handling the Inspired Word which can only be satisfactorily explained by supposing
that the remote type of all was the oral teaching of the Apostles themselves. In truth, is
it credible that the early Christians would have been so forgetful of the discourses of the
men who had seen the LORD, that no trace of it,--no tradition of so much as the manner of it,--should
have lingered on for a hundred years after the death of the last of the Apostles; down to the
time when Origen, for example, was a young man?... It cannot possibly be!

(i.) "The things which thou hast heard of me among many witnesses," (writes the great Apostle
to his son Timothy,) "the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others
also[192]." Provision is thus made by the aged Saint,--in the last of his Epistles,--for the
transmission of his inspired teaching[193] to a second and a third generation. Now the words
just quoted were written about the year 65, at which time Timothy was a young man. Unless we
suppose that ALMIGHTY GOD curtailed the lives of the chief depositaries of His Word, Timothy
will have lived on till A.D. 100; so that "faithful men" who died in the middle of the next
century might have been trained and taught by him for many years. It follows, that the "faithful
men" last spoken of will have been "able to teach others also," whose writings (if they wrote
at all) would range from A.D. 190 to A.D. 210. Now, just such a writer is Hippolytus,--who
is known to have been taught by that "faithful man" Irenæus[194],--to whom, as it happens,
the deposit was "committed" by Polycarp,--who stood to St. John in the self-same relation as
Timothy to St. Paul!

(ii.) Our SAVIOUR is repeatedly declared to have interpreted the Old Testament to His Disciples.
For instance, to the two going to Emmaus, "beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He interpreted
to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself[195]." Moreover, before He left
the world, He solemnly promised His Apostles that the HOLY GHOST, whom the FATHER should send
in His Name, "should teach them all things, and bring to their remembrance all things which
He had spoken to them[196]." Shall we believe that the Treasury of Divine Inspiration thus
opened by CHRIST Himself was straightway closed up by its human guardians, and at once forgotten?
Shall we not rather believe that Cleopas and his companion, (for instance,) forthwith repeated
their LORD'S words to every member of the Apostolic body, and to others also; that they were
questioned again and again by adoring listeners, even to their extremest age; aye, and that
they taxed their memories to the utmost in order to recal every little word, every particular
of our SAVIOUR'S Divine utterance? It must be so! And the echo, the remote echo of that exposition,
depend upon it! descended to a second, aye and to a third generation; yea, and has come down,
faintly, and feebly it may be, but yet essentially and truly, even to ourselves!

(iii.) And yet,--(for we would not willingly incur the charge of being fanciful in so solemn
and important a matter,)--the great fact to be borne in mind, (and it is the great fact which
nothing can ever set aside or weaken,) is, that for the first century at least of our æra,
there existed within the Christian Church the gift of Prophecy; that is, of Inspired Interpretation[197].
The minds of the Apostles, CHRIST Himself "opened, to understand the Scriptures[198]." Can
it be any matter of surprise that men so enlightened, when they had been miraculously endowed
with the gift of tongues[199], and scattered over the face of the ancient civilized World,
should have disseminated the same principles of Catholic Interpretation, as well as the same
elements of Saving Truth? When this miraculous gift ceased, its results did not also come to
an end. The fountain dried up, but the streams which it had sent forth yet "made glad the City
of GOD." And by what possible logic can the teaching of the early Church be severed from its
source? It cannot be supposed for an instant that such a severance ever took place. The teaching
of the Apostolic age was the immediate parent of the teaching of the earliest of the Fathers,--in
whose Schools it is matter of history that those Patristic writers with whom we are most familiar,
studied and became famous. Accordingly, we discover a method of Interpreting Holy Scripture
strictly resembling that employed by our SAVIOUR and His Apostles, in all the earliest Patristic
writings. As documents increase, the evidence is multiplied; and at the end of two or three
centuries after the death of St. John the Evangelist, voices are heard from Jerusalem and other
parts of Palestine; from Antioch and from other parts of Syria; from the Eastern and the Western
extremities of North Africa; from many regions of Asia Minor; from Constantinople and from
Greece; from Rome, from Milan, and from other parts of Italy; from Cyprus and from Gaul;--all
singing in unison; all singing the same heavenly song!... In what way but one is so extraordinary
a phenomenon to be accounted for? Are we to believe that there was a general conspiracy of
the East and the West, the North and the South, to interpret Holy Scripture in a certain way;
and that way, the wrong way?

Enough has been said, it is thought, to shew that many of Mr. Jowett's remarks about the value
of Patristic evidence are either futile or incorrect; or that they betray an entire misapprehension
of the whole question, not to say a thorough want of appreciation of the claims of Antiquity.
We do not yield to the 'Essayist and Reviewer' in veneration for the Inspired page; and trust
that enough has been said to shew it. Our eye, when we read Scripture, (like his,) "is fixed
on the form of One like the Son of Man; or of the Prophet who was girded with a garment of
camel's hair; or of the Apostle who had a thorn in the flesh." (p. 338.) We are only unlike
Mr. Jowett we fear in this,--that we believe ex animo that the first-named was the Eternal
SON, "equal to the FATHER," and "of one substance with the FATHER[200]:" and further that St.
Paul's fourteen Epistles are all inspired writings, in an entirely different sense from the
Dialogues of Plato or the Tragedies of Sophocles. It follows, that however riveted our mental
gaze may be on the awful forms which come before us in Holy Scripture,--as often as we con
the inspired record of the actions and of the sayings of those men, we are constrained many
a time to look upward, and to exclaim with the Psalmist, "Thy thoughts are very deep[201]!"
And often if asked, "Understandest thou what thou readest?"--we must still answer with the
Ethiopian, "How can I, except some man should guide me[202]?"

(iv.) To assume however that our defective knowledge "cannot be supplied by the conjectures
of Fathers or Divines," (p. 338,) is in some sort to beg the question at issue. To say of the
student of Scripture that "the history of Christendom, and all the afterthoughts of Theology,
are nothing to him:" (p. 338:) that "he has to imagine himself a disciple of CHRIST or Paul,
and to disengage himself from all that follows:" (Ibid.:) is not the language of modesty, but
of inordinate conceit. In Mr. Jowett it is in fact something infinitely worse; for he shews
that his object thereby is to "obtain an unembarrassed opportunity of applying all the resources
of a so-called criticism to discredit and destroy the written record itself[203]."

"True indeed it is, that more than any other subject of human knowledge, Biblical criticism
has hung (sic.) to the past;" (p. 340;) but the reason is also obvious. It is because, in the
words of great Bishop Pearson, "Philosophia quotidie progressu, Theologia nisi regressu non
crescit[204]." "O ye who are devoting yourselves to the Divine Science of Theology," (he exclaims,)
"and whose cheeks grow pale over the study of Holy Scripture above all; ye who either fill
the venerable office of the Priesthood or intend it, and are hereafter to undertake the awful
cure of souls:--rid yourselves of that itch of the present age, the love of novelty. Make it
your business to inquire for that which was from the beginning. Resort for counsel to the fountain-head.
Have recourse to Antiquity. Return to the holy Fathers. Look back to the primitive Church.
In the words of the Prophet,--'Ask for the old paths[205].'"

When therefore Mr. Jowett classes together "the early Fathers, the Roman Catholic mystical
writers, the Swiss and German Reformers, and the Nonconformist Divines," (p. 377,)--he either
shews a most lamentable want of intellectual perspective, or a most perverse understanding.
So jumbled into one confused heap, it may not be altogether untrue to say of Commentators generally,
that "the words of Scripture suggest to them their own thoughts or feelings." (p. 377.) But
when it is straightway added, "There is nothing in such a view derogatory to the Saints and
Doctors of former ages," (Ibid.,) we are constrained, (for the reasons already before the reader,)
to remonstrate against so misleading and deceitful a way of putting the case. Mr. Jowett desires
to be understood not to depreciate "the genius or learning of famous men of old," when he remarks
"that Aquinas or Bernard did not shake themselves free from the mystical method of the Patristic
times." (Ibid.) But with singular obtuseness, or with pitiful disingenuousness, he does his
best by such words to shut out from view the real question at issue,--namely, the exegetical
value of Patristic Antiquity. For the Church of England, when she appeals, (as she repeatedly
does,) to "the Ancient Fathers," does not by any means intend such names as the Abbot of Clairvaux,
who flourished in the middle of the twelfth century; or Thomas of Aquinum, who lived later
into the thirteenth. It is the spirit of the ante-Nicene age which she defers to; the Fathers
of the first four or five centuries to whose opinion she gives reverent attention; as her formularies
abundantly shew. The point to be observed is that the Writers of the Patristic times, as a
matter of fact, "did not shake themselves free from the mystical method of" CHRIST and His
Apostles!

Very far am I from denying that "any one who, instead of burying himself in the pages of the
commentators, would learn the Sacred Writings by heart, and paraphrase them in English, will
probably make a nearer approach to their true meaning than he would gather from any Commentary."
Quite certain is it that "the true use of Interpretation is to get rid of interpretation, and
leave us alone in company with the author." (p. 384.) But this is quite a distinct and different
matter, as every person of unsophisticated understanding must perceive at once. The same thing
will be found stated by myself, in a subsequent part of the present volume, at considerable
length[206]; the qualifying condition having been introduced at p. 16. The truth is, a man
can no more divest himself of the conditions of thought habitual to one familiar with his Prayer-Book,
than he can withdraw himself from the atmosphere of light in which he moves. Not the abuse
of Commentators on Holy Scripture, but the principle on which Holy Scripture itself is to be
interpreted,--is the real question at issue: the fundamental question which underlies this,
being of course the vital one,--namely, Is the Bible an inspired book, or not?

Apart from what has been already urged concerning "the torrent of Patristic Interpretation[207]"
which flows down not so much from the fountain-head of Scripture, (wherein so many specimens
of Inspired Interpretation are preserved,) as from the fontal source of all Wisdom and Knowledge,--even
the lips of the Incarnate WORD Himself;--apart from this, a very important Historical circumstance
calls for notice in this place.

How did Christianity originate? how did it first establish a footing in the world? "The answer
is, By the preaching of living men, who said they were commissioned by GOD to proclaim it.
That was the origin and first establishment of Christianity. There is indeed a vague and unreasoning
notion prevalent that Christianity was taken from the New Testament. The notion is historically
untrue. Christianity was widely extended through the civilized world before the New Testament
was written; and its several books were successively addressed to various bodies of Christian
believers; to bodies, that is, who already possessed the faith of CHRIST in its integrity.
When, indeed, GOD ceased to inspire persons to write these books, and when they were all collected
together into what we call the New Testament, the existing Faith of the Church, derived from
oral teaching, was tested by comparison with this Inspired Record. And it henceforth became
the standing law of the Church that nothing should be received as necessary to Salvation, which
could not stand that test. But still, though thus tested, (every article being proved by the
New Testament,) Christianity is not taken from it; for it existed before it.

"What, then, was the Christianity which was thus established? Have we any record of it as it
existed before the New Testament became the sole authoritative standard? I answer, we have.
The Creeds of the Christian Church are the record of it. That is precisely what they purport
to be: not documents taken from the New Testament, but documents transmitting to us the Faith
as it was held from the beginning; the Faith as it was preached by inspired men, before the
inspired men put forth any writings; the Faith once for all delivered to the Saints. Accordingly
you will find that our Church in her viiith Article does not ground her affirmation that the
Creeds ought to be 'thoroughly received and believed,' on the fact that they were taken from
the New Testament, (which they were not;) but on the fact that 'they may be proved by most
certain warrants of Holy Scripture.'"

It follows therefore from what has been said, that even if bad men could succeed in destroying
the authority of the Bible as the Word of GOD, all could not be up with Christianity. There
would still remain to be dealt with the Faith as it exists in the world; the Faith held from
the beginning; the Faith once delivered to the Saints. None of the assaults on Holy Scripture
can touch that; for it traces itself to an independent origin. The evil work, therefore, would
have to be begun all over again. The special doctrines which are impugned in 'Essays and Reviews'
do not stand or fall with the Inspiration or Interpretation of Scripture; but are stereotyped
in the Faith of Christendom. "The Fall of Man, Original Sin, the Atonement, the Divinity of
CHRIST, the Trinity, all have their place in the Faith held from the beginning. They are imbedded
in the Creeds, and in that general scheme of Doctrine which circles round the Creeds, and is
involved in them. Nay, curiously enough,--or rather I should say providentially,--the very
point against which the attacks of this book are principally directed, namely the Inspiration
of the Old Testament, is in express terms asserted there:--the HOLY GHOST 'spake by the Prophets[208].'"

It remains to shew the bearing of these remarks on Mr. Jowett's Essay.--With infinite perseverance,
he dwells upon "the nude Scripture, the merest letter of the Sacred Volume, as if in it and
in it alone, resided the entire Revelation of CHRIST, and all possible means of judging what
that Revelation consists of: whereas this is very far indeed from being the case. Every single
Book of the New Testament was written, as we have seen, to persons already in possession of
Christian Truth. It is quite erroneous therefore, historically and notoriously erroneous, to
suppose either that the Divine Institution of the Church, or that its Doctrines, were literally
founded upon the written words of Holy Scripture; or that they can impart no illustration nor
help in the Interpretation of those written words.... The complete possession of the saving
Truth belonged to the Christian Church not by degrees, nor in lapse of time, but from the first.
Of that saving truth, thus taught and thus possessed, the Apostles' Creed, growing up as it
did on every side of Christendom as the faithful record of the uniform oral teaching of the
Apostles, is the true and precious historical monument[209]; and I venture to say that if any
person claims to reject the Apostles' Creed as an auxiliary, a great and invaluable auxiliary,
in interpreting the writings of the Apostles, he shews himself to be very wanting indeed in
appreciation of the comparative value of Historical Evidence, and of the true principles of
Historical Philosophy.--And not the Apostles' Creed only; but the whole history and tradition
of the universal Church,--needing, no doubt, skill and discretion in its application,--supply,
when applied with requisite skill and discretion, very valuable and real aid in interpreting
Holy Scripture[210]."

When therefore Mr. Jowett speaks contemptuously of "the attempt to adapt the truths of Scripture
to the doctrines of the Creeds," (p. 353,) the kindest thing which can be said is that he writes
like an ignorant, or at least an unlearned man. "The Creeds" (he says) "are acknowledged to
be a part of Christianity.... Yet it does not follow that they should be pressed into the service
of the Interpreter." Why not? we ask. "The growth of ideas," (he replies,) "in the interval
which separated the first century from the fourth or sixth makes it impossible to apply the
language of the one to the explanation of the other. Between Scripture and the Nicene or Athanasian
Creeds, a world of the understanding comes in; and mankind are no longer at the same point
as when the whole of Christianity was contained in the words 'Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST
and thou mayest be saved;' when the Gospel centred in the attachment to a living and recently
departed friend and Lord." (p. 353.)

But there is a fallacy or a falsity at every step of this argument. For when did the Gospel
ever "centre in attachment?" or when was "the whole of Christianity contained" in one short
sentence? Supposing too that "a world of the understanding" does come in between the first
century and the sixth; how does it follow that it is "impossible" to apply the language of
the Creeds to the interpretation of Holy Scripture? Explain to me how that "world of understanding"
affects the Nicene Creed? Even in the case of that most precious Creed called the Athanasian,--why
need we assume that "the growth of ideas" has been a spurious growth? What if it should prove,
on the contrary, that the development has been that of the plant from the seed[211]? Above
all, why talk of "the fourth or sixth century,"--as if the Creeds were not essentially much
older; nay, co-eval with Christianity itself?... Such writing shews nothing so much as a confused
mind,--a weak, ill-informed, and illogical thinker.

Indeed Mr. Jowett seems to be altogether in the dark on the subject of the Creeds: for he speaks
of them as "the result of three or four centuries of reflection and controversy," (p. 353,)--which
is by no means true of all of them; nor, except in a certain sense, of any. But when he inquires,--"If
the occurrence of the phraseology of the Nicene age in a verse of the Epistles would detect
the spuriousness of the verse in which it was found,--how can the Nicene or Athanasian Creed
be a suitable instrument for the interpretation of Scripture?" (p. 354.)--he simply asks a
fool's question. The cases are not only not parallel, but there is not even any analogy between
them. Let us hear him a little further:--

"Absorbed as St. Paul was in the person of Christ, ... he does not speak of Him as 'equal to
the Father,' or 'of one substance with the Father[212].' Much of the language of the Epistles,
(passages for example such as Romans i. 2: Philippians ii. 6,) would lose their meaning if
distributed in alternate clauses between our LORD'S Humanity and Divinity[213]. Still greater
difficulties would be introduced into the Gospels by the attempt to identify them with the
Creeds[214]. We should have to suppose that He was and was not tempted[215]; that when He prayed
to His Father He prayed also to Himself[216]; that He knew and did not know 'of that hour'
of which He as well as the angels were ignorant[217]. How could He have said 'My God, My God,
why hast Thou forsaken Me?' or 'Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from Me.' How could
He have doubted whether 'when the Son of Man cometh He shall find faith upon the earth[218]?'
These simple and touching words," (p. 355,)--pah!

Now if what precedes means anything at all,--(I am by no means certain however that it does!)--it
means that the writer does not believe in the Divinity of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. Unless the
sentence which is without a reference to the foot of the page be not a denial of the fundamental
Doctrine of the Faith[219],--I do not understand it. But look at all which precedes; and then
say if those are the remarks of a man entitled to dogmatize "On the Interpretation of Scripture."
... If Mr. Jowett really means that the Creeds cannot be reconciled with the Bible,--how can
he himself subscribe to the VIIIth Article? If he means nothing of the kind,--why does he write
in such a weak, cloudy, illogical way?

But the whole of the case has not even yet been stated. Down from the remote period of which
we have been hitherto speaking,--the age of primitive Creeds, and oecumenical Councils, and
ancient Fathers,--in every country of the civilized world to which the Gospel has spread,--the
loftiest Intellect, the profoundest Learning, the sincerest Piety, have invariably endorsed
the ancient and original method of interpretation. I am not implying that such corroboration
was in any sense required; but the circumstance that it has been obtained, at least deserves
attention. Modes of thought are dependent on times and countries. There is a fashion in all
things. Great advances in Science,--grand epochs in civilization,--vicissitudes of opinion,--difference
of institutions, national traditions, and the like,--might be supposed to have wrought a permanent
change even in this department of Sacred Science. But it is not so. The storm has raged from
one quarter or other of the heavens, but has ever spent its violence in vain. Still has the
Church Catholic retained her own unbroken tradition. To keep to the history of that Church
to which we, by GOD'S mercy, belong:--The constant appeal, at the time of our own great Reformation,
was to the Fathers of the first four centuries. Ever since, the temper and spirit of our Commentators
has been to revert to the same standard, to reproduce the same teaching. The most powerful
minds and the most holy spirits,--English Divines of the deepest thought and largest reading,--let
me add, of the soundest judgment and severest discrimination,--have, in every age, down to
the present, gratefully accepted not only the method, but even the very details of primitive
Patristic Interpretation. But "the acceptance of a hundred generations and the growing authority
arising from it,"--like "the institutions based upon such ancient writings, and the history
into which they have entwined themselves indissolubly for many centuries,"--all conspire to
"constitute a perpetually increasing and strengthening[220]" body of evidence on the subject
of Sacred Interpretation.

Now, to oppose to the learning, and piety, and wisdom, of every age of the English Church,--to
the unbroken testimony of the Church Universal,--(3) to the torrent of Patristic Antiquity,--(4)
the decision of early Councils, and (5) the 'still small voice' of primitive Creeds,--yet more,
(6) to the constant practice of the Apostles,--and, above all, (7) to the indisputable method
of our Divine LORD Himself;--to oppose to all this mighty accumulation of evidence, the simple
à priori convictions of--Mr. Jowett! savours so strongly of the ridiculous, that it really
seems superfluous to linger over the antithesis for a single moment.

$4.$ Our task might now be looked upon as completed.--It only remains, in justice to the gentleman
whose method we have been considering, to ascertain by what considerations he is induced to
reject that method of Interpretation which, as we have seen, enjoys such overwhelming sanction.

(i) In opposition to what goes before, then, he throws out a suggestion, that "nothing would
be more likely to restore a natural feeling on this subject than a History of the Interpretation
of Scripture. It would take us back to the beginning; it would present in one view the causes
which have darkened the meaning of words in the course of ages." (p. 338-9.) "Such a work would
enable us to separate the elements of Doctrine and Tradition with which the meaning of Scripture
is encumbered in our own day." (p. 339.)

Let us here be well understood with our author. The advantage of a good "History of Interpretation"
would indeed be incalculably great. But Mr. Jowett, (like most other writers of his class,)
assumes the point he has to prove, when he insinuates that the result of such a contribution
to our Theological Literature would be to shew that all the world has been in error for 1700
years, and that he alone is right. That 'erring fancy' has often been at work in the fields
of sacred criticism,--who ever doubted? That there have been epochs of Interpretation,--different
Schools,--and varying tastes, in the long course of so many centuries of mingled light and
darkness, learning and barbarism;--what need to declare? A faithful history of Interpretation
would of course establish these facts on a sure foundation.

But the Reverend Author forgets his Logic when he goes on from these undoubted generalities
to imply that all has been confusion and utter uncertainty until now. Above all, common regard
for the facts of the case ought to have preserved him from putting forth so monstrous a falsehood
as the following:--"Among German Commentators there is for the first time in the history of
the world, an approach to agreement and certainty." (p. 340.)

Let us however,--passing by the many crooked remarks and unsound inferences with which the
Reverend writer, (more suo,) delights to perplex a plain question[221],--invite him to abide
by the test which he himself proposes. For 1700 years, (he says,) the Interpretation of Scripture
has been obscured and encumbered by successive Schools of Interpretation. The Interpreter's
concern (he says) is with the Bible itself. "The simple words of that book he tries to preserve
absolutely pure from the refinements of later times.... The greater part of his learning is
a knowledge of the text itself." [He is evidently the very man who sweeps the house to discover
the pearl of great price. (p. 414.)] "He has no delight in the voluminous literature which
has overgrown it. He has no theory of Interpretation. A few rules guarding against common errors
are enough for him.... He wants to be able to open his eyes, and see or imagine things as they
truly are." (p. 338.) [How crooked by the way is all this! "He has no theory of Interpretation[222]?"
Why, no; for the best of all reasons. He denies Inspiration altogether! His "theory" is that
the Bible is an uninspired Book! ... How peculiar too, and how plaintive is the "want" of the
supposed Interpreter, "to he able to open his eyes;"--glued up, as they no doubt are, by the
superstitious tendencies of the nineteenth century, and the tyranny of an intolerant age!]

But we may perhaps state the matter more intelligibly and simply, thus:--In order to ascertain
the true principle of Scriptural Interpretation, let us,--divesting ourselves of the complicated
and voluminous lore of 1700 years,--resort to the Bible itself. Let us go for our views to
the fountain-head; and abide by what we shall discover there.

A fairer proposal (as I think) never was made. It exactly describes the method which I have
humbly endeavoured myself to pursue in the ensuing Sermons. The inquiry will be found elaborated
from  p. 141 to p. 160 of the present volume; and the result is to be read on the last-named
page, in the following words:--"that it may be regarded as a fundamental rule, that the Bible
is not to be interpreted like a common book. This I gather infallibly from the plain fact,
that the inspired writers themselves habitually interpret it as no other book either is, or
can be interpreted.--Next, I assert without fear of contradiction that inspired Interpretation,
whatever varieties of method it may exhibit, is yet uniform and unequivocal in this one result;
namely, that it proves Holy Scripture to be of far deeper significancy than at first sight
appears. By no imaginable artifice of Rhetoric or sophistry of evasion,--by no possible vehemence
of denial or plausibility of counter assertion,--can it be rendered probable that Scripture
has invariably one only meaning; and that meaning, the most obvious and easy."

Now, the reader is requested to observe that what precedes is the direct contradictory of the
position which Mr. Jowett has written his Essay in order to establish. And thus we keep for
ever coming back to his πρῶτον ψεῦδος,--the fundamental falsity which underlies the whole of
what he has written.

(ii) But although we have eagerly resorted to Scripture itself in order to ascertain on what
principle Scripture ought to be interpreted, we cannot for a moment allow some of the sophistries
with which the Reverend Author has encumbered the question, to escape without castigation.
He may not first court an appeal to the School of Apostolical Interpretation; and then, before
the result of that appeal has been ascertained, go off in praise of the illumination of the
present age; and claim to represent the Theological mind of Europe in his own person. "Educated
persons," (he has the impertinence to assert,) "are beginning to ask (!), not what Scripture
may be made to mean, but what it does. And it is no exaggeration to say that he who in the
present state of knowledge will confine himself to the plain meaning of words, and the study
of their context, may know more of the original spirit and intention of the authors of the
New Testament than all the controversial writers of former ages put together." (pp. 340-1.)
This might be tolerated perhaps, in the self-constituted oracle of a Mechanics' Institute;
but as proceeding from a Divinity Lecturer in one of the first Colleges in Oxford, I hesitate
not to declare that such an opinion is simply disgraceful.

Very much of a piece with this, in point of flippancy,--(though barely consistent with his
frequent assertions that the entire subject is hemmed in by grave difficulties,)--are the Regius
Professor of Greek's remarks on the value of learning as a help to the Interpretation of Holy
Writ. "Learning obscures as well as illustrates." (p. 337.)--"There seem to be reasons for
doubting whether any considerable light can be thrown on the New Testament from inquiry into
the language." (p. 393.)--"Minute corrections of tenses or particles are no good." (p. 393.)--"Discussions
respecting the chronology of St. Paul's life and his second imprisonment; or about the identity
of James, the brother of the LORD; or, in another department, respecting the use of the Greek
article,--have gone far beyond the line of utility." (p. 393.) "The minuteness of the study
of Greek in our own day has also a tendency to introduce into the text associations which are
not really found there." (p. 391.)--Lastly, he complains of "the error of interpreting every
particle, as though it were a link in the argument; instead of being, as is often the case,
an excrescence of style." (p. 391.)

So then, in brief, the Fathers are in a conspiracy to mislead: Creeds and Councils encumber
the sense: Modern Commentators are not to be trusted: the comparison of Scripture with Scripture,
except it be "of the same age and the same authors," "will tend rather to confuse than to elucidate:"
(p. 383:) "Learning obscures," and an accurate appreciation of the meaning of the text is "no
good!"--"When the meaning of Greek words is once known[223], the young student has almost all
the real materials which are possessed by the greatest Biblical scholar, in the book itself."
(p. 384.) In a word, (as Dr. Moberly has had the manliness to remark,)--"It simply comes to
this: A little Greek, (not too much,) and a strong self-relying imagination, and you may interpret
Holy Scripture as well as--Mr. Jowett!" (p. lxii.) ... Benighted himself, the unhappy author
of this Essay is so apprehensive lest a ray of light from Heaven shall break in upon one of
his disciples,--even sideways, as it were, from the margin of the Bible,--that he carefully
prohibits "the indiscriminate use of parallel passages" as "useless and uncritical." ... Yet
may one not with discrimination refer to the margin?--Better not! "No good!" (p. 393.) replies
the Oracle. "Even the critical use of parallel passages is not without danger." (p. 383.) ...
O shame! And all this from a College Tutor and Lecturer on Divinity! this from one entrusted
with the care of educating young men! this from a Regius Professor of Greek[224]!

Mr. Jowett congratulates himself that "Biblical criticism has made two great steps onward,--at
the time of the Reformation, and in our own day." (p. 340;) he clearly requires to be reminded
that the success of the Divinity of the Reformation was owing to the grand appeal then made
to the Patristic writings.

So far then as any of ourselves are resorting to those sources of information, there may be
a faint resemblance in kind between the spirit which animates us, and that which wrought so
nobly in the Fathers of our spiritual freedom,--Cranmer and Ridley and the other learned and
holy men who revised our Offices. But if "German Commentators" and their method be supposed
to be the ideals to which the age is tending, then the Theology of the middle of the nineteenth
century stands in marked contrast to what prevailed in the middle of the sixteenth; and our
spirit is the very reverse of theirs.--But I hasten on.

(iii) "The uncertainty which prevails in the Interpretation of Scripture," Mr. Jowett proposes
to get rid of,--(this is in fact the aim of his entire Essay,) by denying that there are in
Scripture any deeper meanings to interpret. In the meantime, by every device in his power,
he seeks from à priori considerations, (as we have seen,) to shew that no such meanings can
exist. We allow ourselves to be biassed, to a singular extent, he says, "by certain previous
suppositions with which we come to the perusal of Scripture." (p. 342.) But for this, "no one
would interpret Scripture as many do." (Ibid.) Let us ascertain then what these erroneous "suppositions"
are.

(=1=) "The failure of a prophecy is never admitted, in spite of Scripture and of history, (Jer.
xxxvi. 30. Isaiah xxiii. Amos vii. 10-17.)" (p. 343.)

Now this can only mean two things: viz. first, that a Divine Prophecy is not an infallible
utterance: and secondly, that the three places quoted from the Old Testament are proofs of
the fallibility of Prophecy; proofs which ought to overcome prejudice, and persuade men to
renounce their "previous supposition" that Prophecy is infallible.

Certainly the charge is a grave one. For if Prophecy is untrue, then what becomes of Inspiration?

And yet, how stands the case? The writer seems to have expected "that no one would refer to
the passages that he has bracketed, or that all would be too ignorant to know the utter groundlessness
of his assumption. If there are, in the whole Scripture, two past prophecies which were signally
and remarkably fulfilled, they are the first two which he has selected as instances to be dropped
down, without a remark, of the failure of Scripture prophecies! And as to the third passage,
surely it implies an 'incuria' which might be deemed 'crassa' to have asserted that it contained
an instance of the non-fulfilment of Prophecy: for it implies that Mr. Jowett has read the
verses to which he refers with so little attention as not to have discovered that the prediction
which failed of its fulfilment was no utterance of Amos, but was the message of Amaziah, the
priest of Bethel, in which he falsely attributes to Amos words he had not spoken!... Surely
such slips as these are as discreditable to a scholar as a Divine[225]!"

And this, from a gentleman who has the impertinence to remind us oracularly, that "he who would
understand the nature of Prophecy in the Old Testament, should have the courage to examine
how far its details were minutely fulfilled!" (p. 347.) Are we then to infer that Mr. Jowett's
courage failed him when he came to Amos vii. 10-17?

(=2=) "The mention of a name later than the supposed age of the prophet is not allowed, as
in other writings, to be taken in evidence of the date. (Isaiah xlv. 1.)" (p. 343.)

But what is the meaning of this complaint when applied to Isaiah's well known prophecy concerning
Cyrus? In the words of the excellent critic last quoted,--"We know not that we could point
to such an instance as this in the writings of any other author of credit. Of course, Mr. Jowett
knows as well as we do the distinction between History and Prophecy; and that the mention in
any document of the name of one who was unborn at the time fixed as the date of the writing,
would be at once a complete disproof of its accuracy as a history of the past, and a proof
of its accuracy as a prediction of the future. Of course he also remembers that the point he
has to prove is that this passage is History and not Prediction; and his mode of proving is
this; he assumes that it is a history of the past,--advancing as a charge against the believers
of Revelation, that they do not, (as they would in any other History,) reject the genuineness
of the passage because it embalms a future name in a past history!... This audacious, (for
we cannot use a weaker word,) assumption of what he has to prove, pervades his Essay[226]."

And thus, into whatever department of speculation we follow this writer, the tortuous path
is still found to conduct us back to the same underlying fallacious assumption,--viz. that
the Bible is like any other Book; in other words, is not inspired.

(=3=) Persons in Mr. Jowett's position, "find themselves met by a sort of presupposition that
'GOD speaks not as Man speaks.'"--(p. 343.)

"A sort of presupposition," indeed!... Does the Reverend gentleman really expect that we will
stoop so low as argue this point also with him? It shall suffice to have branded him with his
own words.

"The suspicion of Deism, or perhaps of Atheism, awaits inquiry. By such fears, a good man (!)
refuses to be influenced: a philosophical mind (!) is apt to cast them aside with too much
bitterness. It is better to close the book, than to read it under conditions of thought which
are imposed from without." (p. 343.)

Well surely, the proximity to Balliol College of the scene of Cranmer and Ridley's martyrdom,
must have turned the brain of the Regius Professor of Greek!--Let him be well assured however
that not rational "Inquiry," but irrational assumption; not the modest cogitations of "a philosophical
mind," but the arrogant dreams of a weak and confused intellect, are what have excited such
general indignation of late, among "good men," from one end of the Kingdom to the other. Nor
could anything probably of equal pretensions be readily appealed to, which is nevertheless
more truly unphilosophical, fallacious, and foolish, than the Essay now under consideration.

(iv) Subsequently, (p. 344,) Mr. Jowett professes to grapple with the phenomenon of Inspiration.
His method is instructive. 2, 7-9. 1 Cor. xv. 3. Ephes. iii. 3, &c., &c.? But I have established
the contradictory of the Professor's position in the ensuing Sermons, p. 53 to p. 57, to which
the reader must be referred.--This done, he proceeds to assert that,

(=1=) Inspiration does not preserve a writer from inaccuracy. And the charge is substantiated
by the following ridiculous enumeration:--"One [Evangelist] supposes the original dwelling-place
of our LORD'S Parents to have been Bethlehem[227], another Nazareth[228]." (This from a Lecturer
on Divinity! Does Mr. Jowett then suppose that his readers have never opened the Gospels, and
do not know better? Why, both his statements are simply false!)--"They trace His genealogy
in different ways." (Yes. In two. And why not in twenty? Is Mr. Jowett not aware that a genealogy
may be differently traced through different ancestors?)--"One mentions the thieves blaspheming:
another has preserved to after ages the record of the penitent thief:" (And why should he not?)--"They
appear to differ about the day and hour of the Crucifixion." (Yes, they appear to differ: but
they do not differ!)--"The narrative of the woman who anointed our LORD'S feet with ointment
is told in all four, each narrative having more or less considerable variations." (There is
no conceivable reason why this should not have been as Mr. Jowett relates; but, as a matter
of fact, we have here another of this Gentleman's private blunders,--shewing what an uncritical
reader he must be, of that book concerning which he presumes to dogmatize so freely.)--"These
are a few instances of the differences which arose in the traditions of the earliest ages respecting
the history of our LORD." (Nay, but this is to beg the whole question!)--"He who wishes to
investigate the character of the sacred writings should not be afraid to make a catalogue of
them all, with the view of estimating their cumulative weight." The absence of such a fulfilment
may further lead him to discover that he took the letter for the spirit in expecting it." (p.
347.) But really this is again simply to beg the whole question. Unbecoming in any writer,
how absurd also is such a sentence from the pen of one who, (as we have lately seen,) no sooner
descends to particulars than he makes himself ridiculous by betraying his own excessive ignorance....
"The letter for the spirit," also! which is one of the 'cant' expressions of Mr. Jowett and
his accomplices in 'free handling,'--based evidently on a misconception of the meaning of 2
Cor. iii. 6. The contrast recurs at pp. 36, 357, 375, 425, &c., &c.

(=2=) Still bent on shewing that Inspiration does not secure Scripture from blots and blemishes,
Mr. Jowett proceeds as follows. (I must present him to the reader, for a short space, in extenso;
since by no other expedient can the complicated fallacies of his very intricate and perverse
method be exposed.)

"Inspiration is a fact which we infer from the study of Scripture,--not of one portion only,
but of the whole." (p. 347.) (Now even this is not a correct way of stating the case. Still,
because the words may bear an honourable sense, we pass on.)--"Obviously then, it embraces
writings of very different kinds,--the book of Esther, for example, or the Song of Solomon,
as well as the Gospel of St. John." (That the volume of Inspiration is of this complex character,
and that it embraces writings so diverse, is beyond dispute.)--"It is reconcileable with the
mixed good and evil of the characters of the Old Testament, which nevertheless does not exclude
them from the favour of GOD." (Why the Inspiration of a writer should not be 'reconcileable'
with any amount of wickedness in the persons about whom he writes,--I am quite at a loss to
perceive. What else becomes of your hope, and mine, of Eternal Life?)--"Inspiration is also
reconcileable," (he proceeds,)--"with the attribution to the Divine Being of actions at variance
with that higher revelation which He has given of Himself in the Gospel." (Is this meant as
an insult to "the Divine Being?" or simply as a slur on Revelation? Either way, we reject the
charge with indignation[229].)--"It is not inconsistent with imperfect or opposite aspects
of the Truth, as in the Book of Job or Ecclesiastes:" (Nothing which comes from GOD should
be called "imperfect:" but why different aspects of the Truth should not be brought out, by
different writers, as by St. Paul and by James,--it is hard to see.)--"With variations of fact
in the Gospels, or the Books of Kings and Chronicles:" (We do not admit that Inspiration is
consistent with "variations of fact;" but with different versions of the same incident, it
is confessedly compatible.)--"With inaccuracies of language in the Epistles of St. Paul." (With
grammatical inelegancies, no doubt; but not with logical inaccuracies.)--"For these are all
found in Scripture:" (This statement, by the way, should have been substantiated by at least
as many references as there are heads in the indictment,)--"neither is there any reason why
they should not be; except a general impression that Scripture ought to have been written in
a way different from what it has." (Just as if Mankind for 1800 years had been the victims
of an à priori conception as to how Holy Scripture ought to have been written!)--"A principle
of progressive revelation admits them all; and this is already contained in the words of our
SAVIOUR, 'Moses because of the hardness of your hearts;' or even in the Old Testament, 'Henceforth
there shall be no more this proverb in the house of Israel?'" (O if Catholic writers were to
expound Holy Scripture with the license of these gentlemen!... That the scheme of Revelation
has been progressive, is a Theological truism. What that has to do with the question in hand,
I see not.)--"For what is progressive is necessarily imperfect in its earlier stages:" ("Imperfect"
in what sense?)--"and even erring to those who come after." (No, not in that sense imperfect,
certainly!) ... "There is no more reason why imperfect narratives should be excluded from Scripture
than imperfect grammar; no more ground for expecting that the New Testament would be logical
or Aristotelian in form, than that it would be written in Attic Greek." (Now why this cloudy
shuffling about "imperfect narratives,"--instead of saying what you mean, like a man! Further,--Is
Mr. Jowett so weak as not to perceive that there is no force whatever in his supposed parallel?
The Discourses of the Incarnate SON, for instance, are certainly anything but "Aristotelian
in form." His dialect,--(Angels bowed to catch it, I nothing doubt!)--was that of the despised
Galilee. But need the teaching it conveyed have therefore been "imperfect?" Why may not the
least perfect Greek be the vehicle for the more perfect Doctrine? What connexion is there between
the casket and the jewel which it encloses?)

(=3=) The Reverend writer promises us help, from "another consideration which has been neglected
by writers on this subject." (We scarcely see the drift of this ill-worded proposition; but
are disposed to assent.)--"The same fact cannot be true and untrue," (Who ever supposed that
it could?)--"any more than the same words can have two opposite meanings." (But why glide at
once into a gross falsity? Are there not plenty of words and speeches, of the kind called 'equivocal'
or 'ambiguous,' which are of this nature? I am content to refer this writer to his own pages,
for the abundant refutation of his own assertion. No man in the world knows better than Mr.
Jowett that "the same words can have two opposite meanings.") "The same fact cannot be true
in Religion, when seen by the light of Faith; and untrue in Science, when looked at through
the medium of evidence or experiment." (Why not? For example,--'He maketh His Sun to rise.'
'If GOD so clothe the grass of the field.' 'GOD said, Let there be light.' Who sees not that
the view which Faith and which Physical Science respectively take of the same phenomenon, may
essentially differ?)--"It is ridiculous to suppose that the Sun goes round the Earth in the
same sense in which the Earth goes round the Sun;" (Very ridiculous.)--"or that the world appears
to have existed, but has not existed, during the vast epochs of which Geology speaks to us."
(Leave out the words, "appears to have," and this also is undeniable.)--"But if so, there is
no need of elaborate reconcilements of Revelation and Science." (How does that follow? If what
is thought to be Divinely revealed, and what is thought to be scientifically ascertained, seem
to be conflicting truths,--why should not an effort be made to reconcile them?) "They reconcile
themselves the moment any scientific truth is distinctly ascertained." (Yes: by the Human simply
trying to thrust the Divine out of doors!)--"As the idea of Nature enlarges, the idea of Revelation
also enlarges:" (I deny that there is any such intimate connexion as this author supposes between
Physical Science and Divinity,)--"it was a temporary misunderstanding which severed them."
(But when were Nature and Revelation ever for an instant "severed?")--"And as the knowledge
of Nature which is possessed by the few is communicated in its leading features at least, to
the many, they will receive it with a higher conception of the ways of GOD to Man. It may hereafter
appear as natural to the majority of Mankind to see the Providence of GOD in the order of the
world, as it once was to appeal to interruptions of it." (p. 349.) (And pray, what "facts"
are these, relative to the "beginnings of the Human Race," which conflict with Scripture?)
... "Almost all intelligent persons are agreed that the earth has existed for myriads of ages:"
(Which is perfectly true.)--"The best informed are of opinion that the history of nations extends
back some thousand years before the Mosaic Chronology." (Which is decidedly false.)--"Recent
discoveries in Geology may perhaps open a further vista of existence for the human species;
while it is possible, and may one day be known, that Mankind spread not from one but from many
centres over the globe; or, (as others say,) that the supply of links which are at present
wanting in the chain of animal life may lead to new conclusions respecting the origin of Man."
(A cool way, this, of anticipating that something which 'may'--(or may not!)--be discovered
hereafter, will demonstrate that the beginning of the Bible is all a fable!)--"Now," (proceeds
our author,) "let it be granted that" "the proof of some of these facts, especially of those
last-mentioned, is wanting; still it is a false policy to set up Inspiration or Revelation
in opposition to them, a principle which can have no influence on them, and should be kept
rather out of their way." (Considerate man!) "The Sciences of Geology and comparative Philology
are steadily gaining ground. Many of the guesses of twenty years ago have been certainties;
and the guesses of to-day may hereafter become so. Shall we peril Religion (!) on the possibility
of their untruth? on such a cast to stake the life of Man, implies not only a recklessness
of facts (!), but a misunderstanding of the nature of the Gospel. If it is fortunate for Science,
it is perhaps more fortunate for Christian Truth, that the admission of Galileo's discovery
has for ever settled the principle of the relations between them."--(pp. 349-50.) ...

Now, what a curious picture of a perverse and crooked mind does such a sentence exhibit! Divine
Revelation can "have no influence" of course, on facts of any kind, (including facts in Physical
Science,) when once those facts have been well ascertained. But, in the entire absence of such
facts, why should we refuse to listen to the well ascertained Revelation of GOD? Nothing is
more emphatic, for example, than the Divine declaration that the whole Human family is derived
from a single pair; and the origin of Man is plainly set down in Genesis. Why then oppose to
this, the confessedly undiscovered fact that "mankind spread from many centres;" and the purely
speculative possibility that, hereafter, a certain theory "may lead to new conclusions respecting
the origin of Man?"--As for "Religion" being "perilled on the possibility" of the truth or
untruth of the Sciences of Geology and comparative Philology;--we really would submit that
GOD may be safely left to take care of His own; and that "peril," there is,--there can be,--none!

And then, the maudlin tenderness of an "Essayist and Reviewer" (of all persons in the world!)
for "the life of Man,"--meaning thereby his Christian hope, and Faith in the REDEEMER!... As
if, (first,) Man's "Life" were in any sense endangered, by our upholding the honour and authority
of the Bible! And (secondly,) as if the age had shewn itself in the least degree impatient
of scientific investigation! And (thirdly,) as if Religion depended, or could be made to depend,
on Physical phenomena, or on the progress of Natural Science, at all! ... I scruple not to
say that arguments like these impress me with the meanest opinion of Mr. Jowett's intellectual
powers: while they prove to demonstration that he does not in the least understand the subject
on which he yet writes with such feeble vehemence.

But I may not proceed any further, or my pages will equal in extent those of the gentleman
already named. Indeed, to follow that most confused of thinkers, and crooked of disputants,
through all his perverse pages; to expose his habitual paltry evasive dodging,--his shifting
equivocations,--his misapplications of Scripture,--his unworthy insinuations,--his plaintive
puerilities of thought and sentiment;--would require a thick volume.--If Mr. Jowett does not
deny the Personality of the HOLY GHOST, he ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself for penning
sentences which can lead to no other inference. For he ought to know that when men talk of
words "receiving a more exact meaning than they will truly bear;" and of what "is spoken in
a figure being construed with the severity of a logical statement, while passages of an opposite
tenour are overlooked or set aside:"--(p. 360.) men mean to repudiate the doctrine which those
words are thought to convey; not to imply their acceptance of it.--So again, if Mr. Jowett
holds the doctrine of Original Sin, he ought to be heartily ashamed of himself for having insinuated
that it depends "on two figurative expressions of St. Paul to which there is no parallel in
any other part of Scripture." (p. 361.)--Nor, however moderate his attainments as a teacher
of Divinity, ought he to be capable of putting forth such a notorious misstatement as that
the doctrine of Infant Baptism rests upon a verse in the Acts (xvi. 33,)--which verse has really
nothing whatever to do with the question[231]. (p. 360.)

Professor Jowett shuts up his Essay with a passage which, for a certain amount of tender pathos
in the sentiment, has been often quoted, and sometimes admired, He says:--

"The suspicion or difficulty which attends critical inquiries is no reason for doubting their
value. The Scripture nowhere leads us to suppose that the circumstance of all men speaking
well of us is any ground for supposing that we are acceptable in the sight of God. And there
is no reason why the condemnation of others should be witnessed to by our own conscience. Perhaps
it may be true that, owing to the jealousy or fear of some, the reticence of others, the terrorism
of a few, we may not always find it easy to regard these subjects with calmness and judgment.
Every one, whether a student of Theology or not, has need to make war against his prejudices
no less than against his passions; and, in the religious teacher, the first is even more necessary
than the last.... He who takes the prevailing opinions of Christians and decks them out in
their gayest colours,--who reflects the better mind of the world to itself--is likely to be
its favourite teacher. In that ministry of the Gospel, even when assuming forms repulsive to
persons of education (!), no doubt the good is far greater than the error or harm. But there
is also a deeper work which is not dependent on the opinions of men, in which many elements
combine, some alien to Religion, or accidentally at variance with it. That work can hardly
expect to win much popular favour, so far as it runs counter to the feelings of religious parties.
But he who bears a part in it may feel a confidence, which no popular caresses or religious
sympathy could inspire, that he has by a Divine help been enabled to plant his foot somewhere
beyond the waves of Time. He may depart hence before the natural term, worn out with intellectual
toil; regarded with suspicion by many of his contemporaries; yet not without a sure hope that
the love of Truth, which men of saintly lives often seem to slight, is, nevertheless, accepted
before GOD."--(pp. 432-3.)

My respect for a fellow-man induces me to offer a few remarks on all this.

Let me be permitted then to declare that I am as incapable as any one who ever breathed the
air of this lower world, of making light of the sentiments of true genius. I can respond with
my whole heart to the passion-stricken cry of one who, when "regarded with suspicion by many
of his contemporaries," is observed to hail his fellows with confidence, across the gulph of
Time; and as it were implore them, after many days, to do him right. Nay, were I to behold
a man of splendid, but misguided powers, elaborating from GOD'S Word a plausible system of
his own, whereby to bring back the Golden Age to suffering Humanity; and insisting that he
beheld in the common revelations of the SPIRIT, the unsuspected outlines of such a form of
polity as Man never dreamed of,--(nor, it may be, Angels either;)--I should experience a kind
of generous sympathy with this bright-eyed enthusiast; even while I proceeded to test his wild
dream by what I believed to be the standard of right Reason. Then, as the specious fabric was
seen suddenly to collapse and melt away, should I not, with affectionate sorrow, secretly mourn
that such brilliant parts had not been enlisted on the side of Truth? and feel as if I could
have been content to go about for life maimed in body, or hopelessly impoverished in estate,
if so great a disaster could but have been prevented as the loss of one who ought to have been
a standard-bearer in Israel?

Once more. Although the cold shade of unbelief has never for an instant, (thank GOD!) darkened
my spirit; so that one may not be very apt to sympathize with men who walk about hampered with
a doubt; yet, were one to know, (as one has often known,--too often, alas!) that the arrow
was rankling in a friend's heart,--who by consequence shunned the society of his fellows, and
walked in moody abstraction,--looking as if life had lost its charm, and as if nothing on the
earth's surface were any longer to him a joy;--would one not be the first to go after such
a sufferer; and seek whether a firm hand and steady eye might not avail to extract the poisoned
shaft? If that might not be, at least by daily acts of unaltered kindness, and the ways which
brotherly sympathy suggests, who would not strive to recover such an one? If all other arts
proved unavailing, it would remain for a man with the ordinary instincts of humanity, in silence
and sorrow at least, to look on, while the solitary doubter was paying the bitter penalty,--doubtless,
of his sin.

But how widely different,--rather, how utterly dissimilar,--is the phenomenon before us! Here
is a singularly confused and shallow thinker oppressed with the vastness of his discovery,
that the Bible--has nothing in it! Here is a Clergyman of the Church of England, and a Lecturer
in Divinity, whose difficulty is how he shall convince the world that the Bible is--like any
other book! Here is the sceptical fellow of a College, conspiring with six others, to produce
a volume of which Germany itself, (having changed its mind,) would already be ashamed!... Mr.
Jowett is enthusiastic for a negation! Without belief himself, he cannot rest because Christendom
has, on the whole, a good deal of belief remaining! If he may but unsettle somebody's mind,--his
Essay will have achieved its purpose, and its author will not have lived in vain!... Sublime
privilege for "the only man in the University of Oxford who" is said to "exercise a moral and
spiritual influence at all corresponding to that which was once wielded by John Henry Newman[232]!"

I shall be thought a very profane person, I dare say, by the friends and apologists of Mr.
Jowett, if I avow that the passage with which he concludes his Essay, instead of sounding in
my ears like the plaintive death-song of departing Genius, sounds to me like nothing so much
as the piteous whine of a schoolboy who knows that he deserves chastisement, and perceives
that he is about to experience his deserts. System, or Theory, the Reverend Gentleman has none
to propose. Views, except negative ones, Mr. Jowett is altogether guiltless of. Can anybody
in his senses suppose that a man "has, by a Divine help (!), been enabled to plant his foot
somewhere beyond the waves of Time," (p. 433,) who doubts everything, and believes nothing?
Can any one of sane mind dream that posterity will come to the rescue of a man who, when he
is asked for his story, rejoins, (with a well-known needy mechanic,) that he has "none to tell,
Sir?" What then is posterity to vindicate? What has the Regius Professor of Greek written so
many weak pages to prove? Just nothing! If Mr. Jowett's Essay could enforce the message it
carries, the result would simply be that the world would become disbelievers in the Inspiration
of the Bible: they would disbelieve that Scripture has any sense but that which lies on the
surface: they would therefore disbelieve the Prophets and Evangelists and Apostles of CHRIST:
they would disbelieve the words of our LORD JESUS CHRIST Himself!... Has Mr. Jowett, then,
grown grey under the laborious process of arriving at this series of negations? When he anticipates
"departing hence before the natural term," does he mean that he is "worn out with the intellectual
toil" of propounding nothing! and that he expects the sympathy and gratitude of posterity for
what he has propounded?

But this is not all. Instead of coming abroad, (if come abroad he must,) in that garb of humility
which befits doubt,--that self-distrust which becomes one whose fault, or whose misfortune
it is, that he simply cannot believe,--Mr. Jowett assumes throughout, the insolent air of intellectual
superiority; the tone of one at whose bidding Theology must absolutely 'keep moving.' A truncheon
and a number on his collar, alone seem wanting. The menacing voice, and authoritative air,
are certainly not away,--as I proceed to shew.

"It may be observed that a change in some of the prevailing modes of Interpretation, is not
so much a matter of expediency as of necessity. The original meaning of Scripture is beginning
to be understood." (p. 418.)

"Criticism has far more power than it formerly had. It has spread itself over ancient, and
even modern history.... Whether Scripture can be made an exception to other ancient writings,
now that the nature of both is more understood; whether ... the views of the last century will
hold out,--these are questions respecting which" (p. 420.) it is hard to judge.

"It has to be considered whether the intellectual forms under which Christianity has been described,
may not also be in a state of transition." (p. 420.)

"Now, as the Interpretation of Scripture is receiving another character, it seems that distinctions
of Theology which were in great measure based on old Interpretations, are beginning to fade
away." ... "There are other signs that times are changing, and we are changing too." (p. 421.)

"These reflections bring us back to the question with which we began,--What effect will the
critical Interpretation of Scripture have on Theology?" (p. 422.)

Again:--"As the time has come when it is no longer possible to ignore the results of criticism,
it is of importance that Christianity should be seen to be in harmony with them." (p. 374.)
(The sentences which immediately follow shall be exhibited in distinct paragraphs, in order
that they may separately enjoy admiration. Each is a gem or a curiosity in its way.)

"That objections to some received views should be valid, and yet that they should be always
held up as the objections of Infidels,--is a mischief to the Christian cause."

"It is a mischief that critical observations which any intelligent man can make for himself
(!), should be ascribed to Atheism or Unbelief."

"It would be a strange and almost incredible thing that the Gospel, which at first made war
only on the vices of mankind, should now be opposed to one of the highest and rarest of human
virtues,--the love of Truth."

"And that in the present day the great object of Christianity should be, not to change the
lives of men, but to prevent them from changing their opinions; that would be a singular inversion
of the purposes for which CHRIST came into the world."

We are really constrained to pause for a moment, and to inquire what this last sentence means.
Are not "the lives of men" mainly dependent on "their opinions?" Why then contrast the two?
And which of our "opinions" does Mr. Jowett desire to see changed? Would he have us resign
our belief in the Atonement? reject the Divinity of CHRIST? deny the Personality of the HOLY
GHOST? put the Bible on a level with Sophocles and Plato? ridicule the idea of Inspiration?...
How would it be a "singular inversion of the purposes of CHRIST'S Coming," that Christianity
should "prevent" mankind from "changing" such "opinions" as these?

"The Christian religion is in a false position when all the tendencies of knowledge are opposed
to it." (All the tendencies of knowledge, then, are opposed to the Christian Religion!)

"Such a position cannot be long maintained, or can only end in the withdrawal of the educated
classes from the influences of Religion." (So we are to look for "the withdrawal of the educated
classes from the influences of Religion[233]!") After anticipating "religious dissolution,"
because of "the progress of ideas, (!) with which Christian teachers seem to be ill at ease,"
(!) Mr. Jowett, (who we presume is speaking of himself,) says, "Time was when the Gospel was
before the Age:" (The Gospel is therefore now behind the age!)--"when the difficulties of Christianity
were difficulties of the heart only:" (When was that?)--"and the highest minds found in its
truths not only the rule of their lives, but a well-spring of intellectual delight." (All this
then has ceased to be the case! "The highest minds" being of course represented by--Mr. Jowett!)

"Is it to be held a thing impossible that the Christian Religion, instead of shrinking into
itself, (!) may again embrace the thoughts of men upon the earth?" (that is to say, "embrace
the thoughts" of--Mr. Jowett!)--"Or is it true that since the Reformation 'all intellect has
gone the other way?'"

"But for the faith that the Gospel might win again the minds of intellectual men," (such men
as Mr. Jowett?)--"it would be better to leave Religion to itself, instead of attempting to
draw them together." (p. 376.)

Now this kind of language, in daily life, would be called sheer impertinence; and the person
who could talk so before educated gentlemen would probably receive an intimation that he was
making himself offensive. He would certainly be looked upon as a weak and conceited person.
I really am unable to see why things should be written and printed which no one would presume
to say! ... Encircled by a little atmosphere of fog of his own creating, Mr. Jowett is evidently
under the delusion that his own confused vision and misty language are the result of the giddy
eminence to which, (leaving his fellow-mortals far behind him,) he has contrived, all alone,
to soar. He anticipates the complaint of some unhappy disciple, that he "experiences a sort
of shrinking or dizziness at the prospect which is opening before him:" whereupon Mr. Jowett
invites the "highly educated young man," (p. 373,) to consider "that he may possibly not be
the person who is called upon to pursue such inquiries." Who are they for, then? "No man should
busy himself with them who has not clearness of mind enough to see things as they are." (p.
430.) The clearness of mind, for example, which belongs to Mr. Jowett!

True enough it is that had such airs been assumed by such an one as Richard Hooker, who achieved
the first four books of his 'Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity' before he was 40; and dying in
his 46th year, proved himself to be the greatest genius of his age:--had language like Mr.
Jowett's been found on the lips of Joseph Butler, who when he was 44 produced his immortal
'Analagy,' and at the age of 26 delivered his famous Rolls 'Sermons:'--had Bishop Bull been
betrayed into the language of self-complacency when, at the age of 35, he made himself famous
by his 'Harmonia Apostolica:'--the proceeding would have been intelligible, however much one
might have lamented such an exhibition of weakness.... But when the speaker proves to be one
of the very shallowest of thinkers, and most confused of reasoners;--a man who, although grey-headed,
has done nothing whatever for Literature, sacred or profane;--nor indeed is known out of Oxford
except for having been thought to deny the Doctrine of the Atonement;--a man who dogmatizes
in a Science of which he clearly does not know so much as the very alphabet; and presumes to
dispute about a Bible which he has evidently not read with the attention which is due even
to a first-rate uninspired book;--then, one's displeasure and impatience assume the form of
indignation and disgust. The Divine who, purposing to prove that Holy Scripture is in kind
like any other book, does so by inveighing against those who treat it differently; and indeed,
on every occasion, assumes as proved the thing he has to prove[234]:--is obviously the very
man to vaunt the privileges of the intellect. The student of the Bible who mistakes the utterance
of a lying prophet for the language of Amos, and then boldly charges the lie upon the inspired
author of a book of Canonical Scripture;--is of course a proper person to discuss the Prophetic
Canon. The gentleman who flatters himself that he has been sweeping the house to find the pearl
of great price, (p. 414,) is a very pretty person, truly, to lecture about the Gospel!... I
forbear reproaching Mr. Jowett with his invariable misapplications or misapprehensions of the
meaning of Scripture: his false glosses, and truly preposterous specimens of exegesis[235].
I am content to take leave of him, while he is flattering himself that he has "found the pearl
of great price, after sweeping the house:" (p. 414:) and under that melancholy delusion, I
fear he must be left,--holding the broom in his hands.

       *       *       *       *       *

On a review of these Seven Essays, few things strike one more forcibly than the utterly untenable
ground occupied by their authors. They are "in a position in which it is impossible to remain.
The theory of Mr. Jowett and his fellows is as false to philosophy as to the Church of England.
More may be true, or less; but to attempt to halt where they would stop is a simple absurdity[236]."

To exactness of method or System, their work can hardly pretend; and yet they have a system,--which
has only not been rounded into symmetry, by the singular circumstance that these seven writers
"have written in entire independence of one another, and without concert or comparison." They
avow a common purpose, however; for they "hope" that their joint labours "will be received
as an attempt to illustrate," (whatever that may mean,) "the advantage derivable to the cause
of Religion and Moral Truth" from what they have here attempted; and which they justly characterize
as "free handling." Putting oneself in their position, it is easy to imagine the sorrow and
concern,--the horror rather,--with which a good man, when the first edition of 'Essays and
Reviews' made its appearance, would have discovered the kind of complicity into which he had
been inadvertently betrayed; and how eagerly he would have withdrawn from a literary partnership
which had resulted so disastrously. At the end of nine large editions, however, the corporate
responsibility of each individual author has become fully established; and besides the many
proofs of sympathy between the several authors which these pages contain[237], it is no longer
doubtful that the sentiments of the work are to be quoted without reference to the individual
writers. It would be unfair to assume that not one of these seven men has had the manliness
to avow that his own individual convictions are opposed to those of his fellows. We are compelled
to regard their joint labours as one production. It is the corporate efficacy of the several
contributions which constitutes the chief criminality of the volume. It is to the respectability
and weight of the conjoined names of its authors, and to their combined efforts, that 'Essays
and Reviews' are indebted for all their power.

What then is the system, or theory, or view, advocated by these seven Authors?--They are all
agreed that we are "placed evidently at an epoch when Humanity finds itself under new conditions,
to form some definite conception to ourselves of the way in which Christianity is henceforward
to act upon the world which is our own." (p. 158.) To do this, we must emerge from our "narrow
chamber of Doctrinal and Ecclesiastical prepossessions." (p. 151.) We cannot "resist the tide
of civilization on which we are borne." (p. 66) are all opposed to the actual teaching of the
Church. Meantime, "the Christian Religion is in a false position when all the tendencies of
knowledge are opposed to it." Is it to be held a thing impossible that the Christian Religion
may again embrace the thoughts of men upon the earth?" (pp. 374-5.)

In the mean time, THE BIBLE is a stubborn fact in the way of the new Religion. (Ibid.) But
the Prayer-book confessedly stands on a different footing from the Bible. The Bible erects
itself hopelessly in the way of "the negative religion." (p. 151.) O those many prophecies,
which for 4000 long years sustained the faith of GOD'S chosen people, and at last found fulfilment
in the person of CHRIST, or in the circumstances which attended the establishment of His Kingdom!
O that glorious retinue of types and shadows which heralded MESSIAH'S approach!... And then,--O
the miraculous evidence which attested to the reality of His Divinity[238]! O the confirmation,
(to those who needed it,) when He walked the water, and stilled the storm, and cast out devils
by His word, and by one strong cry broke the gates of Death, and caused Lazarus to "Come forth!"
... O the solemn independent testimony borne by Creeds, from the very birthday of Christianity,--(whether
planted in Syria or in Asia Minor, in Africa or in Italy, in Greece or in Gaul; "in Germany
or in Spain, among the Celts or in the far East, in Egypt or in Libya, or in the middle regions
of the globe[239].") Lastly,--O the adoring voice of the whole Church Catholic throughout the
world, for many a succeeding century,--translating, expounding, defining, explaining, defending
to the death!... How shall all this formidable mass of evidence possibly be set aside?

It is plain that Prophecy must be evacuated of its meaning; or rather, must be denied entirely:
and to do this, falls to the share of the vulgar and violent Vice-Principal of Lampeter College.
Disprove he cannot; so he sneers and rails and blusters instead. Prophecy, he calls "omniscience;"
"a notion of foresight by vision of particulars;" (p.70;) "a kind of clairvoyance," (p. 70,)
and "literal prognostication." (p. 65.) Mr. Jowett (as we have lately seen[240],) lends plaintive
help: but indeed Dr. Williams does not lack supporters.

To deny the truth of Miracles falls to the lot of the Savilian Professor of Astronomy. His
method has the merit of extreme simplicity: for it is based on the ground that, in the writer's
opinion, Miracles are impossible,--which of course must be held to be decisive of the question.

The battle against the Inspiration of the Word of GOD is reserved for the Regius Professor
of Greek; who requires for his purpose twice the space of any of his fellows. His method is
also of the simplest kind, when divested of its many encumbrances. He simply assumes it as
proved that the Bible is a book not essentially different from Sophocles and Plato. In other
words he assumes that the Bible is not inspired; and reproaches, pities, or sneers at every
one who is not of his opinion.

In the meantime, What is Prophecy? What are Miracles? Of what sort is that Bible which has
imposed upon mankind so grossly, and so long? They are facts, and must be explained. What are
they? (p. 70.) As for Miracles, "their evidential force is wholly relative to the apprehensions
of the parties addressed ... Columbus' prediction of the Eclipse to the native islanders,"
(p. 115,) is advanced as an illustration of the nature of the argument from Miracles. By whatever
method the Bible has attained its present footing in the world, it is a book which has been
hitherto misunderstood; and it must plainly be dealt with after a new fashion. Our Lord's Incarnation,
Temptation, Death and Burial, Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven,--all His Miracles, in
short, will be best interpreted Ideologically; in other words, by a principle "which resolves
into an ideal the whole of the historical and doctrinal person of JESUS." (p. 200.) So interpreted,
"the Gospel may win again the minds of intellectual men;" (p. 376;) but it will find it no
easy matter. There is in fact "a higher wisdom" than the Gospel, "which is known to those who
are perfect,"--"that reconcilement," namely, "of Faith and Knowledge which may be termed Christian
Philosophy." (p. 413.)

The great object, in short, is to bring about "a reconciliation" (p. 375,) between "the minds
of intellectual men" (p. 376,) and Christianity. Such a reconciliation is to be regarded as
a "restoration of belief." (p. 375.) And it is to be effected by "taking away some of the external
supports, because they are not needed and do harm: also because they interfere with the meaning."
(p. 375.)--Those "external supports" are (1) a belief in the Inspiration of the Bible;--(2)
the writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church;--(3) Creeds and the decisions of Councils;--(4)
the works of Anglican Divines;--(5) Learning; (p. 337;)--(6) a profound acquaintance with the
Greek language; (p. 393;)--(7) a minute knowledge of Greek Grammar; (p. 391;)--(8) the Doctrine
of the Greek Article;--(9) the free use of the parallel passages.... The Bible, when interpreted
by any self-relying young man who knows a little Greek, and attends to the meaning of words,--will
be seen in all the freshness of its early beauty, like an old picture which has been recently
cleaned. "A new interest" will be excited by this new Bible, which will "make for itself a
new kind of authority." By being thus literally interpreted, it will be transformed into "a
spirit." Then, (but not before) the Bible will enjoy the sublime satisfaction of keeping pace
with the Age. It may so, even yet, "embrace the thoughts of men upon the earth."

But what kind of thing will this Bible be? The volume of Prophecy will have to be regarded
as a volume of History. The very History will have to be read with distrust. Like other records,
it is subject to the conditions of "knowledge which existed in an early stage of the world."
(p. 411.) It does not even begin to be authentic, until B.C. 1900; or rather, until B.C. 900[241].
What remains is to be looked upon as "the continuous witness in all ages of the higher things
in the heart of man," (p. 375,)--(whatever that may happen to mean.) The Gospel is to be looked
upon as "a life of CHRIST in the soul, instead of a theory of CHRIST which is in a book, or
written down," (p. 423.) "The lessons of Scripture, when disengaged from theological formulas,
have a nearer way to the hearts of the poor." (p. 424.) Even "in Missions to the heathen, Scripture
is to be treated as the expression of universal truths, rather than of the tenets of particular
men and Churches." (p.423.) It is anticipated that this "would remove many obstacles to the
reception of Christianity." (Ibid.) "It is not the Book of Scripture which we should seek to
give the heathen;" "but the truth of the Book; the mind of CHRIST and His Apostles, in which
all lesser details and differences should be lost and absorbed;" "the purer light or element
of Religion, of which Christianity is the expression." (p. 427.) ... Such is the ghostly phantom,
by the aid of which the Heathen are to become evangelized!

But this historical Bible is not to be regarded as the rule of a man's life, or indeed as an
external Law at all. (pp. 36, 45.) "We walk now by Reason and Conscience alone." (p. 21.) The
Bible is to be identified "with the voice of Conscience," (p. 45,)--which it has "to evoke,
not to override." (p. 44.) "The principle of private judgment ... makes Conscience the supreme
interpreter." (p. 45.) Ours is "a law which is not imposed upon us by another power, but by
our own enlightened will:" (p. 35:) for the "Spirit, or Conscience" "legislates" henceforth
"without appeal except to himself." (p. 31.)

Having thus disposed of "Traditional Christianity," (p. 156,) it is not obscurely hinted that
something quite different is to be substituted in its place. And first, next to "a frank appeal
to Reason, and a frank criticism of Scripture," (p. 174,) the nature and "office of the Church
is to be properly understood." (p. 194.)

The Church then is a spontaneous development of the State, as "part of its own organization,"
(p. 195,)--a purely secular Institution. The State will "develop itself into a Church" by "throwing
its elements, or the best of them, into another mould; and constituting out of them a Society,
which is in it, though in some sense not of it (?),--which is another (?), yet the same." (p.
194.) The nation must provide, from time to time, that the teaching of one age does "not traditionally
harden, so as to become an exclusive barrier in a subsequent one; and so the moral growth of
those who are committed to the hands of the Church be checked." (Ibid.) The Church is founded,
therefore, not upon "the possession of a supernaturally communicated speculation (!) concerning
GOD," but "upon the manifestation of a Divine Life in Man." "Speculative doctrines should be
left to philosophical schools. A national Church must be concerned with the ethical development
of its members." These may be retained indeed; but "we refuse to be bound by them." (p. 44.)
The Subscription of the Clergy to the Articles should also be abolished: for "no promise can
reach fluctuations of opinion, and personal conviction." (!!!) Open heretical teaching may,
to be sure, be dealt with by the Law; but the Law "should not require any act which appears
to signify 'I think.'" (p. 189.) Witness "the reluctance of the stronger minds to enter an
Order in which their intellects may not have free play." (p. 190.) ... Such then is the Negative
Religion! Such is the new faith which Doctors Temple and Williams, Professors Powell and Jowett,
Messieurs Wilson, Goodwin, and Pattison, have deliberately combined to offer to the acceptance
of the World!

It is high time to conclude. I cannot lay down my pen however until I have re-echoed the sentiments
of one with whom I heartily agree. I allude to Dr. Moberly; who professes that he is "struck
almost more with what seems to him the hardheartedness, and exceeding unkindness of this book,
than with its unsoundness. Have the writers," (he asks,) "considered how far the suggesting
of innumerable doubts,--doubts unargued and unproved,--will check honest devotion, and embolden
timid sin? For whom do they intend this book? Is it written for the mass of general readers?
Is it designed for students at the Universities? Do they suppose that this multitude of random
suggestions will be carefully wrought out by these readers, and be rejected if unsound; so
as to leave their faith and devotion untarnished?... Have they reflected how many souls for
whom CHRIST died may be slain in their weakness by their self-styled strength?"

"Suppose, for a moment, that the Holy Scriptures are (p. 177,) the Word of the Spirit of GOD,--that
the Miracles, (cf. p. 109,) including the Resurrection of CHRIST, are actual objective facts,
which have really happened,--that the Doctrines of the Church are true, (p. 195,) and the Creeds
(p. 355,) the authoritative expositions of them,--and that men are to reach Salvation through
faith in CHRIST, Virgin-born, according to the Scriptures, and making atonement (cf. p. 87,)
for their sins upon the Cross. ON THIS SUPPOSITION,--Is not the publication of this book an
act of real hostility to GOD'S Truth; and one which endangers the Faith and Salvation of Men?
And is this hostility less real, or the danger diminished, because the writers are, all but
one, Clergymen, some of them Tutors and Schoolmasters; because they wear the dress, and use
the language of friends, and threaten us with bitter opposition if we do not regard them as
such[242]?"

       *       *       *       *       *

With this I lay down my pen. My last words shall be simple and affectionate, addressed solely
to yourselves.

I trace these concluding lines,--(of a work which, but for you, would never have been undertaken,)--in
a quite empty College; and in the room where we have so often and so happily met on Sunday
evenings. Can you wonder if, at the conclusion of what has proved rather a heavy task, (so
hateful to me is controversy,) my thoughts revert with affectionate solicitude to yourselves,
already scattered in all directions; and to those evenings which more, I think, than any other
thing, have gilded my College life?... In thus sending you a written farewell, and praying
from my soul that GOD may bless and keep you all, I cannot suppress the earnest entreaty that
you would remember the best words of counsel which may have at any time fallen from my lips:
that you would persevere in the daily study of the pure Book of Life; and that you would read
it, not as feeling yourselves called upon to sit in judgment on its adorable contents; but
rather, as men who are permitted to draw near; and invited to listen, and to learn, and to
live. And so farewell!... "Watch ye, stand fast in the Faith,"--nay, take it in the original,
which is far better:--Γρηγορεῖτε, στήκετε ἐν τῇ πίστει ἀνδρίζεσθε, κραταιοῦσθε. πάντα ὑμῶν
ἐν ἀγάπῃ γινέσθω. Ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ μεθ' ὑμῶν. ἡ ἀγάπη μου μετὰ πάντων ὑμῶν.

FOOTNOTES:

[19] I abstain from enumerating Dr. Temple's mistakes,--for such things do not belong to the
essence of a composition. And yet I must remark that it is hardly creditable in a Doctor of
Divinity to write as he does. "In all (!) the doctrinal disputes of the fourth and fifth centuries,
the decisive voice came from Rome. Every controversy was finally settled by her opinion, because
she alone possessed the art of framing formulas," &c. (p. 16.) Would the learned writer favour
us with a single warrant for this assertion?... At p. 9, Dr. Temple mistakes for Micah's, words
spoken 700 years before by Balaam. At p. 10, he says that "Prayer, as a regular and necessary
part of worship, first appears in the later books of the Old Testament."--His account of the
papacy is contained in the following words:--"Law was the lesson which Rome was intended to
teach the world. Hence (?) the Bishop of Rome soon became the Head of the Church. Rome was
in fact the centre of the traditions which had once governed the world; and their spirit still
remained; and the Roman Church developed into the papacy simply because a head was wanted (!),
and no better one could be found."--p. 16. At p. 10 we have a truly puerile misconception of
the meaning of 1 Cor. xv. 56, &c., &c.

of the extreme wickedness of his countrymen, in connexion with the horrors of the siege of
Jerusalem,) "and it is this: I suppose that if the Romans had delayed to come against these
sinners, either the earth would have swallowed them up; or the city would have been swept away
by another Flood; or it would have been consumed, like a second Sodom, by fire from Heaven."

[30] S. John xii. 38-40. "They have blinded their eyes," &c. (See the place in the LXX.:) sc.
ὁ λαὸς οὗτος.

[31] "Had the revelation of CHRIST been delayed till now, assuredly it would have been hard
for us to recognize His Divinity.... We, of course, have in our turn counterbalancing advantages.
(!) If we have lost that freshness of faith which would be the first (sic) to say to a poor
carpenter,--Thou art the CHRIST, the SON of the living GOD,--yet we possess in the greater
cultivation of our religious understanding, that which perhaps we ought not to be willing to
give in exchange (!) ... They had not the same clearness of understanding as we; the same recognition
that it is GOD and not the Devil who rules the World; the same power of discrimination between
different kinds of truth.... Had our LORD come later, He would have come to mankind already
beginning to stiffen into the fixedness of maturity.... The truth of His Divine Nature would
not have been recognized." (pp. 24-5.)--Is this meant for bitter satire on the age we live
in; or for disparagement of the Incarnate WORD?... But in the face of such anticipations, the
keenest satire of all is contained in the author's claim to a "religious understanding, cultivated"
to a degree unknown to the best ages of the Church; as well as to surpassing "clearness of
understanding," and "powers of discrimination." Lamentable in any quarter, how deplorable is
such conceit in one who shews himself unacquainted with the first principles of Theological
Science; and who puts forth an Essay on the Education of the World, which would have been discreditable
to an advanced school-boy!

[32] Quite ineffectual, at the very close of this unhappy composition, as a set off to the
compacted and often repeated asseverations of his earlier pages, is the amiable author's plaintive
plea for "even the perverted use of the Bible;" adding,--"And meanwhile, how utterly impossible
it would be in the manhood of the world to imagine any other instructor of mankind!" (p. 47.)
It is one of the favourite devices of these seven writers, side by side with their most objectionable
statements, to insert isolated passages of admitted truth,--and occasionally even of considerable
beauty: which however are utterly meaningless and out of place where they stand; and (like
the sentence above written,) powerless to undo the circumstantial wickedness of what went before.
I repeat, that the words above-written are meaningless where they stand: for if Dr. Temple
really means that it is "utterly impossible in the manhood of the world to IMAGINE any other
instructor of mankind" than THE BIBLE,--what becomes of his Essay?

of Virtue."--Let us hear our own Hooker on this subject:--"We find by experience that although
Faith be an intellectual habit of the mind, and have her seat in the understanding, yet an
evil moral disposition obstinately wedded to the love of darkness dampeth the very light of
heavenly illumination, and permitted not the Mind to see what doth shine before it."--Eccl.

[87] "The horizon which his view embraced was much narrower than St. Paul's,"--who had enlarged
his mind by foreign travel, (p. 168.)

In a note, we are informed that "at any rate his Gospel cannot, by external evidence, be attached
to the person (!) of St. John as its author." "Many persons," (it is added,) "shrink from a
bonâ fide examination of the 'Gospel question,' because they imagine, that unless the four
Gospels are received as ... entirely the composition of the persons whose names they bear,
and without any admixture of legendary matter or embellishment in their narratives, the only
alternative is to suppose a fraudulent design in those who did compose them." (p. 161.) ...
May one who has not shrunk from 'the Gospel question' be permitted to regret that the Reverend
writer has not specified the charges which he thus vaguely brings against the Gospels? What,
pray, is the legendary matter; and which are the embellishments?

In the same page we read of "the first, or genuine, epistle of St. Peter." Is not his second
epistle genuine, then?

to leave her."--Rev. C. Forster's 'Spinoza Redivivus,' (1861,) p. 6.

[90] In what part of the Bible, (one begs respectfully to inquire,) is one called upon to "accept
the story of an arresting of the Earth's motion, or of a reversal of its motion?" ... Would
it not be as well to be truthful in one's references to the Bible?

[94] Take a few as a specimen:--"A great restraint is supposed to be imposed upon the Clergy
by reason of their subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles. Yet it is more difficult than
might be expected, to define what is the extent of the legal obligation of those who sign them;
and in this case, the strictly legal obligation is the measure of the moral one. Subscription
may be thought even to be inoperative upon the conscience by reason of its vagueness. For the
act of subscription is enjoined, but its effect or meaning nowhere plainly laid down; and it
does not seem to amount to more than an acceptance of the Articles of the Church as the formal
law to which the subscriber is in some sense subject. What that subjection amounts to, must
be gathered elsewhere; for it does not appear on the face of the subscription itself."--(p.
181. See down to page 185.) Can equivocation such as this be read without a sense of humiliation
and shame, as well as of disgust and abhorrence?

[97] The reader is referred to some remarks on Ideology towards the close of Sermon VII., p.
243 to p. 251.

[98] "Unhappily, together with his inauguration of Multitudinism, Constantine also inaugurated
a principle essentially at variance with it, the principle of doctrinal limitation." (p. 166.)
... "The opportunity of reverting to the freedom of the Apostolic, and immediately succeeding
periods, was finally lost for many ages by the sanction given by Constantine to the decisions
of Nicæa." (Ibid.) "At all events, a principle at variance with a true Multitudinism was then
recognised." (Ibid.)

How does it happen, by the way, that one writing B.D. after his name, however bitter his animosity
against the Nicene Creed may be, is not aware that Creeds are co-eval with Christianity? Thus
we find the Creed of Carthage in the works of Cyprian, (A.D. 225,) and Tertullian, (A.D. 210,
203): that of Lyons in the works of Irenæus, (A.D. 180.) [see Heurtley's Harmonia Symbolica,
pp. 7-20.] We recognize fragments of the Creed in Ignatius, (A.D. 90.) We hear St. Paul himself
saying--ὑποτύπωσιν ἔχε ὑγιαινόντων λόγων, ὧν (i.e. the words themselves!) παρ' ἐμοῦ ἤκουσας
... τὴν καλὴν παρακαταθήκην φύλαξον--2 Tim. i. 13, 14. A few more words on this subject will
be found in the notice of Mr. Jowett's Essay. (p. 177.)

[100] Quarterly Review, (Jan. 1851,) No. 217, p. 259.

[101] A writer in the Saturday Review, (April 6, 1861,) in an admirable Article on the importance
of retaining the office of 'Dean' in its integrity, (instead of suicidally merging it in the
office of 'Bishop,') speaks of there being "no English Commentary on the New Testament brought
up to the level of modern Theological Science." [As if "the level" had been rising of late!]
"Butler and Paley are still our text-books on the Evidences; and we are defending old beliefs
behind wooden walls against the rifled cannon and iron broadsides of modern Philosophy."--p.
337. What a strange misapprehension of the entire question,--of the relation of Theological
to Physical Science,--does such a sentence betray!

[102] See below, p. 235.

[103] As the excellent Townson observed long since,--"The brightness of countenance and raiment
which dazzled and overcame the sight of His Apostles when He was Transfigured on the Mount,
was to Him but a ray of that glory in which He dwelt before the Worlds were made."--Sermon
on "The manner of our SAVIOUR'S Teaching,"--Works, vol. i. p. 282.

[104] St. Matth. xvii. 2.

[105] St. Mark ix. 3.

[106] 1 Tim. vi. 15, 16.--If it be more philosophical to suppose that the Light which shone
upon the earth during the first three days proceeded from the Sun, (the orb of which remained
invisible,) and not from any extraneous independent source,--I have no objection whatever to
such a supposition,--or indeed to any other which suffers the inspired record to remain intact.
I am by no means clear however that Philosophy (begging her pardon,) does not entirely mistake
her office, when she pretends to explain the first chapter of Genesis. Hence, her constrained
language, and unnatural manner, when she desires to be respectful,--her inconsequential remarks
and perpetual blunders when she rather prefers to be irreligious. She is simply out of her
element, and is discoursing of what she does not understand.--Theology, dealing with a physical
problem by the method of Theological Science; and Philosophy, applying to a chapter in the
Bible the physical method,--are alike at fault, and alike ridiculous. This truth, however obvious,
does not seem to be generally understood.

But, (to return to the first three days of Creation,)--since the Author of Revelation seems
to design that I should understand that Sun, Moon, and Stars not only did not come to view
until the fourth day,--but also that they were not re-invested with their immemorial function
and office until then,--I find no difficulty, remembering with whom I have to do, even with
Him who sowed the vault of Heaven so thick with stars, each one of which may be not a sun but
a system[107];--when, I say, I attend to the emphatic nature of the inspired record, on the
one hand, and to GOD'S Omnipotence on the other,--I have no difficulty in supposing that He
embraced the Sun in a veil, for just so long a period as it seemed Him good, and when He willed
that it should re-appear, that He withdrew the veil again. The name for the operation just
now alluded to belongs to the province of Philosophy. Divinity is all the while thinking about
something infinitely better and higher.

[126] "The difficulty," he says, (alluding to Gen. i. 1,) "lies in this, that the heaven is
distinctly said to have been formed ... on the second day." (p. 226.) But this is the language
of a man determined that there shall be a difficulty. "The Heavens and the Earth" clearly denote,
(in the simple phraseology of a primitive age,) the sum of all created things; the great transaction
which Nehemiah has so strikingly expounded:--"Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens, with all their
host,--the Earth and all things that are therein;" including "the sea, with all that is therein."
(Neh. ix. 6.) Whereas "the firmament" of ver. 6, (which GOD called "Heaven" in ver. 8,) can
only indicate the blue vault immediately overhead, wherein fowls fly. (ver. 20.) If this be
not the meaning of Gen. i. 1, one half of the phrase is "proleptical,"--the other half not:
for the creation of Earth is nowhere recorded, if not in ver. 1.... But surely it is a waste
of words to discuss such "difficulties" as these.

[128] "There have been found within the area of these islands upwards of 15,000 species of

Greenland,) he has not found any creature of this class, in all the Geological strata, identical
with any fish now living." (p. 249.) "For ages, this simple view of Creation satisfied the
wants of man, and formed a sufficient basis of theological teaching:" but "modern research
now shews it to be physically untenable." (p. 253.)

"The writer asserts solemnly and unhesitatingly that for which he must have known that he had

[147] Nor is this a mere slip of Mr. Jowett's pen. At p. 372, he states that "a majority of
the Clergy throughout the world,"--(with whom he associates the "instincts of many laymen,
perhaps also individual interest,")--are in favour of "withholding the Truth." But, he adds,
(with the indignant emphasis of Virtue when she is reproaching Vice,)--"a higher expediency
pleads that 'honesty is the best policy,' and that truth alone 'makes free!'"--How would such
insolence be treated in the common intercourse of daily life?--(I will not pause to remark
on Mr. Jowett's wanton abuse of the Divine saying recorded in St. John viii. 32,--repeated
at p. 351.)

[148] I suppose that there may have been many inspired Psalmists; and that perhaps the book

[150] "It is remarkable that the word Γραφή, which means simply Writing, is reserved and appropriated

all other writings in the world."--Wordsworth 'On Inspiration,'--p. 85.

[208] From a Sermon by the Rev. F. Woodward, quoted below, at p. 249.--In illustration of the
learned writer's concluding remark, take this from the Creed of Lyons, contained in Irenæus
(A.D. 180),--Καὶ εἰς Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον, τὸ διὰ τῶν Προφητῶν κεκηρυχὸς τὰς οἰκονομίας, καὶ τὰς ἐλεύσεις.
In the Creed of Constantinople, we read, Τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον ... τὸ λαλῆσαν διὰ τῶν Προφητῶν.

[209] The Creed of Lyons begins by describing itself as that which ἡ μὲν Ἐκκλησία, καίπερ καθ'
ὅλης τῆς οἰκουμένης ἕως περάτων τῆς γῆς διεσπαρμένη, παρὰ δὲ τῶν Ἀποστόλων καὶ τῶν ἐκείνων
μαθητῶν παραλαβοῦσα, κ.τ.λ. Most refreshing of all, however, are the concluding words of that
Creed: so comfortable are they that I cannot deny myself the consolation of transcribing them
here, where indeed they are very much ad rem:--

Τοῦτο τὸ κήρυγμα παρειληφυῖα, καὶ ταύτην τὴν πίστιν, ὡς προέφαμεν, ἡ ἐκκλησία, καίπερ ἐν ὅλῳ
τῷ κόσμῳ διεσπαρμένη, ἐπιμελῶς φυλάσσει, ὡς ἕνα οἶκον οἰκοῦσα· καὶ ὁμοίως πιστεύει τούτοις,
ὡς μίαν ψυχὴν καὶ τὴν αὐτὴν ἔχουσα καρδίαν· καὶ συμφώνως ταῦτα κηρύσσει, καὶ διδάσκει, καὶ
παραδίδωσιν, ὡς ἓν στόμα κεκτημένη. Καὶ γὰρ αἱ κατὰ τὸν κόσμον διάλεκτοι ἀνόμοιαι, ἀλλ' ἡ δύναμις

[212] Answer. He certainly does not employ the identical language of the Nicene Council, or
of the (so called) Athanasian Creed. But what then?

[213] Ans. Passages of the Epistles "distributed in alternate clauses between our Lord's Humanity
and Divinity," begging Mr. Jowett's pardon, is nonsense. But no passage in St. Paul's Epistles
which relates to the Humanity, or to the Divinity of CHRIST, could be said to "lose its meaning"
by being unlocked by its own proper clue: or, if the statement be complex, by being distributed
under two heads.

[214] Ans. But not, I suppose, to reconcile them? Why use inaccurate language on so solemn
a subject?

[215] Ans. Doubtless we have to suppose this!

[216] Ans. Not so. For "there is one Person of the FATHER, and another of the SON."

[217] Ans. Doubtless we have to suppose this!

[218] Ans. But He did not doubt!

[220] Dr. Moberly, as before, p. xlvii.

[221] E.g. "We should observe how the popular explanations of Prophecy, as in heathen (Thucyd.
ii. 54,) so also in Christian times, had adapted themselves to the circumstances of mankind."
(The Reverend writer can never for a moment divest himself of his theory that Thucydides and
the Bible stand on the same footing!) "We might remark that in our own country, and in the
present generation especially, the interpretation of Scripture had assumed an apologetic character,
as though making an effort to defend itself against some supposed inroad of Science and Criticism."
(p. 340.) ... Just as if any other attitude was possible when one has to do with 'Essayists
and Reviewers!'

[222] One would imagine that the Essayist and his critic were entirely agreed. See below, p.
74,--"I refuse to accept any theory whatsoever." And p. 115,--"Theory I have none."

[223] Had the following passage occurred sooner to my recollection, it should have been sooner
inserted:--"Are we to conduct the Interpretation of Holy Scripture as we would that of any
other writing? We are and we are not. So far as THE WORDS are concerned, the mere words of
Scripture have the same office with those of all language written or spoken in sincerity."
They must be studied "by the same means and the same rules which would guide us to the meaning
of any other work; by a knowledge of the languages in which the books were written, the Hebrew,
the Chaldee, the Greek, and of those other languages, as the Syriac and Arabic, which may illustrate
them; and of all the ordinary rules of Grammar and Criticism, and the peculiar information
respecting times and circumstances, history and customs,--all the resources, in a word, of
the Interpretation of any work of any kind. The Grammatical and Historical interpretation of
profane or sacred writings is the same.... "All Scripture," meanwhile, "is given by Inspiration
of GOD:" and this at once introduces several important differences; which whoever neglects
may yet, with whatsoever advantages of learning and talent, fail to discover the real meaning
of the Word of GOD."--From Dr. Hawkins (Provost of Oriel)'s Inaugural Lecture as Dean Ireland's
Professor, delivered in 1847,--pp. 29-30.

It is but fair to Mr. Jowett to add that, in terms, he has very nearly (not quite) said the
self-same thing himself, at p. 337, (upper half the page.) But it is the peculiar method of
this most slippery writer, or most illogical thinker, occasionally to grant almost all that
heart can desire, as far as words go; but straightway to deny, or evacuate, or explain away,
the thing which those words ought to signify.--Thus, at p. 337, he volunteers the remark that
"No one who has a Christian feeling would place Classical on a level with Sacred Literature;"
and at p. 377, he observes that, "There are many respects in which Scripture is unlike any
other book." And yet, (as I have shown, p. cxliii. to p. cl.,) Mr. Jowett puts the Bible on
a level with Sophocles and Plato; and argues throughout as if Scripture were in no essential
respect unlike any other book!

[224] "Had this writer reminded us that the New Testament Greek is a Greek of different age
from that of the classical writers; had he simply warned us that we must not press our Attic
Greek scholarship too far, but study the Alexandrian Greek of the Septuagint, Philo, &c. in
order to ascertain the exact meaning of the words and phrases of the writers of the New Testament;--still
more, if, as the result of such study on his own part, he had offered us some well-digested
observations on the use of tenses, articles, or particles in the sacred writings;--he would
have done some service. But this talk about 'excessive attention to the article,' and 'particles
being often mere excrescences of style,' is of no effect except to expose the writer to ridicule.
It sounds as if he had been accustomed to lay down the law to an admiring audience of 'clever
young men,' and had forgotten that there were still 'men in Denmark' who understood Greek."--Some

cannot, in a scientific and literary age, be effectually and cordially attached to the Church
of their nation, they must sooner or later be driven into a position of hostility to it." (p.

the individual, pp. 45 and 83:--dwell on the "interpolations" in Scripture, pp. 47 and 78.--Mr.
Wilson and Mr. Jowett insist on the meaning which Scripture had to those who first heard it,
as its true meaning, pp. 219, 223, 230, 232, and 338, 378:--on the necessity of reconciling
Intellectual men to Scripture, pp. 198 and 374.--Professor Powell and Mr. Jowett are of one

mind as to the past training of our Race, pp. 1-49, and 51. They are generally agreed as to
the untrustworthiness of Genesis, and of the Scripture generally, the hopeless contradictions
between the Evangelists, &c., &c. They hold the same language about our having outlived the
Faith, ('Traditional Christianity,' as it is called;) the impossibility of freedom of thought;

THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE RECOMMENDED; AND A METHOD OF STUDYING IT DESCRIBED.

It was probably in that synagogue which the faithful Centurion built at Capernaum[244] that
our SAVIOUR had been discoursing. At the end of His discourse, it is related that "many of
His Disciples went back, and walked no more with Him." Thereupon, He asked the Twelve, "Will
ye also go away?" the very form of His inquiry (Μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς) implying the answer which the
Divine Speaker expected and desired. And to this challenge of Love to Faith, St. Peter replied,
not only on behalf of his fellow-Apostles, but on behalf of all faithful men to the end of
time:--"LORD, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of Eternal Life!"

You perceive that St. Peter's confession takes a peculiar form,--resting the impossibility
of unfaithfulness in the Apostles on the gracious discourse of Him to whom they had been listening.
"A hard saying," and unpalatable, it had proved to many; but to his own taste it had seemed
"sweeter than honey and the honeycomb." So that while, to those others, it had been an occasion
of going back, and walking with CHRIST no more,--to himself it had been a reason why he could
never, as he felt, be persuaded to forsake CHRIST. Nay, it was to himself, (and, as he boldly
assumed, to his fellow-Apostles,) a sufficient evidence that the Speaker was none other than
the SON of GOD. "And we believe, and are sure, that Thou art the CHRIST, the SON of the living
GOD!"

Here then, surely, a very solemn picture is set before us. The same message proves, in the
case of some, the savour of death unto death: in the case of others, of life unto life. It
is an image of what is still taking place in the world. The Gospel, whether veiled in the Old
Testament, or unveiled in the New, is confessedly "a hard saying:"--to some, their very crown
and joy; to others, only an occasion of distress and downfall. It was so, when proclaimed not
by the tongue of men and of angels, but by the lips "full of grace and truth" of the Incarnate
WORD Himself: and it is so still. The temper of mankind is still the same as it was of old,
and the instrument of man's trial is still the same.

Of the written Gospel, many of the self-same things are said in Scripture which are said of
Him by whom that Gospel was preached. Thus, it is proclaimed to be "the power of GOD to salvation[245]."
It is described as "a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart[246]." It is declared
to be eternal,--a thing which "shall never pass away[247]." "In the last day," it is prophesied
that the words which CHRIST has spoken "shall judge" men[248]. The very Name by which St. John
designates the Eternal SON, in the forefront of his Gospel[249], is the appellation by which
the Gospel is emphatically known.--But even more remarkable are the analogies which subsist
between the written record of our LORD'S Life and Teaching, and the actual person of our LORD.
And proposing, as I now do, to say a few earnest words to the younger men in recommendation
of a more punctual, methodical, as well as attentive study of the Bible, than, I am persuaded,
is practised by one young man in a thousand,--it may not prove unavailing in awakening attention,
if I advert, in passing, to some of the circumstances whereby an even balance, (so to speak,)
is established between the opportunities of the men of this generation, and of those who were
blessed with the oral teaching of the Son of Man.

1. Thus, if the record has its difficulties, and its seeming contradictions, so had He. It
did not appear that "JESUS of Nazareth" was born, (according to the prophet Micah's prediction,)
at Bethlehem[250]. His title perplexed even Nathanael[251].--He was called the son of Joseph,
even by the Blessed Virgin[252]. How then could He be the SON of GOD? And how was the famous
prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled in Him[253]?--He grew up in a lowly estate. Once He is called
"the carpenter[254]." How then could He be of the Royal House of David? And so, in many other
respects, did He, in His own person, present the self-same class of difficulties to the world's
eye which His Gospel presents to ours:--"the sixteenth of Tiberius,"--the two genealogies,--"Cyrenius,"--"the
days of Abiathar,"--"Jeremy the prophet,"--and so on.

2. Somewhat less obvious, but not less true, is the unattractive aspect, at first sight, of
the Gospel. Verily there is, until we become intimately acquainted with it, "no beauty that
we should desire" it.--The style, (full of interest, to those who have tried to understand
it a little,) is not, I suppose, what critics would call altogether a good style.--The Greek
is not what learned men call pure.--Many a word, (brimfull of meaning to those who will give
to the words of the Gospel their best care,) reminds one, that neither did He speak what, in
the capital of Jewry, was accounted a classical idiom. He employed the accent of the despised
Galilee.--The very reasoning, (until you give it your heart's homage and best attention,) often
seems to be either inconsequential, or to contain a fallacy. Certain words of our LORD have
been even cited as fallacious by a celebrated Divine whose writings we are all familiar with[255].
Now, His words were disregarded, cavilled at, made light of, in just the same manner.

3. Most surprising of all is the analogy observable between the union of the Divine and the
human element in the Gospels,--and the strictly parallel union, as it seems, of the two natures,
the Divine and the Human, in the person of our LORD.--As He was perfect and faultless, so do
we deem it infallible also, without spot or blemish of any kind. We reject as monstrous any
'theory of Inspiration,' (as it is called,) which imputes blunders to the work of the HOLY
GHOST.--As, further, we claim for our LORD'S recorded human actions mysterious significancy,
so do we seem warranted in looking for a mysterious purpose, a divine meaning, in every expression
of the written Word.--Lastly, although we may, nay we must, admit such a Divine and such a
human element, we must altogether deny the possibility of separating the one from the other.
We cannot separate Scripture into human and Divine. Like the Incarnate WORD, the Gospel is
at once both human and Divine, yet one and indivisible. And the method of its inspiration is
as great a difficulty in its way, and as much beyond our ken, as the nature of the union of
the Godhead and the Manhood in the one person of CHRIST.

For whatever reason, and whether you please to accept the foregoing remarks or not, it is a
plain fact that the Gospel is now in the world, fulfilling the same office towards mankind,
which our Saviour CHRIST Himself fulfilled, and experiencing the same treatment at the hands
of men in return. It is leavening society indeed, and remodelling the world, even while it
is practically overlooked by politicians or experiencing evil treatment from them. It wins
its way silently and secretly, yet surely; and it works miracles here and there. Moreover,
it divides opinion; separating, as it will for ever separate, the light from the darkness[256].
It is slighted, and overlooked, and neglected by some; even while, by others, it is embraced
with joy unspeakable. 'The humble and meek' adore it; even while, by the proud and rebellious,
it is after a most strange fashion cavilled at, called in question, and denied. We specify
the Gospel, instinctively, as that part of the Inspired Word which chiefly concerns ourselves,
as Christian men; but the entire deposit shares the same fate. I do not think I am delivering
a paradox when I say that the Bible is generally very little read. That the amount of study
commonly bestowed upon it bears no proportion whatever to its transcendent importance and paramount
value, shall not be any paradox at all; but a mere truism.

For I entreat you to consider, (trite and obvious as it may sound,) What have we, in the whole
wide world, which may be put in competition with that Book which contains GOD'S revelation
of Himself to man? In its early portions, how does it go back to the very birthday of Time,
and discourse of things which were done in the grey of that early morning! How mysterious is
the record,--so methodical, so particular, so unique; preserving the very words which were
syllabled in Paradise, and describing transactions which no one but the HOLY GHOST is competent
to declare! Come lower down, and where will you find more beautiful narratives,--still fresh
at the end of three and four thousand years,--than those stories of Patriarchs, Judges, Kings,
which wrap up divinest teaching in all their ordinary details: where every word is weighed
in a heavenly balance, fraught with a divine purpose, and intended for some glorious issue:
where the very characters are adumbrations of personages far greater than themselves; and where
the course of events is made to preach to us, at this distant day, of the things which concern
our peace! Is it a light thing again to know in what terms Isaiah, and the rest of "the goodly
fellowship," when they opened their lips to speak in that remote age, foretold of the coming
of the Son of Man?... But all seems to grow pale before the Everlasting Gospel, and the other
writings of the New Testament. Surely we have become too familiar with the providence which
has preserved to us the very words of the four Evangelists, if we can bend our thoughts in
the direction of the Gospel without a throb of joy and wonder not to be described, at having
so great a treasure placed within our easy reach. Can it indeed be, that I may listen while
the disciple whom JESUS loved is discoursing of the miracles, and recalling the sayings of
his LORD? May I hear St. Peter himself address the early Church,--or know the precise words
of the message which St. Jude sent to the first believers,--or be shown the Epistle which the
LORD'S cousin addressed "to the Twelve Tribes scattered abroad"? How does it happen that the
Book is not for ever in our hands which comes to us with such claims to our undivided homage?

But, on the contrary, it has become the fashion in certain quarters, on every imaginable pretext,
to call in question the credibility of the Bible. It seems to be the taste of the age to invent
hazy difficulties and dim objections to its statements. Inspiration, under a miserable attempt
to explain it, is openly explained away. And the theory, however crude and preposterous, is
tolerated: at least it escapes castigation. It cannot fail but that the unlearned and thoughtless
ones of this generation will be growing up in a notion that these are open questions after
all, and that "Truth" is but a name,--not a thing worth contending, aye dying for, if need
be! The reason is but too obvious. It must be, partly, because we do not in reality prize the
deposit nearly so much as we suppose. Partly, because of the indifferentism which is everywhere
so prevalent. Partly too because, notwithstanding our intellectual activity, we are not a really
learned body. And partly, it must be confessed, the reason is, because Theology has become
so nearly a prostrate study with us, and because men really able to do battle for the Truth
are somewhat hard to find. Nor is there any reasonable prospect of improvement either; for
those who go forth from this place into the Ministry, go with such slender preparation, that
it would be truer to say that they go with none at all.

Now, it would be a mere waste of time, to inveigh for half an hour against the indifferentism,
or the spurious liberality, of the age: and it would be a most unbecoming proceeding, (not
to say a highly distasteful one,) from this place to be suggesting remedies for an evil which
already lies very near the heart of every serious man among us; and which, if discussed at
all, must be discussed elsewhere. To say the truth, while the neglect of Theology, and the
low ebb of Theological attainments in our Clergy, is generally recognized, the remedy for the
evil is by no means so clear. From this subject, then, I pass at once: and I shall content
myself with the far humbler task, of urging upon the younger men present,--those especially
who are destined for the Ministry,--one act of preparation, one duty, about which, at all events,
there cannot be any difference of opinion: I mean the duty of applying themselves, now, to
the patient study of the Bible.

The thing is soon said; but the hint requires expanding a little, in order that it may become
of any practical use.--By the "study of the Bible," I do not mean a chapter occasionally read
with care: nor even a chapter regularly conned over at night; when a convivial meeting has
blunted the edge of observation, or severe study has exhausted the powers of the brain. The
devotional use of a portion of Holy Scripture is quite a distinct affair. Still less would
the practice satisfy me of following the lessons in the College Chapel: and this for reasons
so obvious that I will not stop to point them out. Nor even is the reading of the Bible in
College Lecture, the thing I mean; for reasons also which any acute person will readily ascertain
for himself. None of these methods of acquainting yourselves with the contents of the Bible
come up to the thing I contemplate, although each is good in its way; and of course I am not
speaking in disparagement of any.

No. The thing I would so strenuously urge upon you, is,--that, during your undergraduate period,
you should read the whole Bible consecutively through, from one end to the other, by yourself
and for yourself, with consummate method, care, and attention. The fundamental conditions of
such a study of the Bible, in order to make it of any real use, are these:--

1. First, that you should deliberately apportion to this solemn duty the best and freshest
and quietest half-hour in the whole day; and then, that you should determine, let what will
go undone, never to abridge that half-hour. You may sometimes be enabled to afford a little
more time to the chapter: but you will find it quite fatal ever to devote a shorter period
to it. And half an hour, if you employ it in right good earnest, at present, must be thought
enough.

2. Next, (except on Sundays and in Vacation, when you may safely double your daily task and
your daily time,) be persuaded to read each day exactly one chapter. On no account attempt
to go reading on; but rather spend the moments which remain over, (they cannot be many!) in
reviewing that day's portion; or referring to some of the places indicated in the margin; or
glancing over yesterday's chapter.

The effect of building up your Bible knowledge in this manner, bit by bit, is what you would
not anticipate. The whole acquires a solidity and compactness not to be attained by any other
method. You will find at the end of many days, not only that the structure has attained to
symmetry and beauty,--but that the disposition of its several parts, in some respects, has
become intelligible also: while, (what is not of least importance,) the foundation on which
all the superstructure rests, proves wondrous secure and strong.

3. Then, while you read,--safe from the risk of interruption, (as I began by supposing,) and
with every faculty intent on your task,--try, as much as possible, to go over the words as
if they were new to you; and watch them, one by one, so that nothing may by any possibility
escape your notice. Do not slumber over a single word. Nothing can be unimportant when it is
the HOLY GHOST who speaketh. It is an excellent practice to mark the expressions which strike
you; for it is a method of preserving the memory of what is sure else soon to pass away.

4. And next, be persuaded to read without extraneous helps of any kind; except, of course,
such help as a map, or the margin of your Bible, supplies. Pray avoid Commentaries and notes.
First, you cannot afford time for them: and secondly, if you could, they would be as likely
to mislead you as not. But the real reason why you are so strenuously advised to avoid them,
is, because they will do more to nullify your reading, than anything which could be imagined.
Your object is to obtain an insight into Holy Scripture, by acquiring the habit of reading
it with intelligence and care: not to be saved trouble, and to be shown what other persons
have thought about it.

5. But then, though you are entreated not to have recourse to the notes of others, you are
as strongly advised to make brief memoranda of your own: and the briefer the better. Construct
your own table of the Patriarchs,--your own analysis of the Law,--your own descent of the Kings,--your
own enumeration of the Miracles. A pedigree full of faults, made by yourself, will do you more
good than the most accurate table drawn up by another: but if you are at all attentive and
clever, it will not be full of faults.--You will perhaps make the parables 56 instead of 30:
you will have gained 26 by your honest industry. Nay, keep a record of your difficulties, if
you please; or of anything which strikes you, and which you would be sorry to forget. But,
as a rule, it is well to write little, and to give your time and thought to the record before you.

6. Above all, is it indispensable that your reading of the Bible should be strictly consecutive;
and on no account may any one pretend to begin such a study of that book as I am here recommending,
except at the first Chapter of Genesis. It is a great mistake, (though one of the commonest
of all,) for a man to imagine that he knows the beginning of the Bible pretty well. I say it
advisedly, that it would be easy to write down twelve interesting questions on that first chapter,
of which none of the younger men present would be able to answer three,--and yet, they should
all be questions of such a sort that a labouring man's child with an open Bible would be able
infallibly to answer them every one.

7. It will follow from what has been offered, that you are invited to read every book in the
Bible in the order in which it actually stands,--never, of course, skipping a chapter; much
less a Book. In every mere catalogue of names, be resolved to find edification. Feel persuaded
that details, seemingly the driest, are full of GOD. Remember that the difference between every
syllable of Scripture and all other books in the world is, not a difference of degree, but
of kind. All books but one, are human: that one book is Divine!

Now, you will perceive that the kind of study of the Bible here recommended, is somewhat different
from what is commonly pursued. I contemplate the continued exercise of a most curious and prying,
as well as a most vigilant and observing eye. No difficulty is to be neglected; no peculiarity
of expression is to be disregarded; no minute detail is to be overlooked. The hint let fall
in an earlier chapter is to be compared with a hint let fall in the later place. Do they tally
or not? and what follows? The chronological details spontaneously evolved by the narrative,
are to be unerringly discovered by the student for himself. The course of every journey is
to be attentively noted. Things omitted are to be spied out as carefully as things set down;
and whatever can possibly be gathered in the way of necessary inference, is to be industriously
ascertained. The imagination is not to slumber either, because no pains are taken by the sacred
writer to move the feelings or melt the heart.

How soon will any one who takes the trouble to read the Bible after this fashion, be struck
with a hundred things which he never knew before,--indeed, which are not commonly known! How
will he be for ever eliciting unsuspected facts,--detecting undreamed of coincidences, but
which are as important as they are true,--accumulating materials of value quite inestimable
for future study in Divine things! However unpromising a certain collection of references may
be, he is careful to extend it,--convinced, like a wise householder, that there will come an
use for it after many days. His whole aim is to master thoroughly the record which he has undertaken
to study.

Let me not be misunderstood if it is added that the Bible should be read,--I do not say in
the same manner,--that is, in the same temper and spirit,--but at least with the same attention,
as is bestowed upon a merely human work. In truth, it should be read with much more attention.
So do I. Scripture is to be approached and handled in quite a different spirit from a common
history. The mind, the heart rather, must bow down before its revelations, in the most suppliant
fashion imaginable. The book should ever be approached with prayer:--"LORD, open Thou mine
eyes that I may see the wondrous things of Thy Law!" The very printed pages should be handled
with reverence, in consideration of the message they contain. But what I am saying is, that
none of the methods which diligence and zeal have ever invented to secure a complete mastery
of the contents of any merely human performance, may be overlooked by a student of the Bible.

To what has gone before I will add one caution, and will trouble you with one only. It would
be easy to multiply cautions: but I am talking to highly intelligent men; and there is only
one rock which I am really fearful of your running against.

It was the advice of a great and good man, (to his clergy, I suspect,) that they should read
the Bible with a special object: and an excellent recent writer has repeated the same advice;
namely that men should "read with a view to some particular inquiry, with purpose to clear
up some peculiar question of interest, which," (says he,) "you may create for yourselves[257]."
I entreat you to do nothing of the kind. Whatever advantages may result to an advanced student
from adopting this practice, to you it must be fraught with unmingled evil. You will be tempted
to overrate the importance of everything you discover which suits your present purpose: you
will disregard all that looks in a different direction: you will be disappointed if you meet
with nothing ad rem: you will get a habit of slurring over many chapters, many whole books
of the Bible. A very little reflection will convince you that it must be as I say. Who, for
example, could be expected to find delight and edification in the calendar of the Deluge, who
had determined to read Genesis with a view to discovering what knowledge existed in the patriarchal
age of a future life? No. Your wisdom will be to divest your minds, as much as possible, of
any preconceived notion as to what the Bible contains, or was intended to teach you. You should
wish to find there nothing so much as the authentic evidence of what Divine Wisdom hath seen
fit to communicate to man. Read it therefore, if you are wise, with unaffected curiosity: settling
down upon every flower, in order to find out, if you can, where the honey is: clinging to it
rather, until you have found the honey. Say to yourself,--"It cannot be that all these details
of months and days should be given in vain[258]. I must find out the reason of it." And, at
last, you will find,--what you will find.--"Very strange," (you will learn to say to yourself,)
"that the history of nearly 1600 years should be curdled into one short chapter[259]; and yet
that three verses of the Bible should be devoted to the history of a man's losing his way in
a field, and then finding it again[260]!" The subject may be worth thinking about. You are
perhaps naturally disposed to take what you are pleased to call "a common sense view" of the
meaning of Holy Scripture; and to interpret it after a very dry unlovely fashion of your own:
to evacuate its deeper sayings, and to doubt the mysterious significancy of its historical
details. You will speedily perceive, however, that the Apostles and Evangelists of CHRIST,--as
many as were moved by the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD, and spoke not their own words but His,--that
all these are against you: and the effect of this discovery on an honest and good heart, reading
not in order to be confirmed in some preconceived opinion, but with a sincere desire of enlightenment
in Divine things,--may be anticipated. Bishop Horsley relates that by a yet simpler process
he became disabused of a favourite fancy with which he set out,--namely, that prophecy must
of necessity carry a single meaning[261].--The attitude of mind which I so strongly recommend
you to assume, (and it depends on an act of the Will, whether you assume it or not,) is very
exactly represented by the cry of the child Samuel,--"Speak LORD, for Thy servant heareth!"

It seems right, in the fewest words, to state what we do,--and what we do not,--expect to result
from such a study of the Bible as this; in other words, to assign the office of unassisted
Biblical study. I would not willingly have my meaning mistaken here.

It is not implied then, for a moment, that a man is either at liberty, or able, to gather his
own Religion for himself out of the Bible. The very thought were monstrous. But it is a widely
different thing for one of yourselves to read his Bible patiently, and humbly, and laboriously,
through,--without prejudice or theory,--unmolested by critical notes, undistracted by human
comments, uninfluenced by party views:--all this, I say, is a widely different thing from a
man's inventing his own system of Divinity. Members of the Catholic Church,--born in a Christian
country,--educated amid the choicest influences for good,--you are by no means so left to yourselves.
THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER is your sufficient safeguard. The framework of the Faith,--the conditions
under which you may lawfully speculate about Divine mysteries,--are all prescribed for you:
and within those limits you cannot well go wrong.

On the other hand, the outlines of Moral Theology, (as it may be called), you are fully competent
to detect for yourselves. GOD'S strictness in punishing sin, as in the case of Moses[262];--the
efficacy of repentance, as in the case of Ahab[263];--the sure answer to prayer, (to forgotten
prayer, it may be!) as in the case of Zacharias[264];--the seemingly roundabout methods of
GOD'S providence, (as in the case of Abraham,) yet conducting inevitably to a blessed issue
at the last;--the rewards of obedience[265];--the faithfulness of the Divine promises;--the
boundless wealth of the Divine contrivance, which, on man's repentance, is able to convert
even a curse into a blessing, as in the case of Levi[266];--the peace and joy surely in reserve
for those who fear GOD, as in the case of Joseph;--the extent to which things seemingly trivial
are noticed by the Ancient of Days, as every page of the Bible shows;--these, and a hundred
points like these, not only a man can gather for himself out of the Book of God's Law, but
no one else can do the work for him. He must discover all such matters for himself.

And need I point out, for a minute, the immense advantage with which a mind so stored with
Divine knowledge will approach the Ministry; and finally take in hand the actual oversight
of the flock? It is really not to be expressed. The Bishop's examination for Orders will become
nothing but an agreeable exercise, instead of an object of dread. You are quite sure of a few
approving words in that quarter. But, (what is a thousand times more important,) you yourself
feel safe and strong. You begin to read some treatise on Divinity; and you find yourself in
some degree competent to test the writer's statements, to endorse or to suspect his conclusions,
because you are familiar with the Rule of Faith which he himself employed. It becomes your
turn at last to instruct others,--from the pulpit for example; and instead of timid truisms,
and vague generalities, you are able to draw a bold clear outline round almost any department
of Christian doctrine. You can explain with authority.--You are not afraid to catechize before
the congregation: for although your Theological attainments are but slender after all, yet,
you know your Bible well; and even if an absurdly wrong answer is given you, you know how to
single out from the hank the golden thread of Truth, and to display it before the eyes of men
and Angels. And let me tell you, by way of ending the subject, we should hear less about dull
sermons, and inattentive congregations, and badly filled churches,--as well as about the astounding
ignorance of many among the upper classes, in Divine things,--if our younger Clergy knew the
Bible a great deal better than they do.--Aye, and we should not have so many unsound remarks
about Holy Scripture either,--so many mistaken views of doctrine,--so many crude remarks about
Inspiration,--made by persons who ought to know better.

You will perceive that I am saying all this, (except the last few words,) at you, (the younger
men present;) because in you I see many of the future Clergy of England. And I say it, because,
(for the last time,) I do entreat you, one and all, to follow the advice I have been giving
you; and to set about such a careful study of the Bible, at once. Do not put it off for a single
day. Begin it tomorrow morning. You will then have mastered Genesis this term, finishing the
last chapter on Sunday the 10th of December; and on Monday, the 11th, you will have to read
the first chapter of Exodus. I am confident that you will remember this day and hour with gratitude
to the end of your lives, if you will but make the experiment and persevere.

And just one word to those who aspire, (and all should aspire,) to University honours. You
will not find what I have been recommending any hindrance to you at all. But even supposing
you do, now and then, find the inexorable daily half-hour stand in the way of something else,--shall
not the very thought of Him whose Voice you have deliberately resolved to hear daily at that
fixed time, make you full amends? Shall you resolve to pluck so freely of the Tree of Knowledge,
and yet begrudge the approach once a day to the Tree of Life, which grows in the midst of the
Paradise of GOD? Shall ample time be found for works of fiction,--for the Review, and the Magazine,
and the newspaper,--yet half an hour a day be deemed too much to be given to the Word of GOD?
What? room for everything and everybody; yet still "no room in the Inn" for CHRIST!... I have,
(I speak honestly,) I have far too high an opinion of your instincts for good, to think it
possible. You have plenty of faults,--(God knoweth!),--but I am very much deceived indeed if
there be not a spirit stirring among the young men of this place, overflowing with promise;
a real inclination, (obscured at times, but still very energetic,) for whatever things are
pure, and lovely, and of good report.

Of course, it is implied by what goes before, that you will read no work of Divinity just at
present. Be counselled, on no account, to read any. Above all, shun the partial, ill-digested
pamphlet,--and the one-sided review,--and the controversial letter,--and the Essay which seems
to have been written in order to prove nothing. Be content, for the next three years, to study
no book of Divinity but the Bible.

And the study of that Book, I repeat, you will find no hindrance, no impediment, no burthen
to you at all. On the contrary. It will render you a very singular service,--let your classical
and logical studies be as severe as they will; (and they cannot well be too severe, too engrossing,--for
this is your golden opportunity which never will, never can, come back again!) The undersong
of "Siloa's brook that flows, fast by the oracle of GOD," will many a time soothe and refresh
your else dry and weary spirit. What was begun as a task will soon come to be regarded as a
privilege. That jealously-guarded half-hour will be found to be the one green spot in the whole
day,--like Gideon's fleece, fresh with the dew of the early morning, when it is "dry upon all
the earth beside." Your secret study of that Book of Books, I say, will render you a very singular
service. The contrast between the Divine and Human method will strike you with ever-recurring
power. Unlike every other History, the Bible removes the veil, and discovers the causes of
things,--including the First Great Cause of all, who dwelleth in Light unapproachable, but
who yet humbleth Himself to behold, and to controul, and to overrule for good, the things which
are done in Heaven and on Earth. And thus, it is not too much to say that the Bible, to one
who reads its pages aright, is a certain clue to every other History,--as well as a perpetual
commentary on every other Book. It informs the judgment, and cleanses the eye, throughout the
whole department of Morals: and as for History, what is it all, but the evidence of GOD in
the world,--"traces of His iron rod, or of His Shepherd's staff[267]?"

Profoundly sensible am I, that these have been very unintellectual, and somewhat common-place
remarks: but I would rather, a hundred times, be of use to the younger men present; I would
rather, a hundred times, succeed in persuading one of them, to adopt that method of reading
the Bible which I have been recommending;--than try to say something which might be thought
fine and clever.... Let me only, in conclusion, faithfully remind them, that the true office
of the study of Divine things is not, by any means, that which, for obvious reasons, I have
been rather dwelling and enlarging upon. It is not merely to inform the understanding, that
Holy Scripture is to be read with such consummate attention, and studied with such exceeding
care. It is not for the illustration of History, or in order that it may be made a test of
the value of other systems of Morals. Not, by any means, in order to facilitate admission into
Holy Orders, (for which only some of you are destined;)--or to render a man's pulpit-addresses
attractive and agreeable;--or even to enable a parish priest to teach with confidence and authority;--is
he entreated now to "prevent the night watches," if need be, that he may be occupied (like
one of old time[268],) with GOD'S Word. O no! It is,--in order that his inner life may be made
conformable to that outer Law[269]: that his aims may be ennobled, and his motives purified,
and his earthly hopes made consistent with the winning of an imperishable crown! It is in order
that when he wavers between Right and Wrong, the unutterable Canon of GOD'S Law may suggest
itself to him as a constraining motive. Its aim, and purpose, and real function, is, that the
fiery hour of temptation may find the Christian soldier armed with "the sword of the Spirit,
which is the Word of GOD[270]:"--that the dark season of Adversity may find his soul anchored
on the Rock of Ages,--which alone can prove his soul's sufficient strength and stay.... Of
a truth, as Life goes on, Men will find the blessedness of their Hope; if they have not found
it out already. Under every form of trial,--and under every strange vicissitude;--in sickness,--and
in perplexity,--and in bereavement,--and in the hour of death;--"LORD,--to whom shall we go?
Thou,--Thou hast the words of Eternal Life!"

NATURAL SCIENCE AND THEOLOGICAL SCIENCE.

St. Paul, in a famous and familiar chapter of his Epistle to the Hebrews, having declared "what
Faith is," proceeds, (as the heading of the chapter expresses it), to note "the worthy fruits
thereof in the Fathers of old time." The Book of Genesis was obviously in his hands, or in
his heart, while he wrote: for he appeals to the transactions there recorded, in the very order,
and often in the very words, of Moses. The HOLY GHOST, I say, directs our attention to what
is contained in the ivth,--vth,--vith,--xiith,--xviith,--xxiind,--xxviith,--xlviiith,--and
lth chapters of Genesis. But He begins with a yet earlier chapter. He begins with the first.
Abel,--Enoch,--Noah,--Abraham,--Sarah,--Isaac, --Jacob,--Joseph;--these stand forward as samples
of God's faithful ones. But with them, the HOLY GHOST proposes to associate us. Moreover, He
gives us the place of honour. Before mentioning one of their acts of Faith, He mentions one
of ours. We come first,--then they. And the particular field in which we shine out so conspicuously,--the
special province which is assigned to us,--that portion of the inspired Narrative wherein you
and I are supposed to shew a degree of undoubting faith which entitles us to rank with those
"Fathers of old time,"--is found to be the first chapter of the Book of Genesis. "Through Faith
we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God." An honourable place, and an
honourable function truly! I would to GOD that it might be as gratifying to every one of the
congregation, as it is to the preacher, to discover that this is the special stand-point which
has been reserved for him and for them.

Since, however, it is impossible to forget that we have sometimes seen heads, which are supposed
to be very much indeed in advance of the age, shaken ominously at the very chapter which the
text bequeaths and commends to the special acceptance of you and me,--I propose that, in the
very briefest manner, we now review the contents of that chapter; in order that we may discover
what is the special absurdity, or impossibility, or improbability, or by whatever other name
the thing is to be called,--which makes it quite out of the question that you or I should undertake
the act of Faith here assigned us.

I read then, that "In the beginning, GOD created the Heaven and the Earth:"--by which I understand,
that, at some remote period,--which may or may not baffle human Arithmetic[272],--it was the
pleasure of GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON, GOD the HOLY GHOST,--three Persons, coeternal and
coequal,--one GOD,--out of nothing, to create the entire Universe. The word in the original
does not indeed necessarily imply as much: but since there is no word in Hebrew, (any more
than there is in Greek, Latin, or English,) peculiarly expressive of the notion of creating
out of nothing, it need not excite our surprise that Moses does not employ such a word to describe
what God did "in the beginning."--Then it was, in the grey of that far distant morning I mean,
that all those glittering orbs which sow the vault of Heaven with brightness and with beauty,
flashed into sudden being. Suns, the centres of systems, many of them so distant from this
globe of ours, that sun and system scarce shew so bright as a single lesser star: suns, I say,
with their marvellous equipage of attendant bodies,--our sun among the rest, with all those
wandering fires which speed their unwearied courses round it: suns, and planets with their
moons, bathed once and for ever in the fountain of that Light which GOD inhabited from all
Eternity, then marshalled themselves in mysterious order, according to "the counsel of His
will[275]:" yea, and with their furniture, unimagined and unimaginable, went careering through
the untrodden realms of space, each on its several errand of glory, because of obedience to
its Maker's sovereign Law[276]. "By the Word of the LORD," (as it is written,) "were the Heavens
made; and all the hosts of them by the breath of His mouth[277]!"

Now, it is reserved to the geologist,--(Nature's High-priest!)--to guess at the condition of
this Earth of ours throughout all the long period of unchronicled ages which immediately succeeded
the birthday of Time. It is for him to guess at the successive changes which this globe of
ours underwent; and the progressive cycles of Creation of which it was the theatre; and the
many strange races of creatures which, one after another, moved upon its surface,--walking
the dry, or inhabiting the moist. He shall guess; and I will sit at his feet and listen, with
unfeigned gratitude, wonder, and delight, while he reports to me his guesses: (for the really
great man is eager to assure me that they are no more.)--But when his tale of perplexity is
ended, and the last 6,000 years of this world's History have to be discussed, the geologist's
function is at an end. I bid him, in GOD'S Name, be silent; for now it is GOD that speaketh.
If any question be moved as to how that actual system of things to which Man belongs, began,--I
bid him come down, and take the learner's place; for now I mean to assume his vacant chair.
This time, there shall at least be no guess-work. GOD is now the Speaker: and what GOD revealeth
unto me, that I promise faithfully to report to him.

There was a time, then,--and it was certainly less than 6,000 years ago,--when "the Earth was
without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep." What catastrophe it was
which had caused that the fountains of the abyss should be broken up, and the solid Earth submerged,
I am not concerned to explain:--nor how it had come to pass that from a world of seas and continents,
it had become a watery ball, wrapped about with superincumbent vapour:--nor how the blessed
sunlight had suffered dire eclipse;--so that the Earth revolved in a horror of great darkness.
My faith however is not troubled,--nor even perplexed,--by the strangeness of these things.
Shall I think it a mere matter of course that one little flaw in a pipe shall, in a second
of time, transform the orderly well-compacted seats of a goodly Church to one unsightly mass
of shapeless and disordered ruin[278]; and shall I pretend to stand aghast at the strangeness
of a similar overthrow of this Earth's furniture at the mere fiat of the Most High?... Behold,
"He measureth the waters in the hollow of His Hand, and weigheth the mountains in scales[279]."
What if the Creator of the earth and the sea shall bid them of a sudden change places? Think
you that they would hesitate to obey Him?

1. But it was now GOD'S pleasure to bring Beauty out of Chaos, and to establish a fresh order
of things upon the surface of our Earth. And, as the first step thereto, "the SPIRIT of GOD
moved upon the face of the waters." The Hebrew phrase implies no less than the tremulous brooding
as of a bird,--causing the dreary waste to heave and swell with coming life. "And GOD said,
Let there be Light. And there was Light." "He spake and it was done[285]." From Himself, who
is "the true Light," (not from the Sun, which,--like the rest of the orbs of Heaven,--is but
a lamp of His kindling);--from Himself, I say, a ray of Light went forth; and that is why He
was pleased to praise it. Look through the chapter, and you will find that it is the only one
of His creatures of which it is specially said that "GOD saw that it was good[286]." ... Thus,
one hemisphere was illumined,--whereby "GOD divided the light from the darkness;" and when
the Earth had completed a single revolution, there had been a Day and there had been a Night,--so
named by the Word of GOD: "and the evening and the morning were the first Day[287]." ... Do
you see any impossibility so far? I, certainly, see none. It does not seem to me absurd that
"the Light of the world[288]," "dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto[289],"
should cause "the light to shine out of darkness[290]." We shall perhaps come upon the absurdity
by and by. Let us hasten forward.

2. "And GOD said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the
waters from the waters." The Hebrew word (an expansion), and the context, shew plainly enough
what is meant. The atmosphere was now created,--whereupon the watery particles either subsided
into sea, or rose aloft in the form of clouds. "And the evening and the morning were the second
Day,"--which is the only day of which it is not said that GOD saw that it was good.

3. "And GOD said, Let the waters under the Heaven be gathered together unto one place, and
let the dry land appear." Then it was that these continents were upheaved,--other than those
which had been continents before; and the sea sank into the cavities which had been ordained
for its reception. Then, "GOD saw that it was good." The sentence of approval which had been
withheld from the work of yesterday, because that work, (namely, of dividing the waters from
the waters,) was incomplete,--is freely bestowed to-day. And it may have been to teach us that
no incomplete work is "good," in GOD'S sight.--Next, the Creator called into being every extant
form of vegetable life. So that, instead of a world of waters, which was all that was to be
seen yesterday,--not only cliffs, and mountains, and bays,--but green hills, and fertile valleys,
and grassy meadows had come to view,--with lakes, and rivers, and fountains, and falls of water.
And so it was. Sun, moon, and stars, came to view[291]; and this globe of ours, no longer illumined,
as, for three days, it had been, rejoiced in the sun's genial light by day,--and by night in
the splendours of the paler planet. And thus was also gained an easy measure for marking time,--the
succession of months and years, as well as of days. Thus the inhabitants of the sea and of
the air were called into existence; and it was from the sea that GOD seems to have commanded
that they should derive their being. He saw that it was good, and He blessed the fish and the
winged fowl; "and the evening and the morning were the fifth Day."

6. It remained only to provide for the dry land its occupants; and the Earth was accordingly
commanded to bring forth the living creature after his kind,--beast and cattle and creeping
thing. Unlike that first Creation which was of all things out of nothing, the work of the six
days was a creation of new things out of old.--To the Creation of Man, His crowning work, GOD
is declared to have come with deliberation; as well as to have announced His purpose with significant
solemnity of allusion.

I have preferred thus to complete the history of Man's Creation; which presents us with the
primal institution of all,--that, namely, of Marriage.--"On the seventh Day, GOD rested from
all His work which He had made; and blessed the seventh Day, and sanctified it; because that
in it He had rested from all His work."--This then is the other great primæval institution;
more ancient than the Fall,--the Law of the Sabbath;--which in the sacred record is brought
into such august prominence. And never do we ponder over that record, without apprehension
at what may be the possible results of relaxing the stringency of enactments which would seem
to be, to our nature, as the very twin pillars of the Temple,--its establishment and its strength[293].

Now, on a review of all this wondrous History, I profess myself at a loss to see what special
note of impracticability it presents that I should hesitate to embrace it, in the plain natural
sense of the words, with both the arms of my heart. That it is not such an account of the manner
of the Creation as you or I should have ourselves invented, or anticipated, or on questionable
testimony have felt disposed to accept,--is very little to the purpose. Apart from Revelation,
we could really have known nothing at all about the works of the Days of the first Great Week.
Ejaculations therefore concerning the strangeness of the record, and cavils at the phraseology
in which it is propounded, are simply irrelevant.

There exists however a vague suspicion after all that the beginning of Genesis is a vision,
or an allegory, or a parable,--or anything you please, except true History. It is hard to imagine
why. If there be a book in the whole Bible which purports to be a plain historical narrative
of actual events, that book is the book of Genesis. In nine-tenths of its details, it is as
human, and as matter of fact, as any book of Biography or History that ever was penned. Why
the first page of it is to be torn out, treated as a myth or an allegory, and in short explained
away,--I am utterly at a loss to discover. There is no difference in the style. Long since
has the theory that Genesis is composed of distinguishable fragments, been exploded[294]. There
is no pretence for calling this first chapter poetry, and treating it by a distinct set of
canons. It is a pure Revelation, I admit: but I have yet to learn why the revelation of things
intelligible, where the method of speech is not such as to challenge a figurative interpretation,
is not to be taken literally: unless indeed it has been discovered that a narrative must of
necessity be fabulous if the transactions referred to are unusually remote and extraordinary.
The events recorded are unique in their character,--true. But this happens from the very necessity
of the case. The creation of a world, to the inhabitants of that world is an unique event.

But we are assured that some of the statements in this first chapter of Genesis are palpably
untrue;--as when it is said that the Sun, Moon, and Stars were created on the fourth Day,--which,
it is urged, is a physical impossibility: for what forces else sustained, and kept this world
a sphere? The very ascription of speech to GOD, gives offence.--Again, some raw conceit of
the advanced state of the human intellect rejects with scorn the notion of Adam oracularly
bestowing names on GOD'S creatures. Finally, the creation of Eve, moulded by GOD from the side
of the Protoplast, is declared to savour so plainly of the mythical, allegorical, or figurative;
that the narrative must be allowed to be altogether unworthy of such wits as ours.

But we have seen that the creation of Sun, Moon, and Stars is not assigned to the fourth day--but
to "the beginning"--The antiquity of this Earth we affirm to be a circumstance left wholly
untouched by the Mosaic record: or, if touched, it is rather confirmed; for, before beginning
to describe the work of the first Day, Moses describes the state of "the Earth" by two Hebrew
words of most rare occurrence[295], which denote that it had become waste and empty: while
"the deep" is spoken of as being already in existence.--There is nothing at all unphilosophical
in speaking of Light as existing apart from the Sun. Rather would it be unphilosophical to
speak of the Sun as the source and centre of Light.--I see nothing more childish again in the
mention of "the greater and the lesser light," than in the talk of "sun-rise" and "sun-set,"--which
is to this hour the language of the Observatory.--As for attributing speech to GOD, I am content
to remind you of Hooker's explanation of the design of Moses therein, throughout the present
Chapter. "Was this only his intent," (he asks,) "to signify the infinite greatness of GOD'S
power by the easiness of His accomplishing such effects without travail, pain, or labour? Surely
it seemeth that Moses had herein besides this a further purpose; namely, first to teach that
GOD did not work as a necessary, but a voluntary agent, intending beforehand and decreeing
with Himself that which did outwardly proceed from Him; secondly, to shew that GOD did then
institute a Law natural to be observed by Creatures, and therefore according to the manner
of laws, the institution thereof is described, as being established by solemn injunction. His
commanding those things to be which are, and to be in such sort as they are, to keep that tenure
and course which they do, importeth the establishment of Nature's Law.... And as it cometh
to pass in a kingdom rightly ordered, that after a Law is once published, it presently takes
effect far and wide, all states framing themselves thereunto; even so let us think that it
fareth in the natural course of the world. Since the time that GOD did first proclaim the edicts
of His Law upon it, Heaven and Earth have hearkened unto His voice, and their labour hath been
to do His will[296]."--"He spake the word, and they were made: He commanded and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever. He hath given them a law which shall not be broken[297]."

Whether or no South overestimated Adam's knowledge, I will not pretend to decide: but I am
convinced the truth lies more with him than with certain modern wits, when he says concerning
our first Father:--"He came into the world a philosopher; which sufficiently appeared by his
writing the nature of things upon their names.... His understanding could almost pierce into
future contingents; his conjectures improving even to prophecy, or the certainties of prediction.
Till his Fall, he was ignorant of nothing but sin.... There was then no struggling with memory,
no straining for invention. His faculties were ready upon the first summons.... We may collect
the excellency of the understanding then, by the glorious remainders of it now: and guess at
the stateliness of the building by the magnificence of its ruins.... And certainly that must
needs have been very glorious, the decays of which are so admirable. He that is comely when
old and decrepit, surely was very beautiful when he was young! An Aristotle was but the rubbish
of an Adam; and Athens but the rudiments of Paradise[298]."

And lastly, as for so much of the Divine narrative as concerns the Creation of the first human
pair, I am content to remind you of a circumstance which in addressing believers ought to be
of overwhelming weight: namely, that our SAVIOUR and His Apostles, again and again, refer to
the narrative before us in a manner which precludes the notion of its being anything but severest
History. Our SAVIOUR CHRIST even resyllables the words spoken by the Protoplast in Paradise;
and therein finds a sanction for the indissoluble nature of the marriage bond[299].

I take leave to add that even the respectful attempt to make Genesis accommodate itself to
the supposed requirements of Geology, by boldly assuming that the days of Creation were each
a thousand years long,--seems inadmissible. Even were such an hypothesis allowed, nothing would
be gained: for Geology does not by any means require us to believe that after a thousand years
of misty light, there came a thousand years of ocean deposit: and again, a thousand years of
moist and dry, during which vegetable life alone prevailed: and then a thousand years of sun,
moon, and stars. The very notion seems absurd[300].--But, what is more to the purpose, such
an interpretation seems to stultify the whole narrative. A week is described. Days are spoken
of,--each made up of an evening and a morning. GOD'S cessation from the work of Creation on
the Seventh Day is emphatically adduced as the reason of the Fourth Commandment,--the mysterious
precedent for our observance of one day of rest at the end of every six days of toil,--"for
in six days" (it is declared,) "the LORD made Heaven and Earth[301]." You may not play tricks
with language plain as this, and elongate a week until it shall more than embrace the span
of all recorded Time.

Neither am I able to see what would be gained by proposing to prolong the Days of Creation
indefinitely, so as to consider them as representing vast and unequal periods; (though I am
far from presuming to speak of any pious conjecture with disrespect.) My inveterate objection
to this scheme is again twofold. (1) The best-ascertained requirements of Geology are not satisfied
by a sixfold division of phenomena corresponding with what is recorded in Genesis of the Six
Days of Creation. (2) This method does even greater violence to the letter of the inspired
narrative than the scheme of reconcilement last hinted at.

I dare not believe that what has been spoken will altogether meet the requirements of minds
of a certain stamp. A gentleman, who certainly has the advantage of appearing in good company,
has lately favoured the world with the information that the first chapter of Genesis is the
uninspired speculation of a Hebrew astronomer, who was bent on giving "the best and most probable
account that could be then given of GOD'S universe[302]." The Hebrew writer asserts indeed
"solemnly and unhesitatingly that for which he must have known that he had no authority[303];"
but we need not therefore "attribute to him wilful misrepresentation, or consciousness of asserting
that which he knew not to be true[304]." If this "early speculator" The history of this important
discovery and of others of a similar nature, (which, by the way, are one and all announced
with the same "modesty of assertion" as what goes before,) would appear to be this.--Natural
science has lately woke up from her long slumber of well nigh sixty ages; and with that immodesty
for which youth and inexperience have ever been proverbial, she is impatient to measure her
crude theories against the sure revelation of GOD'S Word. Where the two differ, she assumes
that of course the inspired Oracles are wrong, and her own wild guesses right. She is even
indecent in her eagerness to invalidate the testimony of that Book which has been the confidence
and stay of GOD'S Servants in all ages. On any evidence, or on none, she is prepared to hurl
to the winds the august record of Creation. Inconveniently enough for the enemies of GOD'S
Word, every advance in Geological Science does but serve to corroborate the record that the
Creation of Man is not to be referred to a remoter period than some six thousand years ago.
But of this important fact we hear but little. On the other hand, no trumpet is thought loud
enough to bruit about a suspicion that Man may be a creature of yet remoter date. Thus, fragments
of burnt brick found fifty feet below the surface of the banks of the Nile, were hailed as
establishing Man's existence in Egypt more than 13,000 years; until it was unhappily remembered
that burnt brick in Egypt belongs to the period of the Roman dominion.--More recently, implements
of chipped flint found, with some bones, in a bed of gravel, have been eagerly appealed to
as a sufficient indication that the Creation of Man is to be referred to a period at least
10,000 years more remote than is fixed by the Chronology of the Bible.... Brick and flint!
a precious fulcrum, truly, for a theory which is to upset the World!

But I shall be told,--with that patronizing air of conscious intellectual superiority which
a certain class of gentlemen habitually assume on such occasions,--that I mistake the case
completely: that no wish is entertained in any quarter to invalidate the truth of Revelation,
or to shake Men's confidence in the Bible as the Word of GOD: that it has been the way of narrow-minded
bigots in all ages, and is so in this, to raise an outcry of the Bible being in danger, and
so to rouse the prejudices of mankind: that the error lies in claiming for the Bible an office
which it nowhere claims for itself, and which it was never meant to fulfil: that the harmony
between the Bible and Nature is complete, but that it is not such a harmony as is sometimes
imagined: that the Bible is not a scientific book, and was never meant to teach Natural Science:
that it was designed to inculcate moral goodness, and is clearly full of unscientific statements,
which it is the office of Science to correct; and, if need be, to remove. All this, and much
beside, I shall be told. Such fallacious platitudes have been put forth by men who are neither
Divines nor Philosophers, ad nauseam, within the last forty or fifty years.

Now, in reply, we have a few words to say. The profession of faithfulness we hail with pleasure:
the imputation of imbecility we accept with unconcern. But when gentlemen tell us that the
Bible was never meant to teach Science; and that wherever its statements are opposed to the
clear inductions of reason, they must give way; and so forth: we take the liberty of retaliating
their charge. We inform them that they really mistake the case entirely. When they go on to
tell us that they believe in the truth of the Bible as sincerely as ourselves: that its harmonies
are complete, but not such as we imagine; and so forth;--we venture to add that they really
know not what they assert. In plain language, they talk nonsense. Of a simple unbeliever we
know at least what to think. But what is to be thought of persons who disbelieve just whatever
they dislike, and yet profess to be just as hearty believers as you or I?

That the Mosaic record of Creation has been thought at variance with certain deductions of
modern observation, is not surprising: seeing that the deductions of each fresh period have
been at variance with the deductions of that which went before; and seeing that the theory
of one existing school is inconsistent with the theory of another.--That the Bible is not,
in any sense, a scientific treatise again, is simply a truism: (who ever supposed that it was?).
Moses writes "the history of the Human Race as regards Sin and Salvation: not a cosmical survey
of all the successive phenomena of the globe[306]." Further, that he employs popular phraseology
when speaking of natural phenomena, is a statement altogether undeniable. But such remarks
are a gross fallacy, and a mere deceit, if it be meant that the statements in the Bible partake
of the imperfection of knowledge incident to a rude and primitive state of society. To revive
an old illustration,--Is a philosopher therefore a child, because, in addressing children,
he uses language adapted to their age and capacity? GOD speaks in the First Chapter of Genesis,--hath
spoken for three and thirty hundred years,--as unto children: but there is no risk therefore
that in what He saith, He either hath deceived, or will deceive mankind.

You are never to forget the great fundamental position, that the Bible claims to be the Word
of GOD; and that GOD'S Word can never contradict or be contradicted by GOD'S works. We therefore
reject, in limine, all insinuations about the "unscientific" character of the Bible. A scientific
man does not cease to be scientific because he does not choose always to express himself scientifically.
Again. A man of universal Science does not forfeit his scientific reputation, if, in the course
of a moral or religious argument, his allusions to natural phenomena are expressed in the ordinary
language of mankind. Even so, Almighty God, "in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge[307],"--speaking to us by the mouth of His holy Prophets, never, that I am aware,
teaches them to speak a strictly scientific language,--except when the Science of Theology
is being discoursed of. On other occasions, He suffers their language to be like yours or mine.
"Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon[308]:"--"The clouds drop down the dew[309]:"--"The wind
bloweth where it listeth[310]."--Not so when Theology is the subject. Then the language becomes
scientific.

But there is this great difference between the cases supposed. A man of universal scientific
attainment will be less strong in one subject than another: and in the course of his Geological
allusions, if Mechanical Science be his forte,--in the course of his Metaphysical allusions,
if Mathematical Science be his proper department,--he may easily err. Above all, the limits
of the knowledge of unassisted Man must infallibly be those of the age in which he lives. But,
with the Ancient of Days, it is not so. He at least cannot err. Nothing that man has ever discovered
by laborious induction was not known to Him from the beginning: nothing that He hath ever commissioned
His servants to deliver, will be found inconsistent with the anterior facts of History. "He
that made the eye, shall He not see[315]?" The records of Creation then cannot be incorrect.
The course of Man's history must be that which, speaking by the mouth of His Prophets, GOD
hath described.

"I never said the contrary," is the reply. "All I say is that you interpret the records of
Creation wrongly: and that you are disposed to lay greater stress on the historical accuracy
of the Bible than the narrative will bear."

O but, sir, whoever you may be who censure me thus, let me in all kindness warn you of the
pit, at the very edge whereof you stand!

Far be it from such an one as the preacher to assume that he so apprehends the First Chapter
of Genesis, that if an Angel were to turn interpreter, he might not convince me of more than
one misapprehension in matters of detail. Further, I boldly assert that he who could prove
the contradictory, would make the Bible, even as a Theological Book, nothing worth, to you and me.

The same must be said of the Bible chronology. And here I will adopt the words of one who is
justly entitled to be listened to in this place; and who must at least be allowed to be a competent
judge of the matter, for he made Chronology his province. Mr. Clinton says:--"Those who imagine
themselves at liberty to enlarge the time [which elapsed from the Creation to the Deluge, and
from the Deluge to the Birth of Abraham,] to an indefinite amount,--mistake the nature of the
question. The uncertainty here is not an uncertainty arising from want of testimony: (like
that which occurs in the early chronology of Greece, and of many other countries; when the
times are uncertain because no evidence is preserved.) ... The uncertainty here is of a peculiar
character, belonging to this particular case. The evidence exists, but in a double form; and
we have to decide which is the authentic and genuine copy. But if the one is rejected, the
other is established:" the difference between the two being exactly 1,250 years.--Men are free
to reject the evidence, to be sure; but we defy them to explain it away. The chronological
details of the Bible are as emphatically set down as anything can be; and,--(with the exception
of a few particulars, chiefly in the Book of Kings, which are to the record what misprints
are to a printed book,)--they are entirely consistent; and hang perfectly well together. Let
us not be told, then, that we entertain groundless apprehensions for the authority of GOD'S
Word when we hear it proposed to refer the Creation of Man to a period of unheard-of antiquity.
Destroy my confidence in the Bible as an historical record, and you destroy my confidence in
it altogether; for by far the largest part of the Bible is an historical record. If the Creation
of Man,--the longevity of the Patriarchs,--the account of the Deluge;--if these be not true
histories, what is to be said of the lives of Abraham, of Jacob, of Joseph, of Moses, of Joshua,
of David,--of our Saviour Christ Himself?

But there is a scornful spirit abroad which is not content to allegorize the earlier pages
of the Bible,--to scoff at the story of the Flood, to reject the outlines of Scripture Chronology;--but
which would dispute the most emphatic details of Revelation itself. Consistent, this method
is, at all events. Let it have the miserable praise which is so richly its due. To logical
consistency, it may at least lay claim. It refuses to stop anywhere: as why should it stop?
Faith is denied her office, because Reason fails to see the reasonableness of Faith: and accordingly,
unbelief enters in with a flood-tide. Miracles, for example, are now to be classed, (we learn,)
among "the difficulties" of Christianity[316]. It was to have been expected. (Who foresees
not what must be the fate of such "difficulties" as these?) And will you tell me that you may
reject the miraculous transactions recorded in the Old and New Testaments, and yet retain the
narrative which contains them? That were indeed absurd! Will you then reject one miracle and
retain another? Impossible! You can make no reservation, even in favour of the Incarnation
of our LORD,--the most adorable of all miracles, as it is the very keystone of our Christian
hope. Either, with the best and wisest of all ages, you must believe the whole of Holy Scripture;
or, with the narrow-minded infidel, you must disbelieve the whole. There is no middle course
open to you.

Do we then undervalue the discoveries of Natural Science; or view with jealousy the progress
she has of late been making? GOD forbid! With unfeigned joy we welcome her honest triumphs,
as so many fresh evidences of the wisdom, the power, the goodness of GOD. "Thou, LORD, hast
made me glad through Thy works[317]!" The very guesses of Geology are precious. What are they
but noble endeavours to unfold a page anterior to the first page of the Bible; or rather, to
discover what secrets are locked up in the first verse of it? But when, instead of being a
faithful Servant, Natural Science affects the airs of an imperious Mistress,--what can she
hope to incur at the hands of Theology, but displeasure and contempt? She forgets her proper
place, and overlooks her lawful function. She prates about the laws of Nature in the presence
of Him who, when He created the Universe, invented those very laws, and impressed them on His
irrational creatures.--Does it never humble her to reflect that it was but yesterday she detected
the fundamental Law of Gravitation? Does she never blush with shame to consider that for well
nigh six thousand years men have been inquisitively walking this Earth's surface; and yet,
that, one hundred years ago, the provident notions concerning fossil remains, and the Earth's
structure, were such as now-a-days would be pronounced incredibly ridiculous and absurd?

To conclude. The very phraseology with which men have presumed to approach this entire question,
is insolent and unphilosophical. The popular phraseology of the day, I say, hardly covers,
so as to conceal, a lie. We constantly find SCIENCE and THEOLOGY opposed to one another: just
as if Theology were not a Science! History forsooth, with all her inaccuracy of observation,
is a Science: and Geology, with all her weak guesses, is a Science: and comparative Anatomy,
with nothing but her laborious inductions to boast of, is a Science: but Theology,--which is
based on the express revelation of the Eternal,--is some other thing! What do you mean to tell
us that Theology is, but the very queen of Sciences? Would Aristotle have bestowed on Ethic
the epithet ἀρχιτεκτονική, think you, had he known of that θεῖος λόγος, which his friend,--"not
blind by choice, but destined not to see[318],"--felt after yet found not? that "more excellent
way," which you and I, by GOD'S great mercy, possess? Go to! For popular purposes, if you will,
let the word "Science" stand for the knowledge of the phenomena of Nature; somewhat as, in
this place, the word stands for the theory of Morals, and some of the phenomena of Mind: and
so, let Science be contrasted with THEOLOGY, without offence taken, because none is intended.
But let it never be forgotten that Theology is the great Science of all,--the only Science
which really deserves the name. What have other sciences to boast of which Theology has not?
Antiquity,--such as no other can, in any sense, lay claim to: a Literature,--which is absolutely
without a rival: a Terminology,--which reflects the very image of all the ages: Professors,--of
loftier wit, from the days of Athanasius and Augustine, down to the days of our own Hooker
and Butler,--men of higher mark, intellectually and morally,--than adorn the annals of any
other Science since the World began: above all things, a subject-matter, which is the grandest
imagination can conceive; and a foundation, which has all the breadth, and length, and depth
and height[319], which the Hands of GOD Himself could give it.

For subject-matter, what Science will you compare with this? All the others in the world will
not bring a man to the knowledge of GOD and of CHRIST! They will not inform him of the will
of GOD, although they may teach him to observe His Works. "The Heavens declare the glory of
GOD,"--but, as Lord Bacon remarked long since, we do not read that they declare His will. Neither
do the other sciences of necessity lead to any belief at all in the GOD of Revelation[320].

And, for that whereon they are built, what Science again will you compare with this? Let the
pretender to Geological skill,--(I say not the true Geologist, for he never offends!)--let
the conceited sciolist, I say, go dream a little longer over those implements of chipped flint
which have called him into such noisy activity,--and discover, as he will discover, that the
assumed inference from the gravel and the bones is fallacious after all[321].--Let the Historian
go spell a little longer over that moth-eaten record of dynasties which never were, by means
of which he proposes to set right the clock of Time[322]. Let the Naturalist walk round the
stuffed or bleached wonders of his museum, and guess again[323]. Theological Science not so!
Her evidence is sure, for her Rule is GOD'S Word. No laborious Induction here,--fallacious
because imperfect; imperfect because human: but a direct message from the presence-chamber
of the LORD of Heaven and Earth,--decisive because inspired; infallible because Divine. The
express Revelation of the Eternal is that whereon Theological Science builds her fabric of
imperishable Truth: that fabric which, while other modes change, shift, and at last become
superseded, shines out,--yea, and to the very end of Time will shine out,--unconscious of decay,
incapable of improvement, far, far beyond the reach of fashion: a thing unchanged, because
in its very nature unchangeable[324]!

O sirs,--we are constrained to be brief in this place. The field must perforce be narrowed;
and so, for this time, it must suffice to have warned you against the men who resort to the
armoury of Natural Science for weapons wherewith to assail GOD'S Truth. Regard them as the
enemies of your peace; and learn to reject their specious, yet most inconsequential reasonings,
with the scorn which is properly their due. Contempt and scorn GOD implanted in us, precisely
that we might bestow them on reasonings worthless in their texture, and foul in their object,
as these; which teach distrust of the earlier pages of GOD'S Word, on the pretence that they
are contradicted by the evidence of GOD'S Works. Learn to abhor that spurious liberality which
is liberal only with what is not its own; and which reminds one of nothing so much as the conduct
of leprous persons who are said to be for ever seeking to communicate and extend their own
unhappy taint to others. I allude to that sham liberality which under pretence of extending
the common standing ground of Christian men, is in reality attenuating it until it proves incapable
of bearing the weight of a single soul. There is room on the Rock for all; but it is only on
the Rock that we are safe. To speak without a figure,--He who surrenders the first page of
his Bible, surrenders all. He knows not where to stop. Nay, you and I cannot in any way afford
to surrender the beginning of Genesis; simply because upon the truth of what is there recorded
depends the whole scheme of Man's salvation,--the need of that "second Man" which is "the LORD
from Heaven[325]." It is not too much to say that the beginning of Genesis is the foundation
on which all the rest of the Bible is built[326]. We may not go over to those who would mutilate
the Book of Life, or evacuate any part of its message. It is they, on the contrary, who must
come over to us.--Much has it been the fashion of these last days, (I cannot imagine why,)
to vaunt the character and the Gospel of St. John, "the disciple of Love," as he is called;
as if it were secretly thought that there is a latitudinarianism in Love which would wink at
Doctrinal obliquity; whereas St. John is the Evangelist of Dogma; and if there be anything
in the world which is jealous, that thing is Love. Indifference to Truth, and laxity of Belief,
are the growing characteristics of the age. But you will find that St. John has about four
or five times as much about TRUTH as all the other three Evangelists; while the act of Faith
receives as frequent mention in his writings alone as in all the rest of the New Testament
Canon put together[327].

Let me end, as the manner of preachers is, by gathering out of what has been spoken one brief
practical consideration.--This whole visible frame of things wherein we play our part, is hastening
to decay. Everything we behold,--ourselves included,--carries with it the prophecy of its own
speedy dissolution.--What, amid the wreck of worlds, will be our confidence?... It is an inquiry
worth making, in these the days of health, and vigour, and security, and peace. O my soul,
(learn to ask yourselves,)--O my soul, when the Heavens shall depart, and the Earth reel before
the Second Advent of its Maker;--when the Sun puts on mourning, and the very powers of Heaven
are shaken;--what shall be our confidence,--our hope,--in that tremendous day? Whither shall
we betake ourselves, amid the overthrow of universal Nature, but to the sure mercies of Him
who "in the beginning created the Heaven and the Earth?"--To those strong Hands, we intend,
(GOD helping us!) with unswerving confidence to commend our fainting spirits[328].... Him,
then, in life let us learn to reverence, on whom in death we propose so implicitly to lean!
And we only know Him in, and through, and by His WORD.

2 Tim. iii. 16.

     All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

But that is not exactly what St. Paul says. The Greek for that, would be πᾶσα Ἡ γραφή--not
πᾶσα γραφὴ--θεόπνευστός. St. Paul does not say that the whole of Scripture, collectively, is
inspired. More than that: what he says is, that every writing,--every several book of those
ἱερὰ γράμματα, or Holy Scriptures, in which Timothy had been instructed from his childhood,--is
inspired by God[331]. It comes to very nearly the same thing; but it is not quite the same
thing. St. Paul is careful to remind us that every Book in the Bible is an inspired Book[332].

But does not St. Paul himself in a certain place express a doubt--saying "I think that I have
the Spirit of GOD[336]?" and does he not contrast his own sayings with the Divine sayings,
("not I but the LORD[337]"), clearly implying that his own were not Divine? and does he not
say that he delivers certain things "by permission, and not of commandment[338]," whereby he
seems to insinuate a gradation of authority in what he delivers?--No. Not one of these things
does he do. He says, indeed, of a certain hint to married persons that he offers it "by way
of advice to them not by way of precept:" but giving advice to men is a very different thing
from receiving permission from GOD. Again, "Unto the married," (he says,) "I command, yet not
I but the LORD,"--alluding to our LORD'S words, as set down by St. Matthew, chap. xix. verse
6[339]; which is simply an historical allusion to the Gospel.--So far from "thinking" he had
the Spirit of GOD, (as if it were an open question whether he had it or not,) he says the very
contrary. Δοκέω, in all such places, implies, not doubt but certainty[340]: (as when our LORD
asks,---"Doth he thank that servant because he did the things commanded him? οὐ δοκῶ,"--I fancy
not indeed[341]!) On St. Paul's lips, as every scholar knows, the phrase is not one of doubt,
but one of indignant, or at least emphatic asseveration[342].--A man had need be very sure
he understands the record, (let me just remark in passing,) before he presumes to criticize it.

"The Spirit of CHRIST" is said by St. Peter to have been "in the prophets[343]:" and in another
place he declares that they "spake as they were moved by the HOLY GHOST[344]." The HOLY GHOST
accordingly is said to have spoken the xlist Psalm "by the mouth of David[345]." The xcvth
Psalm is declared absolutely to be the utterance of the HOLY GHOST[346]. Once, the cxth Psalm
is ascribed simply to GOD[347]; and once, to David speaking under the influence of the HOLY
GHOST[348]. The iind Psalm is described as the language of GOD the FATHER "by the mouth of
His Servant David[349]." "Well spake the HOLY GHOST by Esaias the Prophet unto our Fathers[350],"--was
the exclamation of the Apostle Paul, quoting the 9th and 10th verses of his vith chapter. When
Jeremiah speaks, the HOLY GHOST is declared, (not Jeremiah, but the HOLY GHOST) to witness
unto us[351]. The assertion is express that it was "GOD" who, "by the mouth of all His Prophets,"
foretold the Death of CHRIST[352]: "the LORD GOD of Israel" who, "by the mouth of His holy
Prophets of old," gave promise of CHRIST'S coming[353]. "The HOLY GHOST signified" what the
Mosaic Law enjoined[354]. "It is not ye that speak, but the HOLY GHOST[355]"--was our SAVIOUR'S
word of promise and of consolation to the Twelve: and, on an earlier occasion,--"It is not
ye that speak; but the SPIRIT of your Father, which speaketh in you[356]." And this promise
became so famous, that St. Paul says the Corinthians challenged him to prove that CHRIST was
speaking in him[357].... But why multiply places? The use which our SAVIOUR makes in the New
Testament of the words of the Old,--from the writings of Moses to the writings of Malachi,--would
be simply nugatory unless those words were much more than human. And the record of the Apostle
is express and emphatic:--"All Scripture--every Book of the Bible,--is given by Inspiration
of GOD."--In the face of such testimony, by the way, we deem it not a little extraordinary
to be assured (by an individual who has acquired considerable notoriety within the last few
months) that "for any of the higher or supernatural views of Inspiration there is no foundation
in the Gospels or Epistles[358]."

Strange to say, there is a marvellous indisposition in Man to admit the notion of such a heaven-sent
message. Not to dispute with those who deny Inspiration altogether, (for that would be endless,)
there are many,--and, we fear, a daily increasing number of persons,--who, admitting Inspiration
in terms, yet so mutilate the notion of it, that their admission becomes a practical lie. "St.
Paul was inspired, no doubt. So was Shakspeare." He who says this, intending no quibble, declares
that in his belief St. Paul was not inspired at all.

But this is a monstrous case, with which I will not waste your time. Far more numerous are
they, who, admitting that the Authors of the Bible were inspired in quite a different sense
from Homer and Dante, are yet for modifying and qualifying this admission after so many strange
and arbitrary fashions, that the residuum of their belief is really worth very little. One
man has a mental reservation of exclusion in favour of the two Books of Chronicles, or the
Book of Esther, or of Daniel.--Another, is content to eliminate from the Bible those passages
which seem to him to run counter to the decrees of physical Science;--the History of the Six
Days of Creation,--of the Flood,--of the destruction of Sodom,--and of Joshua's address to
Sun and Moon.--Another regards it as self-evident that nothing is trustworthy which savours
supremely of the marvellous;--as the Temptation of our first Parents,--the Manna in the Wilderness,--Balaam
reproved by the dumb ass,--and the history of Jonah.--There are others who cannot tolerate
the Miracles of the Old and the New Testament. The more timid, explain away as much of them
as they dare. What remains, troubles them. The more logical sweep them away altogether. A miracle
(they say) cannot be true because it implies a violation of the fixed and immutable laws of Nature.

And then,--(so strangely constituted are some men's minds,)--there are not a few persons who,
without exactly denying the inspiration of the Bible in any of its more marvellous portions,--(for
that would be an inconvenient proceeding,)--are yet content to regard much of it as a kind
of inspired myth. This is a class of ally (?) with whom one really knows not how to deal. The
man does not reason. He assumes his right to disbelieve, and yet will not allow that he is
an unbeliever. The world is singularly indulgent toward persons of this unphilosophical, illogical,
presumptuous class.

Now, I shall have something to say to all these different kinds of objectors, on some subsequent
occasion. But I shall be rendering the younger men a far more important service if to-day I
address my remarks to a different class of objectors altogether: that far larger body, I mean,
who without at all desiring to impugn the Inspiration of GOD'S Oracles, yet make no secret
of their belief that the Bible is full of inaccuracies and misstatements. These men ascribe
a truly liberal amount of human infirmity to the Authors of the several Books of the Bible;--slips
of memory, misconceptions, imperfect intelligence, partial illumination, and so forth;--and,
under one or other of those heads, include whatever they are themselves disposed to reject.
The writers who come in for the largest share of this indulgence, are the Evangelists; because
the Historians of our LORD'S life, having happily left us four versions of the same story,
and often three versions of the same transaction, the evidence whereby they may be convicted
of error is in the hands of all. Truly, mankind has not been slow to avail itself of the opportunity.
You will seldom hear a Gospel difficulty discussed, without a quiet assumption on the part
of the Reverend gentleman that he knows all about the matter in question, but that the Evangelist
did not. His usual method is, calmly to inform us that it is useless to look for strict consistency
in matters of minute detail; that general agreement between the four Evangelists there does
exist, and that ought to be enough. The inevitable inference from his manner of handling the
Gospels, is, that if his actual thoughts could find candid expression, we should hear him address
their blessed authors somewhat as follows:--"You are four highly respectable characters, no
doubt; and you mean well. But it cannot be expected that persons of your condition in life
should have described so many intricate transactions so minutely without making blunders. I
do not say it unkindly. I often make blunders myself,--I, who have a "clearness of understanding,"
"a power of discrimination between different kinds of Truth[359]" unknown to the Apostolic
Age!" ... Of course the preacher does not say all this. He has too keen a sense of "the dignity
of the pulpit." And so he puts it somewhat thus:--"While we are disposed to recognize substantial
agreement, and general conformity in respect of details, among the synoptical witnesses, in
their leading external outlines, we are yet constrained to withhold our unqualified acceptance
of any theory of Inspiration which should claim for these compilers exemption from the oscitancy,
and generally from the infirmities of humanity." ... This sounds fine, you know; and is thought
an ingenious way of wrapping up the charge which the Reverend preacher brings against the Evangelists;--of
having, in plain terms,--made blunders.

It will be convenient that we should narrow the ground to this single issue: for the time is
short. And in the remarks I am about to offer, I shall not imitate the example of those preachers
who dress out an easy thought in a superfluity of inflated language, only in order that its
deformity may escape detection. Be not surprised if I speak to you this morning in uncommonly
plain English; for I am determined that the simplest person present shall understand at least
what I mean. The dignity of the Blessed Evangelists, who walked with JESUS, and whom JESUS
loved,--the dignity of that Gospel which I believe to be penetrated through and through with
the Holy Spirit of GOD,--for that, I confess to a most unbounded jealousy. As for the "dignity
of the pulpit,"--I hate the very phrase! It has been made too often the shield of impiety and
the cloak of dulness.

To begin, then,--Is it, I would ask you, a reasonable anticipation that the narrative of one
inspired by GOD would prove full of inconsistencies, misstatements, slips of memory:--or indeed,
that it should contain any misstatements, any inaccuracies at all? What then is the difference
between an inspired and an uninspired writing,--the Word of GOD and the Word of Man?

The answer which I shall receive, is obvious. As a matter of fact (it is replied) there are
these inaccuracies: that is, the same transaction is described by two or more writers, and
their accounts prove inconsistent. Thus, St. Matthew begins his account of the healing of the
blind at Jericho, with the words,--"And as they were going out of Jericho:" but St. Luke, "While
He was drawing nigh to Jericho."--There are these slips of memory; as when St. Matthew ascribes
to "Jeremy the prophet" words which are found in the prophet Zechariah.--There are these misstatements,
as where the Census of the Nativity is said to have taken place under the presidentship of
Cyrenius.--And these are but samples of a mighty class of difficulties, (it is urged:)--the
two Genealogies; the Call of the four Disciples; the healing of the Centurion's servant; the
title on the Cross; the history of the Resurrection:--and again, "the sixteenth of Tiberius;"
"the days of Abiathar;" with many others.--Let me then briefly discuss the three examples first
cited,--which really came spontaneously. Each is the type of a class; and the answer to one
is, in reality, applicable to all the rest. I humbly ask for your patience and attention; promising
that I will abuse neither, though I must tax both.

The great fundamental truth to be first laid down, is this--that the Gospels are not four--but
one. The Ancients knew this very well. Εὐαγγελισταὶ μὲν τέσσαρες,--Εὐαγγέλιον δὲ ἕν--says Origen[360]:
"the Gospel-writers are four,--but the Gospel is one." Like that river which went out of Eden
to water the Garden,--it was by the HOLY GHOST "parted, and became into four heads."--The Gospels
therefore, (to call them by their common name,) are not to be regarded as four witnesses, or
rather as four culprits, brought up on a charge of fraud. Rather are they Angelic voices singing
in sweetest harmony, but after a method of Heavenly counterpoint which must be studied before
it can be understood of Men.

And next,--There is one great principle, and one only, which needs to be borne in mind for
the effectual reconciliation of every discrepancy which the four narratives present: namely,
that you should approach them in exactly the same spirit in which you approach the statement
of any man of honour of your acquaintance. Whether the Apostles of the LAMB,--men whom we believe
to have been inspired by the Holy Spirit of the Everlasting GOD,--are not entitled to far higher
respect, far higher consideration, at our hands,--I leave you to decide. As one whose joy and
crown it has been to weigh every word in the Gospel in hair-scales, I am prepared to risk the
issue. Be only as fair to the four Evangelists as you are to one another; and I am quite confident
about the result.

I appeal to the experience of every thoughtful man among you who has at all given his mind
to the subject of evidence, whether it be not the fact,--(1st) That when two or more persons
are giving true versions of the same incident, their accounts will sometimes differ so considerably,
that it will seem at first sight as if they could not possibly be reconciled: and yet (2ndly),
That a single word of explanation, the discovery of one minute circumstance,--perfectly natural
when we hear it stated, yet most unlikely and unlooked-for,--will often suffice to remove the
difficulty which before seemed unsurmountable; and further, that when this has been done, the
entire consistency of the several accounts becomes apparent; while the harmony which is established
is often of the most beautiful nature. (3rdly) That when (for whatever reason) two or more
versions of the same incident are not correct, no ingenuity can ever possibly reconcile them,
as they stand. They lean apart in hopeless divergence. In other words, they contradict one another.

Now, these principles are fully admitted in daily life. If your friend comes to you with ever
so improbable a tale, the last thing which enters into your mind is to disbelieve him. Is he
in earnest? Yes, on his honour. Is he sure he is not mistaken? That very doubt of yours requires
an apology: but your friend says,--"I am as sure as I am of my existence." "Give it me under
your hand and seal then." Your friend begins to suspect your sanity; but the matter being of
some importance, he complies. "It must be so then," you exclaim, "though I cannot understand
it.".... I only wish that men would be as fair to the Evangelists as they are to their friends!

You are requested to observe,--for really you must admit,--that any possible solution of a
difficulty, however improbable it may seem, any possible explanation of the story of a competent
witness, is enough logically and morally to exempt that man from the imputation of an incorrect
statement. The illustration which first presents itself may require an apology; but the dignity
of the pulpit shall not outweigh the dignity of His Gospel after whose blessed Name this House
is called[361]: and I can think of nothing as apposite as what follows.

It is a conceivable case, that, hereafter, three persons of known truthfulness should meet,
in a Court of Justice at the Antipodes; where the entire difficulty should turn on a question
of time. Whereas you and I know perfectly that the three clocks in question were, till lately,
kept five minutes apart: a sufficient interval, (I beg you to observe in passing,) for the
individual in question to have been seen by you walking in an easterly direction; and by me
due west; and by a third person, due east again. Highly improbable circumstances, I freely
grant, every one of them; and yet, by the hypothesis, all perfectly true! Meantime, it is conceivable
that Judge and jury would have the indecency openly to tax the three men I spoke of with inexactitude
in their statements: and it is conceivable that those three honest men--(the only true men,
it might be, in the Colony, after all,)--would carry to their grave the imputation of untruth.
Here and there, a generous heart would be found to say to them,--I share not in the vulgar
cry against you! I nothing doubt that it all fell out precisely as you assert. Either, the
clocks in Oxford went wrong that day;--or there had been some trick played with the clocks;--any
how, I believe you, for I have evidence that you are marvellously exact in all your little
statements; and you cannot have been mistaken in a plain matter like this. I have heard too
that you are not the ordinary men you seem.... The men make no answer. They care nothing for
your opinion, and my opinion. The rashness of mankind may astonish the Angels perhaps; but
the Apostles and Evangelists of CHRIST are already safe within the veil!

The difficulty supposed is not an imaginary one. St. John says that when Pilate sat in judgment
on the LORD of Glory, "it was about the sixth hour[362]." But since St. Mark says that at the
third hour they crucified Him[363],--the two statements seem inconsistent. The ancients,--(giants
at interpretation, babes in criticism,)--altered the text. Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, A.D.
300, says that he had seen it in the very autograph of St. John[364]. A learned man of our
own, however, a hundred years ago, ascertained that, in the Patriarchate of Ephesus, the hours
were not computed after the Jewish method: but, (strange to say,) exactly after our own English
method[365]. And yet, not so strange either; for the Gospel first came to us from there.--You
see at a glance that all the four mentions of time of day in St. John[366], which used to occasion
so much difficulty, become beautifully intelligible at once.

To come then to the three samples of difficulty propounded a moment ago. And first, for the
blind men of Jericho.

I. The difficulty lies all on the surface. Listen to a plain tale.

Our SAVIOUR, attended by His Disciples and followed by a vast concourse of persons, had reached
the outskirts of Jericho. A certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. He heard
the noise of a passing crowd, and inquired what it meant? He was told that Jesus of Nazareth
was passing by. He rose at once,--hastened down the main street through which, in due time,
CHRIST perforce must come; joined another blind man, (named Bartimæus,--a well-known character,
who, like himself, was accustomed to sit and beg by the road side;) and the two companions
in suffering, having stationed themselves at the exit of Jericho, waited till the Great Physician
should appear.

The crowd begins to approach; and the two blind men implore the Son of David to have pity on
them. So importunate is their suit, that the foremost of the passers-by rebuke them. The men
grow more urgent. Our SAVIOUR pauses, and orders that they shall be called. At this gracious
summons, both draw near; the more remarkable applicant flinging his outer garment from him
as he rises from his seat; but both, when they appear in our SAVIOUR'S presence, making the
same request. The Holy One, touched with compassion, laid His Hands upon their eyes, and grants
their prayer: whereupon they both follow Him in the way.

Well, (you will ask,)--what then?--"What then?" I answer. Then there is no difficulty in the
three accounts about which you spoke so unbecomingly a moment ago. Assume this plain, and not
at all improbable version of the incident, to be true, and you will find that no difficulty
remains whatever. Every recorded circumstance is accounted for, and fits in exactly with it.
I wish there were time to enlarge on some of the details, and to make some remarks on the manner
of the Evangelists in relating events: but there is no time. Besides,--without a huge copy
of the Gospel open before us all, I could not hope to make my meaning understood.

For of course you are to believe that he who would understand the Gospel must first study it.
You must ascertain, by some crucial test, confirmed by a large and careful induction, what
the character of a narrative purporting to be inspired, is. You have no right first to assume
exactly what Inspiration shall result in, and then to deny that there is Inspiration because
you fail to discover your assumed result[367]. That were foolish.

I shall perhaps be thought to lay myself open to the rejoinder,--"Neither have you any right
to assume that Inspiration will result in Infallibility." But the retort is without real point.
I do but assert that, just as every man of honour claims to be believed until he has been convicted
of a falsehood,--inspired Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles have a right to our entire confidence
in the scrupulous accuracy of every word they deliver, until it can be shewn that they have
once made a mistake.

If you will take the trouble to compare any of the cases,--in Genesis for example,--where a
conversation is first set down, and then reported by one of the speakers,--you will find that
it is deemed allowable to omit or to add clauses, even when the discourse is related in the
first person[368]. Something before inserted, is withheld: or something before withheld, is
inserted. No discourse was probably ever set down, word for word, as it was delivered. In sacred,
as in profane writings, the exact substance, or rather, the real purport, of what was spoken,
very reasonably stands for what was actually spoken. The difference is this;--that a narrative,
by man abridged, may convey a wrong impression: whereas an inspired abridgement of any history
soever cannot mislead.

Other characteristics of an inspired narrative,--the lesser Laws of the Divine Harmony, as
they may be called,--will be discovered by the attentive reader. For example, that intervening
circumstances are often passed over, without any notice taken of them whatever: while yet it
is singular how often the Evangelist shews himself conscious of what he omits by some very
minute allusion to it[369]. This must suffice however. It would require a whole sermon, a whole
volume rather, to enumerate all the features of the Evangelical method.

II. The next sample of difficulty will not occupy us long. St. Matthew is charged with a bad
memory, because he ascribes to "Jeremy the prophet[370]" words which are said to be found in
Zechariah.--Strange that men should be heard to differ about a plain matter of fact! I have
never been able to find these words in Zechariah yet!... There are words something like them,--but
not those very words, by any means,--in Zech. xi. 12. Why then is St. Matthew to be taxed with
a bad memory? Are there not other prophecies quoted in the New Testament not to be found in
the Old? Yes[371]. Is not the self-same prophecy sometimes found in two different prophets,--as
in Isaiah and Nahum? Yes[372]. Are not some prophetic passages common to Jeremiah and Zechariah?
Yes[373]. The Jews even had a saying that the Spirit of the one was in the other. Where then
remains a pretence for supposing that St. Matthew was troubled with a bad memory?

III. So, it is generally assumed that St. Luke made a mistake when he said that the census
of the Nativity was made when Cyrenius was President of Syria,--because not Cyrenius but Varus
is known to have been President about that time.--Now, there are three fair conjectures,--each
of which is sufficient to meet this difficulty: but instead of developing them, I will simply
remind you of a minute circumstance in Jewish story which shews how dangerous it is to press
a general fact against a particular statement.--In the year 4 B.C., Matthias was undeniably
the Jewish High-priest. Now, if St. Luke, describing the events of a certain day in September,
B.C. 4, had recorded that the High-priest's name was Joseph, you would have thought him guilty
of a misstatement: but the error would have been all your own,--for it has been discovered
that a person bearing that name held the office of High-priest for one single day,--namely,
the 10th of Tisri.... "A very unlikely circumstance!" you will exclaim. O yes,--a very unlikely
circumstance indeed: but, you will have the kindness to observe that that is not exactly the
point in question.

Why then are difficulties of this, or of any kind, permitted in the Gospel at all? it may be
asked.--I answer,--that they may prove instruments of probation to you and to me. The sensualist
has his trials; and the ambitious man, his. The difficulties in Holy Scripture,--which are
numerous, and diverse, and considerable,--are admirable tests of the moral, the spiritual,
the intellectual temper of Man[374]. Experience shews moreover that some of the minutest discrepancies
of all, if they be but of a character almost hopeless, are more potent to create perplexity
in minds of a certain constitution, than the gravest doubts which ever burthened the soul of
Speculation.

I have confined myself to one class of objections, for an obvious reason. Difficulties which
arise out of the matter of Scripture, as it is emphatically embodied in quotations from the
Old Testament made in the New, must be separately considered in one or more Sermons on Interpretation.
I must be content to-day with repudiating, in the most unqualified way, the notion that a mistake
of any kind whatever is consistent with the texture of a narrative inspired by the Holy Spirit
of GOD. The allusion in St. Stephen's speech to "the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum
of money of the sons of Emmor, the son" (not the father, but the son) "of Sychem," is a good
example of confusion apparently existing in an inspired speaker; but, in reality, only in the
writings of those who have sat in judgment upon his words[375].

To keep to the case of the Evangelists,--I appeal to your sense of fairness, whether it be
not reasonable to assume, that until those blessed writers have been convicted of one single
inaccuracy of statement, their narratives ought to be accounted faultless, like Him whose Life
they record;--like Him by whose Spirit they are inspired. I would to Heaven that men would
have the decency to suspect themselves, and one another, rather than the Evangelists,--of mistake;
or at least, before they venture publicly to impugn the Authors of the Everlasting Gospel,
that they would be at the pains to weigh the evidence with the care that evidence deserves,
but which I am sure that sermon-writers and essayists do not bestow. Let them spend the long
summer days of many a Long Vacation--from early morning until twilight,--dissecting every syllable
of the blessed pages; and then they will learn to adore instead of to cavil. They will deem
them absolutely faultless, instead of daring to charge all their own pitiful misconceptions,
and weak misapprehensions, and miserable blunders, upon them.--They will be inclined, rather,
to challenge the world to establish one blot in what they love so well; and would gladly stake
all upon the issue of a conflict before a fair tribunal,--if submission might follow upon defeat.

As for mistakes of the paltry kind last noticed--(the days of Abiathar, the sixteenth of Tiberius,
and so forth,)--I wonder the glaring absurdity of charging them against Evangelists, does not
strike any modest man of sane mind. To suppose that St. Matthew quoted the wrong prophet, or
that St. Luke did not know the regnal years of the reigning Emperor; that St. Stephen confused
Abraham with Jacob, and Sychem with Hebron;--all this is really so grossly absurd, that I can
hardly condescend to discuss the question. It is like maintaining that Sir Isaac Newton, after
discovering the Law of Gravitation, and calculating the pathway of a planet, persisted in saying
that two and two make five: or that Columbus, after discovering America, despaired of finding
the way to his own door. It is simply ridiculous!--Admirable as a subject for men to exercise
their wits upon,--as instruments of cavil, objections like these are about as formidable as
a child's sword of lathe in the day of battle.

I hear some one say,--It seems to trouble you very much that inspired writers should be thought
capable of making mistakes; but it does not trouble me,--Very likely not. It does not trouble
you, perhaps, to see stone after stone, buttress after buttress, foundation after foundation,
removed from the walls of Zion, until the whole structure trembles and totters, and is pronounced
insecure. Your boasted unconcern is very little to the purpose, unless we may also know how
dear to you the safety of Zion is. But if you make indignant answer,--(as would to Heaven you
may!)--that your care for GOD'S honour, your jealousy for God's oracles, is every whit as great
as our own,--then we tell you that, on your wretched premises, men more logical than yourself
will make shipwreck of their peace, and endanger their very souls. There is no stopping,--no
knowing where to stop,--in this downward course. Once admit the principle of fallibility into
the inspired Word, and the whole becomes a bruised and rotten reed. If St. Paul a little, why
not St. Paul much? If Moses in some places, why not in many? You will doubt our LORD'S infallibility
next!... It might not trouble you, to find your own familiar friend telling you a lie, every
now and then: but I trust this whole congregation will share the preacher's infirmity, while
he confesses that it would trouble him so exceedingly that after one established falsehood,
he would feel unable ever to trust that friend implicitly again.

Do you mean to say then, (I shall be asked,) that you maintain the theory of Verbal Inspiration?--I
answer, I refuse to accept any theory whatsoever[376]. But I believe that the Bible is the
Word of GOD--and I believe that GOD'S Word must be absolutely infallible. I shall therefore
believe the Bible to be absolutely infallible,--until I am convinced of the contrary. "Theories
of Inspiration," (as they are called,) are the growth of an unbelieving age: and it is enough
to disgust any one with the term, to find how it has been understood in some quarters. A well-known
living editor of the Gospel[377], says,--"According to the Verbal-Inspiration Theory, each
Evangelist has recorded the exact words of the Inscription on the Cross;--not the general sense,
but the Inscription itself;--not a letter less nor more. This is absolutely necessary to the
theory." The advocates of the theory (he proceeds) "may here find an undoubted example of the
absurdity of their view.... Let us bear this in mind when the narrative of words spoken, or
of events, differs in a similar manner."--It is certainly very kind of the learned writer thus
to apprize us of the danger of accepting a theory, which, so explained, we certainly never
heard of before,--and trust we may never hear of again.

But if, instead of the "Theory of Verbal Inspiration," I am asked whether I believe the words
of the Bible to be inspired,--I answer, To be sure I do,--every one of them: and every syllable
likewise. Do not you?--Where,--(if it be a fair question,)--Where do you, in your wisdom, stop?
The book, you allow is inspired. How about the chapters? How about the verses? Do you stop
at the verses, and not go on to the words? Or perhaps you enjoy a special tradition on this
subject, and hold that Inspiration is a general, vague kind of thing,--here more, there less:
strong, (to speak plainly,) where you make no objection to what is stated,--weak, when it runs
counter to some fancy of your own.--O Sir, but this "general vague kind of thing" will not
suffice to anchor the fainting soul upon, in the day of trouble, and in the hour of death!
"Here more, there less," will not satisfy a parched and weary spirit, athirst for the water
of Life, and craving the shadow of the great Rock. What security can you offer me, that the
promise which has sustained me so long occurs in the "more," and not in the "less?" How am
I to know that your Bible is my Bible: in other words, what proof is there that either of us
possesses the Word of GOD,--the authentic utterance of GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT,--at all?

And do you not feel, that this "will o' the wisp" phantom of your brain, can prove no guide
to either of us in the pilgrimage of life? Perceive you not that the unworthy spirit in which
you approach the Book of GOD'S Law must effectually prevent you from getting any wisdom from
it? Why, the pages which you look so coldly and carnally at, are written within and without,
and burn from end to end with unutterable meaning! While you are quarrelling about the title
on the Cross, you are missing the common salvation! You keep us, Sunday after Sunday, disputing
outside the gates of Paradise, instead of bidding us enter in, and eat of the delicious fruit!
While you are persisting that there is no beauty in the garden, (because you choose to be deaf
as well as blind,)--the shadows are lengthening out, and the glory is departing, and the angels
are getting weary of harping upon their harps!

No, Sirs! The Apocryphal books are not one atom more inspired than Bacon's Essays. But the
Bible, from the Alpha to the Omega of it, is filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit of
GOD: the Books of it, and the sentences of it, and the words of it, and the syllables of it,--aye,
and the very letters of it. "Nihil in Scripturis est otiosum," (said the great Casaubon): "non
dictio, non dictionis forma, non syllaba, non littera." ... The difficulty which attends quotations,
I must explain another day. It is not a difficulty.--The seeming paradox of calling a pedigree
inspired, is only seeming.--The text of Holy Scripture has nothing at all to do with the question.
Is a dead poet responsible for the clumsiness of him who transcribes his copy, or for the carelessness
of the apprentice in the printer's attic?--Least of all do we overlook the personality of the
human writers, when we so speak. The styles of Daniel,--of St. John,--of St. Paul,--of St.
James,--differ as much as the sounds emitted by organ pipes of wholly diverse construction.
But those human instruments were fabricated, one and all, by the Hands of the same Divine Artist:
and I have yet to learn that when the same man builds an organ, fills it with breath, and performs
upon it a piece of his own composition with matchless skill,--I have yet to learn that any
part of the honour, any part of the praise, any part of the glory of the performance is to
be withheld from him! ... The illustration is at least as old as Christianity itself. Pray
take it in the noble words of Hooker.--"They neither spoke nor wrote one word of their own:
but uttered syllable by syllable as the Spirit put it into their mouths; no otherwise than
the harp or the lute doth give a sound according to the discretion of his hands that holdeth
and striketh it with skill. The difference is only this: an instrument, whether it be pipe
or harp, maketh a distinction in the times and sounds, which distinction is well perceived
of the hearer, the instrument itself understanding not what is piped or harped. The prophets
and holy men of GOD not so. 'I opened my mouth,' saith Ezekiel, 'and GOD reached me a scroll,
saying, Son of Man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this I give thee. I ate
it, and it was sweet in my mouth as honey,' saith the prophet[378]. Yea, sweeter, I am persuaded,
than either honey or the honeycomb. For herein, they were not like harps or lutes, but they
felt, they felt the power and strength of their own words. When they spake of our peace, every
corner of their hearts was filled with joy. When they prophesied of mourning, lamentations,
and woes, to fall upon us, they wept in the bitterness and indignation of spirit, the Arm of
the LORD being mighty and strong upon them[379]."

To conclude. The first time I enjoyed this privilege, I urged the younger men to a diligent
and painful daily study of the Bible. On the next occasion, opening the Bible at the first
page, I attempted to define the provinces of Theological and of Physical Science. All that
was then offered may be summed up in one brief formula:--GOD'S works CANNOT contradict GOD'S
Word. I adverted to the method of would-be geologists, (a class all apart from the grave and
learned few who give their days and nights to a truly noble branch of study,)--because from
them the most malignant attacks have proceeded: and I took my stand on the first chapter of
Genesis, because the enemies of GOD'S Truth have made that chapter their favourite point of
attack. But my argument was not directed more against Geology than against any other of the
physical Sciences. They are all alike the handmaids of Theological Science. Geology, however,
singularly honoured by the Creator in that He hath bequeathed for her inspection so many marvels
of primæval Time,--evidences of how He was working in this remote planet before the Creation
of Man;--Geology, I say, it especially behoves to be humble: partly, because she is the youngest
of all the sciences; and partly, because the weak guesses of her childhood are yet in the memory
of us all. If indeed she would inherit the Earth, let her remember that she asks for the blessing
which CHRIST hath promised to none but the meek[380].

We altogether repudiated, then, the contrast which is often implied between Theology and Science;
as if Theology were not a Science, but some other thing. Theological Science we declared to
be the noblest of the Sciences,--the very Queen and Mistress of them all. And yet, supreme
as she is, she not only admits, but desires, and thankfully accepts the ministerial offices
of the other Sciences; all of which, like dutiful servants in a household, have it in their
power to render her most important acts of homage. Language, for example, carries the keys
of the casket wherein she keeps her treasures; and for that reason Theology hath promoted Language
to great honour. History, and Geography, and Chronology, have each had their respective tasks
assigned them. It is for Astronomy to make answer if question be raised of the date of Paschal
full Moon, or of Eclipse. Let the physiologist explain, if he can, Scriptural allusions to
the vegetable and animal kingdoms. How precious are the guesses of Geology, as she tries to
fathom the Ocean of unrecorded Time!--Who would desire the silence of the Professor of any
department of physical Science? Morals also have their place and their function assigned them;
and a thrice blessed place,--a most holy function is theirs! Why should not Moral Science have
an office even in the Court of Theology? Was not Morality the Schoolmaster of the sons of Japheth,
what time there was dew on the fleece only, but it was dry upon all the earth beside? What
are Morals else but the echoes of the voice of GOD yet lingering in the Hall of Conscience,
or rather in the Chambers of Memory?.... Her function therefore is to bear willing witness
to the Goodness, the Wisdom, the Justice of the Eternal: and her place,--the loftiest which
can be imagined for a creature,--is somewhere beneath the footstool of Almighty GOD.

But when, instead of the submissive manners of a well-ordered Court, symptoms of insolence
and insubordination are witnessed on every side,--then, the least and humblest takes leave,
(time, and place, and occasion serving,) to speak out fearlessly on behalf of that which he
loves with an unworthy, but a most undivided heart.--When Language impugns those Oracles which
she was hired to decypher,--and pretends to doubt the Inspiration of that Book of which, confessedly,
she barely understands the Grammar:--when History and Chronology cry out that the annals of
Theology are false, and her record of Time a fable; that the Deluge, for instance, is an old
wives' story, and the economy of times and seasons a human fabrication:--when Astronomical
and Mechanical Science strut up to the Throne whereon sits the Ancient of Days,--prate to Him,
(the first Author of Law,) about the "supremacy of Law,"--and tell Him to His face that His
miracles are things impossible:--when Physiology insinuates that Mankind cannot be descended
from one primæval pair; and that the lives of the Patriarchs cannot be such as they are recorded
to have been:--when the pretender to Natural Philosophy gravely assures us that we ought not
to pray for fair weather, because the weather depends not upon "arbitrary changes in the will
of GOD," but upon laws as fixed and certain "as the laws of gravitation[381],"--which, mark
you, Sirs, is no longer a dry verbal speculation, but is nothing less than an invasion of that
inner chamber where you or I have retired to pour out the fulness of an aching heart, in prayer
that GOD would prolong, if it may be, the life of the dearest thing we have on earth; and rudely
to bid us rise from our knees and be silent, for that the health of Man depends not on the
will of GOD, but on fixed physiological laws:--lastly, when the pretender to Geological skill
denies the authenticity of the First Chapter of Genesis; which is to deny the Inspiration of
all the rest; and therefore of the whole Bible;--and thus to rob Life's weary pilgrim of that
rod and staff concerning which he has many a time exclaimed,--"they comfort me!":--whenever,
as now, such things are spoken and printed,--not in a corner, and by insignificant persons,
and in ambiguous language,--but in plain English, by clergymen and scholars in authority, openly
in the face of GOD'S sun;--then it is high time, even for the humblest and least among you,--if
no man of mark will speak up, and speak out, for GOD'S Truth,--to deliver a plain message with
that freedom which Englishmen hold to be a part of their birthright. It should breed no offence,
I say, if the most unworthy of GOD'S servants, here, before you all,--before these younger
men especially, who have been drawn hither by the fame of your piety and your learning,--and
who have been entrusted to your guardianship through the precious years of early manhood, with
a well-grounded confidence that you would give them to eat not only of the Tree of Knowledge,
but also largely of the fruit of the Tree of Life:--in this Holy House too where he received
his commission[382], and vowed before GOD and Man, that he would "be ready," (the LORD being
his helper,) "with all faithful diligence to drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines
contrary to GOD's Word:"--before such an audience, and in such a place, it must and shall be
lawful for me solemnly to denounce as false and deadly,--full of nothing but pernicious consequence,--that
system of practical Infidelity which enjoys such unhappy popularity at this hour; which, under
the mask of Science, and under the specious name of Progress, is spreading like a fatal contagion
through the length and breadth of the land; and which, if suffered to go unchastised and unchecked,
will end by shaking both the Altar and the Throne!.... Look well to it, Sirs, if you care for
the safety of the Ark of GOD.

The case is not altered,--rather is it made worse,--if this hostility to GOD's Truth proceeds
from persons bearing Orders in the English Church. ("O my soul, come not thou into their secret!")
The case is not altered: for the requirements of Physical Science are still the plea; and Divines,
in no sense, these men are, however unsuccessful they may prove in establishing their claim
to the title of philosophers either. Nay, Sirs,--suffer one of yourselves to ask you, whether
these disgraceful developments are not the lawful result of your own incredible system, of
sending forth, year by year, men to be teachers and professors of Divinity,--to whom you have
yet never imparted any Theological training whatever[384].

You are requested to observe, that not only cannot GOD's Works contradict GOD's Word,--simply
because they are twin utterances of one and the same Divine Intelligence;--but also the deductions
of Physical Science cannot possibly run counter to the decrees of Theology[385],--simply because
they are respectively in a wholly diverse subject-matter. Had Theology even once delivered
a Geological decree, or pretended even once to pronounce upon any Astronomical problem; then,
indeed, there would be reason why her disciples should watch with alarm the rapid advance of
Physical Science,--instead of hailing it, as they do, with wonder and delight. Then, indeed,
we should be constrained to admit that the day might be coming when Theology would have to
reconsider the platform whereon she stands; and possibly to "give way." But it is an undeniable
fact that there exist no Theological dogmas on matters Geological,--no, not one! Theology cannot
retreat from ground on which she has never set foot. She cannot retract, what she has never
advanced, or recal the words which she has never spoken. The decrees of Theology are all confined
to the Science of Theology,--and with that subject-matter, the other Sciences have simply no
concern.

And how about Moral Science,--whom we beheld, a moment since, shrouded in her mantle, beneath
the footstool of the ALMIGHTY;--afraid to look up into His awful Face,--and not presuming to
speak, unless called upon to bear her solemn witness to what she learned of Him "in the beginning?"--Must
we imagine her too rising from her lowly seat, and presuming to sit in judgment upon the Author
of her Being? Are we to picture her arraigning the Goodness of Him who commanded Abraham to
slay his son;--or the Justice of Him who sent Saul to destroy the Amalekites;--or the Mercy
of Him who inspired certain of David's Psalms;--or the Wisdom of Him who made the everlasting
Gospel the mysterious four-fold thing it is?--Then, were she to do so, we should perforce exclaim,--This
judgment of thine cannot possibly be just! For the echo must resemble the voice which woke
it! Other spirits must have been intruding here; and the unholy din of their voices must have
drowned the clear, yet still and small utterance of ALMIGHTY GOD within thy breast!.... In
other words, if there be antagonism, Ethics,--not Theology, but (that which calls itself) Moral
Science,--must instantly and hopelessly give way.

For doubtless, that inference of ours as to what had happened, would be a true inference.--It
will be the fact, I fear, before the end of all things; for it seems to be implied,--(a more
heart-sickening sentence in all Scripture, I know not!),--that when the Son of Man cometh,
He will not find the Faith on the Earth[386]. And if not the Faith (τὴν πίστιν),--what then?
The Moral Sense? Hardly! for where was the Moral Sense when she let go the Faith?--It was the
fact, (if I read the record rightly,) eighteen centuries ago: for children had then forgotten
their duty to their Parents; and the sanctity of Marriage was unknown; and (O prime note of
a darkened conscience!) men not only did things worthy of Death, but "had pleasure in them
that did them." Read the first chapter of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and say what was
then the condition of the Moral Sense in man. Tell me, while your cheek is yet burning, whether
you think Moral Science was then competent to sit in judgment on a Revelation sent from the
GOD of Purity, until GOD's own SON had republished the sanctions of the Moral Law, and informed
Man's conscience afresh!... No Sirs. And why? Hear the Apostle! It was because "when they knew
GOD, they glorified Him not as GOD; neither were thankful:"--hence, they were suffered to become
vain in their imaginations, and, "their foolish heart was darkened!"--In other words, the candle
of the LORD, the light of conscience within them, was well nigh put out.

This will explain the reason why, when "THE WORD was made flesh and dwelt among us," He so
frequently delivered precepts,--yea, preached whole Sermons,--on what would now-a-days be called
mere "Morality." He was republishing the Moral Law. He was graving afresh those letters which
had been wellnigh worn out through tract of Time, and the wear and tear of Man's ungoverned
lusts.--Hence, to this hour, when question is raised of Right and Wrong,--the appeal is made,
by the common consent of Christian men, not to the inner consciousness of the creature, but
to the Creator's external Revelation of His mind and will. Let abler men explain to us what
we mean when we talk about Immutable Morality. I am by no means sure that I understand myself.
Sure only am I that it will carry us a very little way. Aristotle would never have made the
average moral sense of mankind his standard, had he known of a λόγος θεόπνευστος. The principles
of Morality do indeed seem to be fixed and eternal;--ἀεί ποτε ζῇ ταῦτα:--but it is no longer
true, οὐδεὶς οἶδεν ἐξ ὅτου 'φάνη. Ever since the Gospel came into the world, general opinion
has ceased to be the standard of Truth: for the Bible has simply superseded it; and put forth
a standard to which "general opinion" itself must bow. "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life."
So spake the Eternal SON while yet on Earth. And He foresaw that there would come a day when
the world would still ask, with Pilate, "What is Truth?" Accordingly, we heard his solemn reply
in this Morning's Second Lesson--"THY WORD,"--"THY WORD is Truth." ... "GOD made two great
lights," I grant you: but what I maintain is, that He made "the greater Light to rule the Day."

And therefore are we very bold to assert that it is all too late for men now to vaunt the authority
of the Moral Sense, as a thing to be set up against the fixed and immutable Revelation of GOD'S
mind and will. "The sufficiency of Natural Religion is a paradox of modern invention, and the
boast of it comes with an ill grace, and under great suspicions, so late in the day of trial[387]."
Aye, it comes all too late. Here in England, (GOD be praised!) the moral sense is indeed strong.
Is it as strong, think you, among those continental nations which are under the spiritual yoke
of Rome? Is it as strong among the Hindoos? Is it as strong among the savage inhabitants of
central Australia?... Perceive you not that if Moral Science speaks with a loud and clear voice
in Christian lands, it is because there the Moral Sense has been in those lands informed afresh
by Revelation? "That the principles of Natural Religion have come to be so far understood and
admitted, may fairly be taken for one of the effects of the Gospel[388]." The echoes of the
voice of GOD are now so distinct, only because GOD hath suffered His awful voice to be heard
on earth again: and if among ourselves those echoes are the loudest and the clearest, is it
not because among ourselves the Bible is read the most?

"The fact" (says the thoughtful writer already quoted,)--"the fact is not to be denied; the
Religion of Nature has had the opportunity of rekindling her faded taper by the Gospel light,--whether
furtively or unconsciously availed of. Let her not dissemble the obligation, and make a boast
of the splendour, as though it were originally her own; or had always, in her hands, been sufficient
for the illumination of the World."--"It is not to be imagined that men fail to profit by the
light that has been shed upon them, though they have not always the integrity to own the source
from which it comes; or though they may turn their back upon it, whilst it fills the very atmosphere
in which they move, with glory[389]."

I say, therefore, that it is all too late to vaunt the supremacy of Conscience as opposed to
Revelation,--Moral as opposed to Theological Science. Moral Science owes all its renewed strength
and vigour to Theology. And so, were Moral Science to dare call in question, (as she sometimes
has done, and may dare to do again!), the Morality of the Bible,--we should find her monstrous
image nowhere so fitly as in that of the man whose withered hand CHRIST healed in the Synagogue,--if
the same man had proved such a wretch, as straightway to lift up his arm with intention to
smite his Benefactor and his GOD.

Physical Science therefore, (for the last time!)--all the other Sciences,--Moral Science not
excepted,--are the handmaids of Theological Science: and Morality, to which we omitted before
to assign an office, we have stationed somewhere beneath the footstool, which is before the
Throne, of the Most High.--But this day's Sermon,--(and with these words I conclude, sorry
to have felt obliged to detain you so long!)--this Day's Sermon has had for its object to remind
you, that THE BIBLE is none other than the voice of Him that sitteth upon the Throne! Every
Book of it,--every Chapter of it,--every Verse of it,--every word of it,--every syllable of
it,--(where are we to stop?)--every letter of it--is the direct utterance of the Most High!--Πᾶσα

FOOTNOTES:

[330] Preached in Christ-Church Cathedral, 25th Nov. 1860.

[331] Πᾶσαι αἱ θεόπνευστοι γραφαί,--as it is worded in the Epistle sent by the Council of Antioch
in the case of Paul of Samosata, A.D. 269. (Routh Reliqq. iii. 292.) See Middleton on the Greek
Article, (Rose's ed.) in loc. And so, in effect, Wordsworth and Ellicott.--It is right to add
that it has been contended that πᾶσα γραφή = "the whole of Scripture." See Lee on Inspiration,
p. 263, (note.) So Athanasius seems to have taken it: Πᾶσα ἡ καθ' ἡμᾶς γραφὴ, παλαιά τε καὶ
καινὴ, θεόπνευστος ἐστι. (Ep. ad Marcell. i. 982.)

[332] That θεόπνευστος is the predicate, seems sufficiently obvious. So Athanasius, in the
passage above quoted. So Gregory of Nyssa: διὰ τοῦτο πᾶσα γραφὴ θεόπνευστος λέγεται, διὰ τὸ
τῆς θείας ἐμπνεύσεως εἶναι διδασκαλίαν. (Contr. Eunom. Orat. VI. ii. 605.) Amphilochius, Bishop
of Iconium, quotes the place in the same way.--Basil also, saying--Πᾶσα γραφὴ θεόπνευστος καὶ
ὠφέλιμος, διὰ τοῦτο συγγραφεῖσα παρὰ τοῦ Πνεύματος, (Hom. in Psalm. I. i. 90,)--clearly adopts
the construction assumed in the text.--Ambrose (De Spir. Sancto, lib. II. c. 16. ii. 688,)
says,--"In Scriptura Divina, θεόπνευστος omnis ex hoc dicitur, quod Deus inspiret quæ locutus
est Spiritus." (The above are from Lee on Inspiration, which see, pp. 260, 493, 599.)--Tertullian
(quoted by Tisch.) says, "Legimus omnem Scripturam ædificationi habilem, divinitus inspirari."--A
few modern scholars have suggested that θέοπν. may be an epithet, not a predicate. The doctrine
will remain the same either way; for the meaning of the place can only be, "Every Scripture,
being inspired, is also profitable," &c. This is Origen's view: but his criticism is not in
point, inasmuch as he read the text differently, (omitting the καί.) Lee aptly compares the
construction of πᾶν κτίσμα Θεοῦ καλὸν, καὶ οὐδὲν ἀπόβλητον. (1 Tim. iv. 4.)

[389] Davison's Discourses on Prophecy,--p. 8.--The following passage is from Bp. Horsley's
Primary Charge to the Clergy of Rochester, (1796,):--"The question in this case is not abstract,--what
Reason may have the ability to do. The question is upon a matter of fact,--what she did. Were
these things, in point of fact, man's own discovery?--The sacred history is explicit that they
were not. And notwithstanding the many useful lessons of Morality we find in the writings of
the heathen sages,--the many eloquent discourses upon providence, and the immortality of the
soul,--the many subtile disquisitions upon the great questions of necessity and moral freedom,
upon fate and chance,--I am persuaded, that had it not been for the early communications of
the Creator with mankind, Man never would have raised the conceptions of his mind to the idea
of a God; he never would have dreamt of the immaterial principle within himself; and he never
would have formed any general notions of Right and Wrong in the abstract; he would have had
no Religion, perhaps no Morality.... The prudent dispensers of the Word will resort to Revelation
for his first principles, as well as for more mysterious truths. He will not trust to philosophy
for any discoveries. He will suffer philosophy to be nothing more than his assistant in the
study of the inspired Word. She must herself be instructed by those lively oracles before she
can be qualified to take part in the instruction of men. To lay the foundation of Revelation
upon any previous discoveries of Reason, is in fact to make Reason the superior teacher. It
is not improbable, that Idolatry itself had its first beginning in an early adoration of this
phantom of Natural Religion,--the idol, in later ages, of impolitic metaphysical Divines."--Charges,

ST. JOHN xvii. 17.

Thy Word is Truth.

I thankfully avail myself of the opportunity which, unexpected and unsolicited, so soon presents
itself, to proceed with the subject which was engaging our attention when I last occupied this
place.

Let me remind you of the nature of the present inquiry, and of the progress which we have already
made.

Taking Holy Scripture for our subject, and urging, as best we knew how, its paramount claims
on the daily attention of the younger men,--who at present are our hope and ornament; to be
hereafter, as we confidently believe, our very crown and joy;--even while we held in our hands
that volume which our Fathers were content to call the volume of Inspiration, we were constrained
to recollect that its claim to be inspired has of late years been repeatedly called in question.
It has even become the fashion to cavil at almost everything which the Bible contains. We are
grown so exceedingly wise, have made so many strange discoveries, and have become so clear-sighted,
that the more advanced among us are kindly bent on disabusing the minds of their less gifted
brethren of that most venerable delusion of all,--(for it is coeval with Christianity,)--that
the Bible is in any special sense the Word of GOD. I do not say that Theologians talk thus.
But pretenders to Natural Science, knowing nothing whatever of Divinity, and therefore intruding
into a realm of which they do not understand so much as the language;--together with, (sad
to relate!) men bearing a commission in the Church of CHRIST, (and who ought therefore to be
building up, where they are seeking to destroy,)--are employing the powers which GOD has given
them, in this direction. It becomes indispensable, in consequence, that we should say somewhat
on behalf of those Oracles which have been so vigorously impugned; and it should not seem strange
if we oppose to such destructive dogmatism, the most uncompromising severity of counter statement.

The objections which have been raised against the Bible, although they have been industriously
gleaned from various quarters, will all be most effectually met, I am persuaded, by getting
men to acquaint themselves with the contents of the deposit itself. And yet, inasmuch as it
is the nature of doubts, when once injected into the mind, to fester and to spread; inasmuch
also as the bold confidence of plausible assertion, especially when recommended by men of reputation,
and set off with some ability and skill, is apt to impose on youth and inexperience;--we seem
reduced to a kind of necessity, to examine; and, as far as the limits of a sermon will allow,
to refute; the charges which have been so industriously brought forward against the Bible.

The favourite objections of the day come partly from without,--partly from within. The classification
is not exact, but it may serve to assist the memory. One class of objections is, in a manner,
destructive,--for it results in entire disbelief of the Bible:--the other class, suggesting
imperfections, results in a low and disparaging estimate of its contents. When exception is
taken against certain portions of Holy Scripture, on the ground of discoveries in Physical
Science,--of the dictates of the Moral Sense,--of the supremacy of mechanical Laws,--and the
like,--we consider that the supposed difficulties come from without. As much as we care to
say on this class of objections has either been already offered, or must be reserved for a
subsequent occasion[391].--When doubts are insinuated, arising out of the subject-matter of
the Bible, we consider the difficulties to proceed from within. The apparent contradictions
of the Evangelists, are of this nature. Supposed errors or misstatements, come under the same
head. Very imperfectly, yet sufficiently for our immediate purpose, we have touched upon both
subjects. Those portions of the Old Testament which savour in the highest degree of the marvellous,
must be reserved for separate consideration[392]. To-day I propose to speak of another kind
of objection; but which arises, like the others, out of the subject-matter of the Bible. Moreover,
it is the kind of difficulty which most readily presents itself to any who listened with unwilling
ears to my last discourse. Some here present may remember my repeated and unequivocal assertion
that Holy Scripture is inspired from the Alpha to the Omega of it;--not some parts more, some
parts less, but all equally, and all to overflowing;--that we hold it to be, not generally
inspired, but particularly; that we see not how with logical consistency we can avoid believing
the words as well as the sentences of it; the syllables as well as the words; the letters as
well as the syllables; every "jot" and every "tittle" of it, (to use our LORD'S expression,)
to be divinely inspired:--and further, that until the contrary has been proved, we shall maintain
that no misapprehension or misstatement, no error or blot of any kind, can possibly exist within
its pages:--that we hold the Bible to be as much the Word of GOD, as if GOD spoke to us therein
with human lips;--and that, as the very utterance of the HOLY GHOST, we cannot but think that
it must be absolute, faultless, unerring, supreme.

I. To this, it has been objected as follows:--

You cannot possibly mean what you say. You will not pretend to assert that the list of the
Dukes of Edom[393], is as much inspired,--inspired in the same sense,--as the Gospel of St.
John.--To which I make answer, that I believe one to be just as much inspired as the other:
and before I leave off, I will endeavour to bring my hearers to the same opinion. In the meantime,
it is only fair to the objector, to hear him out: to follow his guidance; and to see whither
he would lead us. It will be quite competent for us then to retrace our steps; to point out
"a more excellent way;" and to entreat him, with all a brother's earnestness, to reconsider
the matter, and to follow us.

The objection may, I believe, be fairly stated as follows.--It is unreasonable to consider
any part of Holy Scripture inspired which the author was competent to write without the aid
of Inspiration. Just as you would not multiply miracles needlessly, and ascribe to special
Divine interference results which might be otherwise accounted for, so neither ought you to
call in the aid of Inspiration where it may clearly be dispensed with. A genealogy,--a catalogue
of names, whether of places or persons,--whatever may reasonably be suspected to have been
an extract from public Archives;--nothing of this sort need you, nor indeed, properly speaking,
can you, call "inspired." More than that. All mere narratives of ordinary transactions,--or
indeed of transactions extraordinary;--whatever, in short, a writer, having first beheld it
with his eyes, appears to have simply described with his pen, it is unreasonable to regard
as the work of Inspiration. For it is plain to common sense,--(so at least I have heard it
said,) that there is much, both in the Old and in the New Testament, the delivery of which
required no other than the ordinary gifts of men:--actual observation, good memory, high intellect,
clearness of statement, honesty of purpose. Look at the preface to St. Luke's Gospel. It seems
only to convey that the author of it believed himself to be bringing out a superior edition
of a narrative which had already been attempted by many. I would apply, (it is said,) to the
whole of the Old Testament the same observations which I apply to the New. There are parts
which evidently required nothing but opportunity of experience, or research, and the ordinary
qualities of a trustworthy historian.--This then is the way the case is put. There is no intentional
irreverence on the part of the objector: no conscious hostility to GOD'S Truth. Very much the
reverse. But having once assumed that the catalogue of the Dukes of Edom is not to be regarded
as an inspired document, he has logical consistency enough to perceive that he cannot exactly
stop there. And so, he carries his speculations a little further. He tries to take (what he
calls) a "common sense" view of the question. He says that he thinks it a dangerous proceeding
on the part of the preacher to insist on the infallibility of Apostles and Evangelists. Meanwhile,
I suspect that he is not by any means without a suspicion that he is on a platform beset with
far greater dangers, himself. He has walked a little this way, and that way; and his "common
sense" has shewn him that there is an ugly precipice on every side. Nay; he perceives that
the ground trembles, and cracks, and shakes,--and even yawns beneath his feet.

For I request you to observe, that there is absolutely no middle state between Inspiration
and non-inspiration. If a writing be inspired, it is Divine: if it be not inspired, it is human.
It is absurd to shirk the alternative. Some parts of the Bible, it is allowed, are inspired;
other parts, it is contended, are not. Let it be conceded then, for the moment, that the catalogue
of the Dukes of Edom is not an inspired writing; and let it be ejected from the Bible accordingly.
We must by strict parity of reasoning, eject the xth chapter of Genesis, which enumerates the
descendants of Japheth, of Ham, and of Shem, with the countries which they severally occupied,--that
truly venerable record and outline of the primæval settlement of the nations! The ten Patriarchs
before, and the ten after Noah: the many enumerations contained in the Book of Numbers: much
of the two Books of Chronicles: together with the Genealogies of our SAVIOUR as given by St.
Matthew and St. Luke.

It is clear that the history of the Flood,--very much of it at least,--is of the same nature:
a kind of calendar as it were, and record of dates.

But we may go on faster, and use the knife far more freely. Every thing in the Pentateuch of
which Moses had been an eye or ear-witness, and which he set down from his own personal knowledge,
may be eliminated from the Bible, as not inspired. According to the principle already enunciated
by yourself, I call upon you to excise from the Book of GOD'S Law, Exodus, and Leviticus, and
Numbers, and Deuteronomy: those passages only excepted which are prophetical,--as the xxxiiird
of Deuteronomy. Joshua must go of course: for if the son of Nun did not write the Book which
goes under his name,--(as the wise men in Germany say, or used to say, he did not[394],)--of
course the narrative is not authentic; and if he did, you say that it ought not to be regarded
as inspired. The Books of Samuel and of Kings cannot be claimed as the work of Inspiration,
of course. Chronicles we have got rid of already. No imaginable plea can be invented for the
Books of Ezra, of Nehemiah, and of Esther; those writings having evidently required nothing
(to use your own phrase) but "opportunity of experience or research, and the ordinary qualities
of a trustworthy historian." We expunge those portions only which are simply historical and
moral; since to these, by the hypothesis, the spirit of Inspiration cannot be thought to have
extended.

We come now to the New Testament; and two of the Gospels are found to be mutilated already,
by the elimination of one chapter of St. Matthew and one of St. Luke. But on the principle
that personal observation, a good memory, honesty of purpose, and so forth, are the only requirements
necessary, we may proceed to carry forward the work of excision with spirit, so that we be
but careful to use discernment. For example, we may begin with the Call of St. Matthew, and
the Feast which he made to our LORD in his own house. Who so competent to relate this, as the
Evangelist himself? Whenever, in short, the Twelve were present, St. Matthew, (as one of the
Twelve,) may be assumed to have written from personal observation; and that portion of his
narrative is to be rejected accordingly as uninspired.

It is painful to anticipate what will be the fate of St. John's Gospel, on this principle,--together
with most of the Divine Discourses therein recorded. Not, to be sure, that we shall lose the
conversation with Nicodemus, nor that with the woman of Samaria; because St. John was not present
when either of those conversations took place: but all, from the xivth to the xviith chapter
inclusive; as well as the discourse in the vith chapter, must of course be dismissed. The matter
of these discourses, it will be urged,--(with more of logical consistency, alas! than of essential
truth,)--might have been faithfully handed down by St. John without any extraordinary gift.
He was bound to our LORD by more than ordinary affection. He was ever nearest to Him. Is it
not conceivable, (we are asked,) that these two causes, aided by a retentive memory, would
at least enable him to give us the record which he has given?

Quite superfluous must it be to state that the Acts of the Apostles, under the expurgatory
process which now engages our attention, will cease to be regarded as an inspired Book; and
therefore must be at once disconnected from the confessedly inspired portions of Holy Scripture.--St.
Paul's Epistles, you say, on the contrary, are probably inspired, and therefore are probably
to be spared.... And I really think we need go no further. If your own handling of Holy Scripture,--your
own method, by yourself applied,--be not a reductio ad absurdum, I know of nothing in the world
which is.... Look only at that handful of mutilated pages in the hands of one who is supposed
to be the impersonation of "common sense;" turn the tattered and mangled leaves over and over,
which you are pleased to call the Volume of Inspiration; and get all the comfort and help out
of it you can. But be not surprised to hear that you are exposing yourself to the ridicule
of the sane part of Mankind,--even while haply you are acting a part which makes the Angels
weep.... How much of the Bible will remain, when Science, (Physical, Moral, Historical,) has
further done her work, I forbear now to inquire: but I shrewdly suspect that she will leave
you very little beyond the back and the covers.

Let us not be told, (as we doubtless shall,) that the human parts of Scripture need not be
ejected from the Canon because they are human: that they may be allowed to stand with the rest,
although uninspired; and the like. About this, we at least are competent judges. We are now
bent on discovering how much of Holy Scripture is the Word of GOD; and we refuse, for the moment,
to regard as such, and to retain, a single passage which, being (as you say) uninspired, is
simply the word of Man.

II. Let me now be permitted to lay before you a somewhat different view of the office of Inspiration.
Since the illumination of Science, falsely so called, and the process of Common Sense, would
seem to have resulted in the extinction of the deposit, I ask your patience while I try to
shew, that common sense, informed by a somewhat loftier Theological Instinct, may give such
an account of the matter as will enable us to preserve every word of the deposit entire.

You call my attention to the catalogue of the Dukes of Edom, and tell me that it required no
supernatural aid to enable Moses to write it. How, may I ask, do you ascertain that fact? No
specimens of the documentary evidence of the land of Seir in the days of Moses, are known now
to exist on the earth's surface. You therefore know absolutely nothing whatever about the matter
of which you speak so confidently.

But, that we may grapple with the question fairly, let us come down from an age concerning
which neither of us knows anything beyond what the Bible teaches, to a period with which all
are familiar, and to documents of which we know at least a little. It will suit your purpose
far better that you should instance the two Genealogies of our LORD,--of which you also say
that it is impossible to maintain that they exhibit the work of Inspiration in the same sense
as when some lofty statement of Christian doctrine comes before us. Indeed, you deny that they
are inspired at all. I, on my side, am willing to admit that it is quite possible,--even probable,--that
the first and the third Evangelist had access to extant documents of which they respectively
availed themselves, when they recorded our LORD'S descent.

But, do you not perceive that the great underlying fallacy in all you have been saying, is
your own wholly gratuitous assumption that you are a competent judge of what did,--what did
not,--require supernatural aid to deliver? that whatever seems as if it might have been written
without Inspiration, was therefore written without it?--I see so many practical inconveniences,
or rather I see such glaring absurdity, resulting from the supposition that Inspiration goes
and comes before an authentic document, that I am constrained to think that you are altogether
mistaken in the office which you assign to Inspiration,--in the kind of notion which you seem
to entertain concerning its nature.

An Evangelist, if you please, is inspired. It becomes necessary to introduce a genealogy. Following
the Divine guidance, (the nature of which, neither you nor I know anything at all about,) he
applies in a certain quarter, and obtains access to a certain document. Or he repairs to a
well-known repository of public archives, and out of the whole collection he is guided to make
choice of one particular writing. He proceeds to transcribe it,--omitting names (dropping three
generations for instance,)--or inserting names (the second Cainan for example,)--or, if you
please, neither omitting nor inserting anything. The document, (suppose,) requires no correction
whatever.--Well but, this man was inspired a moment ago, in what he was writing; and no reason
has been shewn why he should not be inspired still. He has adopted a document, by incorporating
it into his narrative. By transcribing it, he has made it his own. I am at a loss to see that
its claim to be an inspired writing, from that moment forward, is in any respect inferior to
the rest of the narrative in which it stands. All I am contending for now, is, that this is
at least as true of one part of the Gospel as of another: that if it be true of anything in
the Gospel, it is at least as true of the Genealogy of CHRIST. The subject-matter indeed is
different; but it is a mere confusion of thought to infer therefrom a different degree of Inspiration.
Let me try and make this plainer by a few familiar illustrations.

1. When the Sovereign reads a speech from the Throne, does she speak the words of it in any
different sense from the words of a speech which she has herself composed?--Nay, are words
of investiture, mere words of form and state, in any less degree spoken, than words of confidence,
and private friendship?

2. Again. The substance of paper and the substance of gold, are widely different. And yet,
when paper has been subjected to a certain process, and stamped with a certain impress, there
is practically no difference whatever between the value of what was, a moment ago, absolutely
worthless, and an ingot of the purest gold.

3. Consider how the case stands with a merely human author. An historian has occasion to introduce
into his narrative the descent of a House, or the preamble of an Act, or any other lifeless
thing. Does his responsibility cease when he comes to it, and recommence immediately afterwards?
Is he not responsible just to the same extent for that, as for every other part of his story?

That he did not compose it himself, is certain: but neither did he compose the sayings which
he has recorded of great men.--True also is it that the edification to be derived from the
pedigree is not so great,--certainly, not so obvious,--as from certain of the events which
he describes. But it is nevertheless henceforth an integral part of his history. He sought
for it,--and he found it: he weighed it,--and he approved of it: he transcribed it,--and he
interwove it into his narrative. In a word, he adopted; and by adopting, he made it his own.
Henceforth, it will be quoted as authentic, because it is found to have satisfied him.

The utmost praise which can be accorded to any creature is, that it thoroughly fulfils the
office whereunto God sends it. A genealogy is not intended to make men wise unto Salvation:
the threats and promises of GOD'S Law are not intended to acquaint men with the descent of
David's Son. But because their offices are different, it does not follow that their origin
shall not he the same! Is a shoe-latchet in any sense less an article manufactured by Man,
than a watch? Is the Archangel Michael, burning with glory, and intent on some celestial enterprise,
with twelve legions of glittering seraphs in his train;--is such a host as that, one atom more
a creation of the ALMIGHTY than the handful of yellow leaves which flutter unheeded on the blast?

None of these figures present a strict parallel; and yet, successively, they seem to set forth
different aspects of the same case, with sufficient vividness and truth.... So bent am I on
conveying to your minds the strong sense of certainty, the clear definite view, which I cherish
for myself on this subject, that I take leave to add yet another illustration.

4. If I commission a Servant to deliver a message,--is not the message which he delivers mine?
If I give him words to deliver,--are not the words which he delivers mine? So obvious a proposition
is no matter of opinion. You cannot deny it. Nor,--(to apply the illustration to the matter
in hand,)--nor do you deny it, probably, so far as Prophecy, (in the popular sense of the term,)
is concerned: but you begin to doubt, it seems, when any other function of the prophetic office
is in question. "Any other function," I say; for, (as all men ought to be aware,) a prophet,--(navē
in Hebrew, προφήτης in Greek,)--does not, by any means, of necessity imply one who describes
future events. Πρό does not denote futurity of time, but vicariousness of office. The προ-φήτης
is one who speaketh πρό, "on behalf of," "in the person of," GOD; whether declaring things
past,--(as when Moses describes the Creation of the World, the Fall of Man, the Patriarchal
Age): things present,--(as when St. Luke, "having had perfect understanding of all things from
the very first," writes of them "in order"): things future,--(as when David, and Isaiah, and
the rest of the goodly fellowship, "testified beforehand the sufferings of CHRIST, and the
glory that should follow[396].") This is no arbitrary statement, but a well-known fact, which
modern unbelievers and ancient heathen writers have declared with sufficient plainness[397].
So long then as the message which the Servant delivers is prophetic, you do not object to the
notion that it is GOD'S message; nay, that the words spoken are GOD'S words. You begin to doubt,
it seems, when a collection of genealogies, (as the two Books of Chronicles;) or when a story
like that contained in the Book of Esther is concerned.

But what is this but very trifling, and mere childishness? The message may be mine, it seems,
if it be of a lofty character: it may not be mine if it be of a homely, ordinary kind!--I send
a message by my Servant, and he delivers it faithfully: but whether it is to be called my message,
or is not to be called my message, is to depend entirely on the subject-matter!... Thus, if
a King, refusing to appear in person, should issue a reprieve to prisoners under sentence of
Death, a proclamation of Peace or of War, an address to the representatives of the constitution,
(Clergy, Lords, and Commons,) in parliament assembled,--the message would be his. But if, on
the contrary, he were only to send a few homely words, the expression of some wish or intention
which has nothing that seems particularly royal in it,--then, the message would cease to be
his!... I protest that as I am unable to see the reasonableness of such a method of regarding
things human, so am I at a loss to understand why men should so regard things Divine.

5. This entire matter may be usefully illustrated by having recourse to an analogy which was
established on a former occasion: namely, the analogy between the Written and the Incarnate
Word[398]. That our LORD JESUS CHRIST is at once very GOD and very Man, we all fully admit;
although the manner of the union of GODHEAD and Manhood in His one Person we confess ourselves
quite unable to comprehend. Even so, that there is a human as well as a Divine element in Holy
Scripture,--who so blind as to overlook? who so weak as to deny? And yet, to dissect out that
human element,--who (but a fool) so rash as to attempt?... To apply this to the matter before
us. Certain parts of Holy Scripture you think, (for reasons to yourself best known,) are not
to be looked upon as inspired in the same sense as the rest of the volume. Just as reasonably
might you try to persuade me that our SAVIOUR was not in the same sense our SAVIOUR when He
ate and drank at the Pharisees' board, as when He cast out devils and raised the dead. Was
He not equally the Incarnate WORD at every stage of His earthly career; from the time that
He was laid in the manger, until the instant when He expired upon the Cross? The degradation
which He endured in Pilate's judgment-hall did not affect the reality of the great truth that
the GODHEAD was indissolubly joined to the Manhood in His Person. He was not less very GOD
as well as very Man when some one spat upon Him, than at His Transfiguration and at His Ascension
into Heaven!... Why then should the mean aspect and lowly office of certain parts of Scripture,--(genealogical
details and the narrative of what we think ordinary occurrences,)--be supposed to disentitle
those parts to the praise of being as fully inspired as any thing in the whole compass of the
Bible?

I may remind you, in passing, that the narrative of Scripture, even in its humblest, and (to
all appearance) most human parts, has a perpetual note of Divinity set upon it. The historical
portions are throughout interspersed with indications that the writer is beholding the transactions
which he records, from a Divine, (not a human,) point of view. GOD is invariably, (sooner or
later,) mentioned as the Agent; or there is some reference made to GOD; or to GOD'S Word.

I entreat you therefore to disabuse your minds of the very weak,--aye and very fatal,--notion
that the catalogue of the Dukes of Edom is less, or in any different sense, inspired, from
the rest of the narrative in which it stands. We may not multiply miracles needlessly, it is
true; but neither may we deny the miraculous character of certain transactions, (as the two
Draughts of Fishes,) which, apart from the recorded attendant circumstances, would not have
been deemed miraculous.--In truth, however, Holy Scripture, in one sense, is a miracle from
end to end; and if we may not multiply miracles needlessly, certainly we are not at liberty
to dismiss the recorded details of a single miracle, as of no account.--Consider also, I entreat
you, whether it is credible that Inspiration should be a thing of such a nature, that it comes
and goes,--is here and is gone,--once and again in the course of a single page. What? does
it vanish, like lightning, when the Evangelist's pen has to record the title on the Cross,--to
re-appear the instant afterwards?

This allusion to the title on the Cross of our Blessed LORD, variously given by each of the
four Evangelists, reminds me of the singular perversity of mankind when this subject of Inspiration
is being treated of; and to this, I now particularly desire to invite your attention.--When
a document is simply transcribed by the Evangelist, or may be supposed to have been merely
transferred to his pages, men assert that so purely mechanical an act precludes the notion
that Inspiration has had any share in the transaction. Be it so!--Behold now, four inspired
writers exhibiting the brief title on our LORD'S Cross with considerable verbal diversity;
and you will hear the same critics open-mouthed against the Evangelists' claim to Inspiration,
for exactly the opposite reason!--It is just so of places quoted from the Old Testament in
the New. Faithful transcription, (we are told,) is in the power of all. What note of an inspired
author have we here? But the places are not faithfully transcribed. On the contrary. They exhibit
every possible degree of deflection from the original standard. And lo, the Apostles of CHRIST
are thought not to have quite understood Greek,--to have mistaken the sense of the Hebrew,--and
to have been the victims of a most capricious memory.--For the last time. Certain narrative
portions of Holy Scripture, (it is assumed,) could have been written without the aid of Inspiration;
and therefore it is unphilosophical, (we are told,) to assign to them a divine original. But
the marvellous parts of Holy Scripture, which seem to claim a loftier original than man's unaided
wit,--these you view with suspicion, or you deny!... "Whereunto shall I liken the men of this
generation?"

Before dismissing the subject, I must ask you to observe, that this arbitrary, irreverent method
of approaching Holy Scripture, is absolutely fatal; and can result in nothing but general unbelief.
It confessedly leaves the individual reader to decide what parts of the Bible he thinks could,
what parts could not, have been written without Divine assistance;--a point on which I am bold
to say that he is not competent even to form an opinion. In other words, it constitutes every
man the judge of how much of the Bible he will retain,--how much he will reject. To put the
case yet more plainly, it makes every man a GOD to himself, and the maker of his own Bible.--For,
mark you, the exceptions taken against a genealogy, or a catalogue of names, are just as applicable
to the account of our LORD'S Discourses as given by St. John. Once convince me that the function
of Inspiration ceases when a genealogy has to be set down,--because (say you) it requires no
Inspiration to enable an Evangelist to copy written words;--and I shall have no difficulty
in convincing myself that St. John's Gospel, from the xivth to the xviith chapters inclusive,
is not inspired,--because I cannot but infer that then neither can it require Inspiration to
enable an Evangelist to copy spoken words.--The original fallacy, I repeat,--the πρῶτον ψεῦδος,--consists
in your supposing yourself a competent judge of the nature and office of Inspiration; concerning
which, in reality, you know nothing. You can but reverently examine the phenomena of the Book
of Inspiration; remembering that you have everything to learn.

The Bible, it cannot be too often repeated, too clearly borne in mind,--the Bible must stand
or fall,--or rather, be received or rejected,--as a whole. A Divinity hath over-ruled it, that
those many Books of which it is composed should come to be spoken of collectively as if they
were one Book. As it was formerly called ἡ γραφή--"the Scripture,"--so is it happily called
"the Bible"--(the Book)--now. "Moses--the Prophets--and the Psalms," was the recognized analysis
of the volume of the Old Testament. The Gospels, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse, exhibits
the sum of the contents of the New.--There is no disjoining the Law from the Gospel. There
is no disconnecting one Book from its fellows. There is no eliminating one chapter from the
rest. There is no taking exception against one set of passages, or supposing that Inspiration
has anywhere forgotten her office, or discharged it imperfectly. All the Books of the Bible
must stand or fall together. "Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it[400]." It
is a fabric hard as adamant; and the gates of Hell will assuredly never prevail against it.
But remove in thought a single stone; and in thought, that goodly work of Lawgivers and Judges--Kings
and Prophets--Evangelists and Apostles,--collapses into a shapeless and unmeaning ruin[401].

Nor may it occasion perplexity, or breed mistrust in any thoughtful mind to find this Book
of GOD'S Law so complex in its character,--so various in its contents,--so fruitful in its
difficulties. Might it not, on the contrary, have been expected beforehand, that some analogy
would have been recognizable between the general complexion of GOD'S Works and of GOD'S Word?
While I behold the creatures of GOD so various,--their functions so marvellous,--their nature
so little understood,--the very purpose of their creation so great a mystery;--shall I think
it strange that that Book which is but another expression of GOD'S Mind and Will, proves diverse
in texture, and difficult of interpretation?--Shall I grow rebellious against the message,
because the history of it is hid in the long night of ages; say rather, in the counsels of
GOD'S inscrutable will? or shall I be incredulous that it comes from Heaven, because I see
the fingers of a Man's hand writing upon the plaister of the wall? or shall I despise those
parts of it of which I cannot detect the medicinal value? As there are riddles in Nature, so
are there riddles in Grace. Anomalies too, it may be, are discoverable in both worlds.--Give
me leave to add, that as the microscope reveals unsuspected wonders in the one, so does minute
examination bring to light undreamed of perfections in the other also; unimagined proofs of
divine wisdom, and skill.... But beyond all things, there is perhaps this further thing which
it behoves us to consider:--that the field of either is very vast; the subject-matter very
complex: and as, in one, many Professors are needed,--(for the Animal kingdom and the Vegetable
kingdom are realms apart: the analysis of substances, and the structure of the Earth demand
the undivided attention of different minds;)--so does it fare with the other also. The languages
of Scripture are in themselves a mighty study; and the collation of the Text is the portion
of a long life. The Law of Moses would abundantly engross the time of one who should undertake
to explain its depths; as the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST would assuredly fill to overflowing the
soul of another who should desire to appreciate its perfections. The Prophetic writings are
a distinct field of labour. The same may well be said of the Epistles of St. Paul. It would
be easy to multiply departments--; for I have said nothing yet of Sacred History; and above
all, of Sacred Exegesis. But enough has been stated to introduce the remark that considering
how slenderly one man is able to labour in all these various provinces, it behoves each one
of us to be humble; and certainly to be a vast deal more mistrustful of ourselves than some
of us unhappily seem to be; especially when the errand on which we propose to come abroad is
the assailing of the authenticity, or the morality, or the integrity, or the Inspiration, of
any part of the Bible.

And this brings me naturally back to the subject of my first Sermon from this place; and enables
me to conclude, as I began, with an earnest entreaty to the younger men present, that,--whatever
their future destination in life may be,--but especially if the Ministry is to be their high
privilege, (and the blessedness of that choice they can have no idea of, until they prove it
by experience!);--an entreaty, I say, that they would now be assiduous, and earnest, and regular,
and punctual, and devout, in their daily study of one chapter of the Bible.--And while you
read the Bible, read it believing that you are reading an inspired Book:--not a Book inspired
in parts only, but a Book inspired in every part:--not a Book unequally inspired, but all inspired
equally:--not a Book generally inspired,--the substance indeed given by the Spirit, but the
words left to the option of the writers; but the words of it, as well as the matter of it,
all--all given by GOD.

I illustrated sufficiently, last time, in what way fulness of Inspiration is consistent with
the expression of individual character: even while I availed myself of the ancient illustration
that an inspired writer is like an instrument in the harper's hand[403]. I did not, of course,
"intend thereby to affirm that the Writers of Holy Scripture were constrained to write, without
any volition or consciousness on their part.... ALMIGHTY GOD, while He inspired the Writers
of Scripture, did not impair their moral and intellectual faculties, nor destroy their personal
identity[404]." Let me not be told therefore that this is to advocate a mechanical theory of
Interpretation. Theory I have none[405]. The Bible comes to me as the Word of GOD; and, as
the Word of GOD, (the LORD being my helper!) I will receive it. I should as soon think of holding
a theory of Providence and Freewill, as of holding a theory of Inspiration. I believe in Providence.
I know that I am a free agent. And that is enough for me.--The case of Inspiration seems strictly
parallel. I believe in the Divine origin of the Bible. I see that the writers of the several
books wrote like men.... That outer circle of causation, which, leaving each individual will
entirely free, so controuls without coercing, so overrules without occasioning, the actions
of men,--that all things shall work together for good in the end, and the great designs of
GOD'S Providence find free accomplishment;--all this, far, far transcends your and my powers
of comprehension. It is as much beyond us as Heaven is higher than the Earth. And, in like
manner, we must be content to own that Inspiration,--the analysis of which is so favourite
a problem with this inquisitive age,--is far, far above us likewise. To St. Luke "it seemed
good" to write a Gospel; and doubtless he held high communing on the subject,--which may, or
may not, have sounded like ordinary human converse,--with St. Paul. St. Mark in like sort,
beyond a question, enjoyed the help of St. Peter, while he wrote his Gospel. But St. Peter
and St. Mark, and St. Paul and St. Luke, were all alike,--however unconsciously,--held by the
Ancient of Days within the hollow of His palm; and, as Augustine says,--"Whatsoever He willed
that we should read concerning His acts and sayings,--that He commissioned the Evangelists
to write,--as though it had been Himself that wrote it[406]."--The guidance was remote, I grant
you. The mechanism which moved the pens of those blessed writers was far above out of their
sight; and complex beyond anything which the mind of man can imagine; (so that the publican
lisped of "gold, and silver, and brass[407];"--and the companion of St. Peter, at Rome, wrote
Latin words in Greek letters[408];--and the Physician of Antioch withheld the statement that
the woman who had spent all that she had in consulting many physicians, "was nothing bettered,
but rather grew worse[409];"--and the beloved disciple perhaps indulged his own personal love
while he recalled so largely the discourses of his LORD:)--but, for all that, the long sequence
of cause and effect existed; and the other end of that golden chain which terminated in the
man, and the pen, and the ink, and the paper,--the other end of it, I say, was held fast within
the Hand of GOD.--The method of Inspiration is but another of the many thousand marvels which
on every side surround me; one of the many things I cannot fully understand, much less pretend
to explain. But I may at least believe it in silence, and adore[410].

And,--(forgive me for keeping you so long; but I cannot let you go until I have emptied my
heart a little more on this great, and most concerning subject;)--mark you, Sirs, however reluctant
some of you may be to admit that you agree with me, you do agree with me,--almost to a man.
For, what mean your reasonings on Holy Scripture,--your sermons, and your dissertations, and
your catechizings,--your formulæ of belief, and your definitions of Faith,--except you believe
in a vast deal more than the substance of Holy Scripture? How can you pretend to expound a
text, unless you hold the words of that text to be inspired? What inferences can you venture
to draw from words, the Divinity of which you dare not affirm? O, to what endless, hopeless
scepticism are you pointing the way! What a variety of most unanswerable questionings will
you provoke! How can you hope ever to convince or convict, if you begin by acquainting your
adversary that it is only for the substantial verity of Scripture that you claim Inspiration;
the verbal details being quite a different matter! See you not that you put into his hands
a weapon with which he will infallibly slay yourself? Did the Bishops and Doctors of the Church,
when they met in solemn Council,--did they hold such a theory concerning Holy Scripture, think
you, as that the matter of it alone is Divine,--the language human? More briefly, that the
words of Scripture are not inspired? What then mean their weighty definitions of Doctrine;--GOD
the FATHER, "Maker of Heaven and Earth,"--GOD the SON, "by whom all things were made:"--the
SON, "Θεὸς ἐκ Θεοῦ,"--"being of one substance with the FATHER:"--"incarnate by the HOLY GHOST
of the Virgin Mary:"--who "descended into Hell"--"whose kingdom shall have no end:"--the HOLY
GHOST, "τὸ Κύριον καὶ τὸ ξωοποίον," "who proceeded from the FATHER and the SON?"--What means
every article of that Creed to which you and I have given our unfeigned assent, and which Athanasius
would have gladly subscribed to,--the most precious jewel in the Church's casket!--Nay, what
means St. Paul's commentary on the history of Melchizedek, if the very words omitted from Holy
Scripture are not a Divine omission?

You will perhaps be told hereafter, (I am speaking now to the younger men,) that quite fatal
to this view of the question, is the state of the Text of Scripture: that no one can maintain
that the words of Scripture are inspired, because no one can tell for certain what the words
of Scripture are; or something to that effect. Now I will not stop to expose the falsity of
this charge against the text of Scripture; (which is implied to be a very corrupt text, whereas,
on the contrary, it is the best ascertained text of any ancient writing in the world.) Rather
let me remind you, once and for ever, how to refute this silly sophism,--the transparent fallacy
of which one would have thought unworthy of exposure before men of trained understandings;
but that one hears it urged so often and so confidently. See you not that the state of the
text of the Bible has no more to do with the Inspiration of the Bible, than the stains on yonder
windows have to do with the light of GOD'S Sun? Let me illustrate the matter,--(though it surely
cannot need illustration!)--by supposing the question raised whether Livy did or did not write
the history which goes under his name. You, (suppose,) are persuaded that he did,--I, that
he did not. So far, we should both understand, and perhaps respect one another. But what if
I were to go on to condemn your opinion as untenable, because of the corrupt state of Livy's
text? Would you not reply that I mistook the question entirely: that you were speaking of the
authorship of the work,--not about the fate of the copies! ... Suppose, however, I were to
contend that Livy may indeed have furnished the matter of his history, but that the form of
expression must needs have been supplied by some one else; still on the same ground of the
corrupt state of the historian's text. What would you think of me then?--a man who not only
confounded two things utterly dissimilar,--(the authorship of a book, and the amount of care
with which it had been transcribed and printed;)--but who was for distinguishing the mind of
the writer from the expression of that mind; the thoughts, from the words which are essential
to their transmission! A hopelessly illogical person, surely!

O no, Sirs! Banish the fancy at once and for ever from your minds. You cannot thus dissect
Inspiration into substance and form. It is a mere delusion of these last days,--prated of from
man to man, until respectable persons begin to give in to the fallacy; and persuade themselves
that they themselves believe it. They hope thus to avoid the danger which is supposed to attach
to hearty belief in the Bible as the very Word of GOD; as well as to secure for themselves
a side-door, (so to speak,) by which to escape, whenever they are inconveniently hard pressed.
How much more faithful, to leave GOD to take care of His own! How much more manly, to be prepared
sometimes to confess ignorance!... As for thoughts being inspired, apart from the words which
give them expression,--you might as well talk of a tune without notes, or a sum without figures.
No such dream can abide the daylight for a moment. No such theory of Inspiration, (for a theory
it is, and a most audacious one too!), is even intelligible. It is as illogical as it is worthless;
and cannot be too sternly put down. The philosophical mind of Greece, (far better taught!),
knew of only one word for both Reason and the expression of it. Lodged within the chambers
of the brain, or put forth into living energy,--it was still, with them, the Λόγος.--I invite
you, as the only intelligible view of the matter,--your only alternative, unless you resolve
to run the risk of the most irrational rationalism,--to take this high view of Inspiration:
to believe, concerning the Bible, that it is in the most literal sense imaginable, verily and
indeed, the Word of GOD.

And do you,--(for I am still addressing myself to the younger men,)--learn to put away from
your souls that vile indifferentism which is becoming the curse of this shallow and unlearned
age. Be as forgiving as you please of indignities offered to yourselves; but do not be ashamed
to be very jealous for the honour of the LORD of Hosts; and to resent any dishonour offered
to Him, with a fiery indignation utterly unlike anything you could possibly feel for a personal
wrong. Attend ever so little to the circumstance, and you will perceive that every form of
fashionable impiety is one and the same vile thing in the essence of it: still Antichrist,
disguise it how you will. We were reminded last Sunday that the sensualist, by following the
gratification of his own unholy desires, in bold defiance of GOD'S known Law, is in reality
setting himself up in the place of GOD, and becoming a GOD unto himself[411]. The same is true
of the Idolatry of Human Reason; and of Physical Science: as well as of that misinformed Moral
Sense which finds in the Atonement of our LORD nothing but a stone of stumbling and a snare.
It is true of Popish error also;--for what else is this but a setting up of the Human above
the Divine,--(Tradition, the worship of the Blessed Virgin, the casuistry of the Confessional,
and the like,)--and so, once more substituting the creature for the Creator?--What again is
the fashionable intellectual sin of the day, but the self-same detestable offence, under quite
a different disguise? The idea of Law,--(that old idea which is declared to be only now emerging
into supremacy in Science,)--takes the hideous shape of rebellion against its Maker; and pronounces,
now Miracles, now Prophecy, now Inspiration itself, to be a thing impossible; or is content
to insinuate that the disclosures of Revelation are at least untrue. What is this, I say, but
another form of the self-same iniquity,--a setting up of the creature before the Creator who
is blessed for evermore; a substitution of some created thing in the place of GOD!

The true antidote to all such forms of impiety, believe me, is not controversy of any sort;
but the childlike study of the Bible, each one for himself,--not without prayer.--Humble must
we be, as well as assiduous; for the powers of the mind as well as the affections of the heart
should be prostrated before the Bible, or a man will derive little profit from his study of
it. Humble, I repeat, for mysteries, (remember), are revealed unto the meek[412]; and the fear
of the LORD is the beginning of Wisdom[413]; and he that would understand more than the Ancients
must keep GOD'S precepts[414]; and it is the commandments of the LORD which give light unto
the eyes[415].--The dutiful student of the Bible is permitted to see the mist melt away from
many a speculative difficulty; and is many a time reminded of that saying of his LORD,--"Do
ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of GOD[416]?" ...
The humble and attentive reader of the Bible becomes impressed at last with a sense of its
Divinity, analogous I suppose to the conviction of Eleven of the Apostles that the Man they
walked with was none other than the SON of GOD. That similarity of allusion,--that sameness
of imagery,--that oneness of design,--that uniformity of sentiment,--that ever-recurring anticipation
of the Gospel message;--all goes to produce a secret and sure conviction that every writer,
under whatever variety of circumstances, had access to but one Treasury,--drew from but one
and the same Well of living water. Marks of purpose, shewn in the choice or collocation of
single words, often strike an attentive reader; which, singly, might be thought fortuitous;
but which, collectively, can only be accounted for on a very different principle. The beautiful
structure of the Gospels strikes him especially; and he could as soon believe that a song harmonized
for four Angel voices had been the result of accident, as that the Evangelists had achieved
their task without special aid, throughout, from Heaven. A lock of very complicated mechanism,
which four keys of most peculiar structure will open simultaneously,--must have been as evidently
made for them, as they for it.

It is almost treason, in truth, to the Majesty of Heaven to discuss the Bible on the low ground
which I have been hitherto forced to occupy. It is quite monstrous, in the first University
of the most favoured of Christian lands, that a man should be compelled thus to lift up his
voice in defence of the very Inspiration of GOD'S Word. O that Divine narrative, which is for
ever rending aside the veil, and disclosing to us the counsels of the presence-chamber of the
ALMIGHTY!--O those human characters, beset with all the infirmities of our fallen nature,--whose
words and actions yet are shadows of things heavenly and eternal!--O that majestic retinue
of types which, from the very birthday of recorded Time, heralded the approach of the King
of Glory!--O that scarlet thread which runs through all the seemingly tangled web of Scripture,
to terminate only in the cross of CHRIST!--How do the features of the Gospel struggle into
sight through the veil of the Law! How do the holy and humble men of heart ever and anon break
out into speech, as it were, before the time;--as if they felt the burden of silence too great
to be endured!... Whence is it that we dare to handle the pages of GOD'S Book as if they were
a common thing,--doubting, questioning, cavilling, disbelieving, denying? Why choose for ourselves
the soldiers' part, who buffeted, reviled, smote, spat upon Him?... O my friends, far, far
be all this from you and from me! Never imagine, because this day we have thus spoken, that
such discussions are congenial to us; or that we deem them the proper theme for addresses from
the pulpit; although the coincidence of this day's Collect seems, for once, to lend a kind
of sanction to our present endeavours. Look through the whole range of patristic homilies,
and you will not find one of the kind, with which, unhappily, our ears are grown so familiar
in this place,--ingenious attempts to evacuate Holy Writ of its fulness, on the one hand;--or
apologies of some sort for its Divinity and Inspiration, on the other. You will take, if you
are wise, far, far higher ground, in your private study of its pages; remembering that "the
most generous faith is invariably the truest;"--nor ever stoop so low as we have been this
day doing. Waste not thy precious time in cavil about the structure of the casket which contains
thy treasure; but unlock it once with the Key of Faith, and make thyself rich indeed.--Already,--(as
we were last week reminded),--already the Judge standeth at the door; and assuredly, thou and
I, (to whom GOD hath entrusted so much!) shall have to render a very strict account of the
use we have made of the Bible,--when we shall stand face to face with its undoubted Author.
The season of the year reminds us, as with a trumpet, of that tremendous hour when the veil
will be withdrawn from our eyes,--and the office of Faith will be ended,--and we shall be confronted
with One who hath "a vesture dipped in blood, and whose Name is called THE WORD OF GOD."

SUPPLEMENT TO SERMON IV

There is yet another view of the nature and office of Inspiration,--another 'Theory' as it
would perhaps aspire to be called,--which limits the extent of the Divine help and guidance
which the writers, confessedly inspired, may be supposed to have enjoyed. According to this
view, it is admitted that Inspiration was, from first to last, a continuous influence; exerted
equally throughout: but then, it has been suggested that perhaps its office was not to protect
a Writer against a certain class of errors. The office of the Bible, (it is argued,) is to
make men wise unto Salvation. It does not follow that Inspiration, because it guided a sacred
writer so long as he wrote of Christian Doctrine, so as to make what he wrote unerringly true,
should have protected him against slips of memory; preserved him from inaccuracies of statement;
from inconclusive reasonings; from incorrect quotations; from mistaken inferences; from scientific
errors.--This is what is said: and because this is a view of the question which is observed
to recommend itself occasionally to candid, and even to reverential minds, it seems to deserve
distinct and careful consideration.

But I must preface all I have to reply by remarking that "a Book cannot [properly] be said
to be inspired, or to carry with it the authority of being GOD'S Word, if only portions come
from Him, and there exists no plain and infallible sign to indicate which those portions are;
and if the same Writer may give us in one verse of the Bible a revelation from the MOST HIGH,
and in the next verse a blunder of his own. How can we be certain, that the very texts, upon
which we rest our doctrines and hopes, are not the uninspired portions? What can be the meaning
or nature of an Inspiration to teach Truth, which does not guarantee its recipient from error?"--So
far a living sceptical writer.

1. Now, the first thing which strikes one in this theory, is its extreme vagueness. We hardly
know what we have to consider; for nothing is definitely stated. Neither are we informed how
many of the phenomena of Inspiration, this view is intended to explain. Again, does the theory
apply equally to the Old Testament and to the New? If it does apply equally to the Old Testament,
(and I can see no possible reason why it should not,) then, I apprehend this theory will be
found practically to run up into, and to identify itself with, that last described[418]. For
a guidance which has failed to guide, has been no guidance at all; and since whole chapters
of the Old Testament will occur to every one's memory which may be thought to have no connexion
whatever with 'Christian Doctrine,'--to conduce wondrous little to the 'making men wise unto
Salvation,'--it will follow that Inspiration is, according to this theory, in effect, of the
nature already described,--namely, a quality which can never be predicated of any passage of
Scripture with entire certainty. The larger part of the Old Testament in fact, by this theory,
is exhibited in the light of a common book; having no pretension to be regarded as part of
the Inspired Canon.

But if this theory simply shirks the question of the Old Testament, then, those who are inclined
to accept it, are bound to explain why there should be one theory of Inspiration applicable
to the Old Testament, and another for the New:--in which difficulty, I must candidly profess
that I am not able to render any assistance at all. It is clearly not allowable to overlook
the intimate connexion which subsists between the two great divisions of Holy Scripture; the
habitual references of the Writers of the New Testament to the writers of the Old,--Moses,
David, Isaiah, and the rest;--or rather, to the utterance of the HOLY GHOST, speaking by the
mouth of those writers. Whatever may have been the Inspiration of the Authors of the New Testament
must be assumed to have been that of the Authors of the Old Testament also.

2. But further,--(to confine our remarks to the Scriptures of the New Testament; which, it
is manifest, the view under consideration specially contemplates;)--however plausible in the
abstract a theory may sound, which would account for a Chronological difficulty,--the insertion
of what seems to be a wrong name,--a quotation made with singular license,--an unscientific
statement,--the apparent inconsistency of two or more accounts of one and the same transaction,
in respect of lesser details,--a (supposed) inconclusive remark, or specimen of reasoning which
seems to be fallacious;--on the supposition that it is not the office of Inspiration to enlighten
the understanding on points like these, or to preserve the pen from error;--however plausible,
I say, this theory, abstractedly considered, may appear;--it will be found that it will not
bear the searching test of a practical application.

It would indeed be a great advantage to the cause of Truth, and a great help to individual
minds, as well as wonderfully promote the arriving at a sound conclusion in this perilous department
of speculative Divinity,--if, instead of putting up with a vague theory, (like the present,)
regardless of its logical bearings and necessary issues;--men would compel themselves to apply
their view to the actual phenomena of Holy Scripture: to carry it out to its legitimate consequences,
and steadily to contemplate the result. I venture to predict that the theory which we are now
considering, when submitted to such a test, would be found not only inconvenient, but absolutely
untenable. The inconsistency and absurdity which results from it, can, I think, easily be made
to appear.

For if any one who is disposed to regard it with favour,--instead of idly, (as is the way with
nine-tenths of mankind,) repeating the formula in terms more or less vague and indefinite;
and straightway wincing, falling back on generalities, and in a word shirking the point, the
instant it is proposed to bring the question to a definite issue;--if a favourer of the present
theory I say, instead of so acting, would take up a copy of the New Testament, and proceed,
with a pen in his hand, to apply the theory, by running his pen through the places, (and they
must be capable of individual specification!), which he suspects of being external to the influence
of Inspiration;--or, if you please, which he thinks have been penned without that Divine help
which makes what is written infallible;--I venture to predict that such an one will speedily
admit that his erasures are either so very few, or so very many, as to be fatal to the theory
of which they are the expression.

If they be confined to "the fifteenth year of Tiberius[419]; to the names of the second Cainan[420],
Cyrenius[421], Abiathar[422], 'Jeremy the prophet[423];'" to "the sixth hour[424]," and so
on;--no great inconvenience truly will result. But the instant you go a step further, the difficulty
begins. Many of the quotations from the Old Testament may be made to correspond with the Hebrew,
doubtless, without sensible inconvenience: but there are others which refuse the process. However,
let it be supposed that all such indications of imperfect memory, or misapprehension of the
sense of the Hebrew Scriptures, have been removed; and here and there, that an irrelevant clause
in the reasoning has been lopped off, or an unscientific remark expunged.--After all this has
been done, I venture to say that the result will be the reverse of satisfactory, even to the
theorist himself. He will infallibly exclaim secretly,--I seem to have gained wondrous little
by this corrective process. Was it worth while, in order to achieve this, to tamper with the
Divine Oracles? The great body of Scripture remains after all, in all its strangeness, all
its perplexing individuality. Meanwhile, piety and wisdom modestly suggest,--Is it reasonable
to think that Evangelists and Apostles should have stumbled, like children, before dates, and
names, and quotations from their own Scriptures? Surely if this be all that can be objected
against the Bible, the very slenderness of the charge becomes its sufficient refutation!...
The erasures are so few, in fact, that they refute the theory.

But if, on the other hand, the pen be freely used, then the result will be fatal to the theory,
because it will be fatal to the record. If an 'Essayist and Reviewer' were to reduce the Gospels
to consistency, according to his view of consistency, the Gospels would scarcely be recognizable.
If he were to reject from St. Paul's writings every instance of what he thinks fanciful exposition,
illogical reasoning, inexact quotation, and mistaken inference; the result would be altogether
unmanageable. For any one who attends to the matter will perceive that such things run into
the very staple of the Apostle's argument; and therefore cannot be detached without destroying
the whole. The householder's reason for not removing the tares, ("lest while ye gather up the
tares ye root up also the wheat with them[425],") applies exactly. If St. Paul's exposition
of Melchizedek be fanciful and untrustworthy, then does the proof of the superiority of our
SAVIOUR'S Priesthood over that of Aaron, fall to the ground. If his handling of the story of
Sarah and Hagar be an uninspired allegory, then does his argumentation respecting the rejection
of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles disappear. If the furniture of the Temple, and
the provisions of the Jewish ritual, were not dictated by the SPIRIT of GOD[426], then will
the Epistle wherein it is found be reduced to proportions which make it meaningless. If Deuteronomy
xxv. 4 has no reference to the Christian Ministry, then the entire context (in two of St. Paul's
Epistles) must go at once[427].... It is useless to multiply such instances. Any one familiar
with the writings of St. Paul will know the truth of what has been offered; and will admit
that the erasures required by the theory before us will become so numerous as to prove,--(to
a devout mind at least, or indeed to any one of sense and candour,)--that the theory is altogether
untenable.

It cannot escape observation, therefore, that however plausible this view of Inspiration may
sound, as long as some few petty historical, chronological, and scientific inaccuracies are
all that have to be accounted for;--the theory (unhappily) proves worthless when it comes to
be practically applied; inasmuch as in the writings of St. Paul, for example, there is little
or nothing of the kind just specified, to be condoned. Erroneous dates, unscientific statements,
wrong names, and the like, form no part of the staple of the New Testament. Such instances
may be counted on one's fingers; and are to be sufficiently explained to render any special
theory of Inspiration in order to meet them, quite a gratuitous exercise of ingenuity.

3. On the other hand, if a wider class of phenomena is to be dealt with by this theory, the
reader is requested to observe that we involve ourselves in a gross contradiction; for we forsake
the very principle on which it pretends to be built. The theory set out by reminding us that
"the office of the Bible is to make men wise unto Salvation,"--not to teach physical Science,
nor to deal with facts in chronology and the like: and the plea was allowed. But the theory
which was devised to account for one class of phenomena is now most unwarrantably applied to
account for another. We have travelled into a widely different subject-matter,--namely, Divinity
proper! Let it therefore be respectfully asked,--If the Inspiration which the Apostles enjoyed
did not preserve them against unsound inferences in respect of Holy Scripture; and illogical,
inconclusive argumentation in things Divine;--pray, of what use was it? We have not been reviewing
a set of Geological mistakes on the part of the great Apostle. To Physical Science, he has
scarcely so much as a single allusion. He deals with Christian Doctrine; with Divinity, properly
so called; and with that only. Pray, was not Inspiration a sufficient guide to him, there?

4. It is high time also to remind the reader that although the office of the Bible, confessedly,
is "to make men wise unto Salvation," it does not by any means follow that that is its only
office. In other words, we have no right to assume that we know all the possible ends for which
the Bible was designed; and to lay it down, as if it were an ascertained fact, that it was
not designed to enlighten men in matters of Chronology, History, and the like; seeing, on the
one hand, that all the evidence we are able to adduce in support of such an opinion, does not
establish so much as a faint presumption that any part of Scripture is uninspired; and seeing
that, on the other, as a plain matter of fact, historical details constitute so large a part
of the contents of the Bible; and that the sacred volume is the sole depository of the History
and Chronology of the World for by far the largest portion of the interval since that World's
Creation.

5. In passing, it may also be reasonably declared, that it is to take a very derogatory view
of the result of the HOLY SPIRIT's influence, to suppose that imperfections and inaccuracies
can freely abound,--nay, can exist at all,--in a Revelation which the same HOLY SPIRIT is believed
to have inspired. They ought surely to be demonstrated to exist, before we are called upon
to listen to the apologies which have been invented to account for their existence!

6. Let me also advert to a dilemma which seems hardly ever to obtain from a certain class of
critics the attention it deserves. If a writing be not inspired, it is of no absolute authority.
If a part of a writing be not inspired, that part is of no absolute authority. If a single
word in the text of Holy Scripture be even uncertain,--(as, for example, whether we are to
read ΟΣ or ΘΕΟΣ in 1 Tim. iii. 16,)--that word becomes without absolute authority. We cannot
venture to adduce it in proof of anything. Without therefore, in the remotest degree, desiring
to discourage the application of a true theory of Inspiration to the phenomena of Holy Scripture,
through fear of the necessary consequences,--may we not call attention to the manifest awkwardness
of a theory which no one knows how to apply, and about the application of which no two men
will ever be agreed?--the issue of the discussion being, in every case, neither more nor less
than this,--whether the portion of Scripture under consideration is Human, and therefore of
no absolute authority; or Divine, and therefore infallible!

7. A far more important consideration remains to be offered, and with this I shall conclude.
Although, when St. Paul appears to reason inconclusively, some of us do not hesitate to refer
the Apostle's (supposed) imperfect logic to his personal infirmity,--yet, common piety revolts
against the proposal to apply the same solution to the same phenomenon when it is observed
to occur in the Discourses of our Blessed LORD Himself. It seems to have been providentially
ordained, however, that the discourses of CHRIST Himself should supply examples of every one
of those difficulties which it is thought lawful to account for,--when an Apostle or an Evangelist
is the speaker,--on the hypothesis of partial, imperfect, or suspended Inspiration. Now, since
I, at least, shall not be permitted to be either vague or general, I proceed to subjoin the
proof of what has been thus advanced:--

=1=. The well-known difficulty about "the days of Abiathar," is found in one of our LORD'S
discourses[428]. Here then is a case of what, if an Evangelist or an Apostle had been the author
of the statement, would have been called an historical inaccuracy.

=2=. However unworthy of scientific attention the Mosaic account of the descent of Mankind
from a single pair may be deemed,--the universality of 'the Noachian Deluge,'--the destruction
of the Cities of the plain,--the fate of Lot's wife,--Jonah in the fish's belly,--and so forth;--to
all these (supposed) unscientific statements our Blessed LORD commits Himself unequivocally[429].

=3=. When the Holy One inferred the Resurrection of the Dead from the words spoken to Moses
"in the bush[430];"--when He proved that CHRIST is not the son of David, because "David in
spirit calls Him 'LORD[431];'"--and when He shewed from a clause in the 6th verse of the lxxxiind
Psalm, ("I said ye are gods,") that it was not unlawful for Himself to claim the title of SON
of GOD[432];--I humbly think that the argumentation is of such a nature as would not produce
conviction in captious minds cast in a modern mould[433]. I desire not to dwell longer upon
this subject; and only hope in what I have ventured to say concerning some of the recorded
sayings of Him to whose creative Power and Goodness I am indebted for the exercise of my own
reason,--I have not written amiss. But the point of what I am urging is, that I defy any one
to bring a charge of faulty logic against passages in St. Paul's Epistles which might not,
with the same show of reason, be brought against certain of our LORD's recorded sayings.

=4=. When the Chief Priests and Scribes remonstrated with our LORD because of the children
crying in the Temple; and asked Him,--"Hearest Thou what these say?" ... Now, this quotation
from the viiith Psalm is what an 'Essayist or Reviewer' would have pronounced irrelevant.

=5=. It seems clear from Gen. ii. 24, that Adam was the author of the words, "Therefore shall
a man leave his father and his mother," &c. And yet, our LORD (in St. Matth. xix. 4, 5,) as
unmistakeably seems to make GOD the Speaker. An Evangelist or an Apostle would be thought here
to have made a slip of memory.

=6=. In St. John viii. 47, the following words occur. This passage (as already pointed out[435],)
has been adduced by one who now occupies an Archiepiscopal throne, as containing a logical fallacy.

Many more examples might be adduced: but these will suffice. It is plain
that when the like phenomena are observed in the writings of Apostles
and Evangelists, we need not, in order to account for them, have
recourse to any theory of partial or imperfect Inspiration; since
nothing of the kind is supposed necessary when they occur in the
Discourses of our LORD.--As much as I care to offer on the subject of
Inspired Reasoning will be found in the course of the Sixth of these
Sermons, where the Doctrine of 'Accommodation' is considered. Till this be
     determined, it must in all reason be supposed, (not indeed that
     they have, for this is taking for granted that they are inspired;
     but) that they may have, some farther meaning than what the
     compilers saw or understood.

[397] "With the idea of a Prophet," (says Gesenius in his Hebrew Lexicon, on the noun,) "there
was this necessarily attached; that he spoke not his own words, but those which he had divinely
received; (see Philo, t. iv. p. 116, ed. Pfeifferi,--προφήτης γὰρ ἴδιον μὲν οὐδὲν ἀποφθέγγεται,
ἀλλότρια δὲ πάντα ὑπηχοῦντος ἑτέρου); and that he was the messenger of GOD, and the declarer
of His will. ... Elsewhere, (speaking of the Hebrew verb, 'to prophesy,') Gesenius has the
following remarkable statement:--"The passive forms, Niphal and Hithpael, are used in this
verb; from the Divine Prophets having been supposed to be moved rather by another's powers
than their own." (Just as if the Oracles of GOD were not express on the subject! viz. "No prophecy
ever came by the will of Man; but, [because they were] borne along (φερόμενοι) by the HOLY
GHOST, spake those holy men of GOD."--2 St. Pet. i. 21.)

Προφήτης, in fact, means 'an interpreter' rather than 'a prophet,' (for which, in our popular
sense, the Greek is rather μάντις:) hence the use of the words προφήτης, προφητεύω, προφητεία
in the New Testament, e.g. 1 Thess. v. 20. 1 Cor. xi. 4: xii. 10. Rom. xii. 6, (where see Wordsworth.)
See also 1 Cor. xiv. 1, 3, 4, 5, &c.: in all which places, the προφήτης was what we should
rather now call a preacher. But then, the expounding of GOD'S Word is the special function
of the preacher's office from which he takes this name.--The reader is referred to Blomfield's

[399] Analogy, P. II. c. vii.--The same thing has been more fully expressed in a volume of
Sermons which deserves to be far better known than it is:--"I suppose that if there is one
portion of the Old Testament which a discriminator would set aside as less needing to be reckoned
inspired than other parts, it is the Historical; the books which are strictly narrative. Now
it may seem to have been providentially ordered, in the purpose of meeting this view, that
these books are made to bear on them most peculiarly the stamp and the claim of Inspiration.
For they do not profess to be so much the account of what Man did, as what GOD did in ruling
men, and guiding human events. They are a history of a providential course of events, and,
(which is the point,) as seen from the providential point of view. They are a history written
not on Earth, but above the skies. Events are spoken of therefore in this view. A man's obduracy
is recorded thus,--'GOD hardened his heart.' A king numbers his people; it is recorded as a
thing suggested in the spiritual world. In fact, the historic volume of the Old Testament is
a history of the secret springs of things; it is a narrative of things which none but GOD ALMIGHTY
could know; not Man's Word therefore at all, but GOD'S."--Sermons, by the Rev. C. P. Eden,

[433] 'Essayists and Reviewers' would reply, that in the first instance, the supposed inference

person intended in Psalm cx. is CHRIST; and (2) it does not follow, because David calls him
"lord," that the person so spoken of is not his "son:"--that in the third instance, 'gods'
is used in Psalm lxxxii. of earthly rulers; whereas, when our SAVIOUR called Himself "the SON
of GOD," He claimed to be "of one substance with the FATHER,--GOD of GOD."

ST. MATTHEW iv. 4.

It is impossible to preserve exact method in Sermons like these, uncertain in number, and delivered
at irregular intervals. It shall only be stated that, having already spoken at considerable
length, of the INSPIRATION of Holy Scripture;--not, one part more, one part less, but every
part equally inspired throughout; not general, (whatever the exact notion may be of a book
generally inspired,) but particular, by which I mean that every word is none other than the
utterance of the Holy Ghost[437]: having, moreover, explained the reasonableness,--(the logical
necessity, as it seems,)--of giving such an account of the Bible;--I propose to-day to proceed
to the subject of INTERPRETATION. Really, it has become the fashion of a School of unbelief
which has lately emerged into infamous notoriety, to deal with both these questions in so insolent
a style of dogmatism, that the preacher is compelled to halt in limine; and to explain that
he begs that no offence may be taken at the account which he has just given of the Bible; for
that really he means no more than Bp. Pearson meant when he said that "the Scripture phrase"
is "the Language of the HOLY GHOST[438]:"--that he desires to say no other thing than what
He said, by whose Spirit, (as St. Peter declares[439],) the prophets prophesied;--the preacher,
I say, wishes to explain that he desires to mean no other thing than our LORD JESUS CHRIST
Himself meant, when He spoke of "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD."

I. INTERPRETATION, then, in the largest sense of the term, I take to denote the discovery of
the method and meaning of Holy Scripture.--I exclude those critical labours which merely aim
at establishing a correct text.--I exclude also the learning which merely investigates the
grammatical force of single words. True, that even to translate is often to interpret; but
this results only from the imperfection of language,--which can seldom represent the words
of one idiom by the words of another, without at the same time parting with the associations
which belong to the old words, and importing those which are inseparable from the new.--Moreover,
except occasionally, it is presumed that the lore of the Antiquary, Geographer, and so forth,
does not aspire to the dignity of Interpretation.--To be brief,--whatever simply puts us on
a level with ordinary hearers of ancient days; does no more than inform us what custom, locality,
or date is intended by the sacred writer; (things which once were obvious, and which ought
not to be any difficulty now;)--all this, I say, seems external to the province of Interpretation;
the purpose of which is to discover the method and the meaning of Holy Writ. And I find that
every extant specimen of this sacred Science is either (1) what GOD hath Himself revealed;
or (2) what the Church hath with authority delivered; or (3) what individuals have thought
themselves competent to declare.

Of these three authorities concerning the sense of Scripture, it is evident that the last-named
is entitled to least notice. So unimportant indeed is it, as scarcely to be of any weight at
all. What one individual asserts, on his own unsupported authority, another individual may,
with as much or as little authority, deny; and who is to decide?

But the authority indicated in the second place, clearly challenges very different attention.
When, for example, our own Hooker declares, concerning the 5th verse of the iiird chapter of
St. John, that "of all the ancients there is not one to be named that ever did otherwise expound
or allege this place than as implying external Baptism[440]," we perceive at once that such
consent, on the part of men in whose ears the echoes of the Apostolic Age had not yet quite
ceased to vibrate; and who were themselves professors of that Divine Science which takes cognizance
of the subject-matter in hand:--such general consent of Antiquity, I say, on a point of Interpretation,
must evidently be held to be decisive.

"Religio mihi est, eritque, contra torrentem omnium Patrum, Sanctas Scripturas interpretari;
nisi quando me argumenta cogunt evidentissima,--quod nunquam eventurum credo[441]." So spake
one who had read the Fathers with no common care, and who turned his reading to no common account.
"I persuade myself," he says, "that you will learn the modesty of submitting your judgment
to that of the Catholic Doctors, where they are found generally to concur in the interpretation
of a text of Scripture, how absurd soever that interpretation may, at first appearance, seem
to be. For upon a diligent search you will find, that aliquid latet quod non patet,--'there
is a mystery in the bottom:' and that which at first view seemed even ridiculous, will afterwards
appear to be a most certain truth[442]." "No man can oppose Catholic consent, but he will at
last be found to oppose both the Divine Oracles and Sound Reason[443]."

The distinction thus drawn between individual opinion and the collective voice of the Church,
was far better understood anciently than at present. The interpretation of a Council, especially
if oecumenical, was accounted decisive. Even the generally consentient voice of Doctors and
Fathers, as far as it could be ascertained, was held to be of the same authoritative kind.
An interesting illustration occurs. Than Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea, few Fathers of the fourth
century were more learned in Holy Scripture. He, commenting upon "the Captain of the LORD'S
Host," mentioned in the vth chapter of the Book of Joshua, delivers it as his opinion that
it was the same Personage who spoke to Moses 'in the Bush;' viz. the Eternal SON[444]. On which
opinion, a learned man of the same age, in a scholion of singular beauty which has come down
to us, remarks as follows:--"Aye, but the Church, O most holy Eusebius, holds a view on this
subject altogether at variance with thine[445]." He goes on to allege reasons why the ἀρχιστράτηγος
of Joshua must be held to have been not an uncreated, but a created Angel; the Archangel Michael,
in fact. We will not now go into that matter. You are but requested to observe, how profoundly
unimportant the opinion of a very learned individual was held to be, by one in whose ears the
Patristic "torrent" was yet sounding; although Justin Martyr is known to have been of the same
mind with Eusebius.--And thus much for individual views as to the meaning of Holy Scripture;
as contrasted with the decisions of Councils and Fathers. To judge from the signs of the Age,
we have exactly reversed the ancient estimate; and expect that more respect will be shewn to
our own private fancies, than to a general consensus of Divines, ancient and modern. It seems
to have been discovered that the supreme guide of Life is the individual conscience,--"without
appeal--except to himself[446]!"

II. Before descending, however, to the business of Interpretation, there is clearly one preliminary
question to be settled: namely, the principle on which Interpretation is to be conducted. And
this is all that can be discussed to-day. To seek for that principle in the contradictory pages
of solitary theorists, would of course be hopeless, as well as absurd. To elicit it from Patristic
Commentaries, would obviously leave a door open for cavil. The ancient Fathers, (allowing that
they often speak with consentient voice,) singly, were but fallible men,--however famous, as
professors of Theological Science, they may have been. This, however, I venture to assume without
any hesitation whatever,--that if, instead of either of these two ways of ascertaining how
Holy Scripture ought to be handled, we can be so fortunate as to discover from the Inspired
Writers themselves what their method was with respect to the Word of GOD,--in such case, I
say, we shall be in a position of entire certainty[447]. We shall then have full warrant for
disregarding the dicta of modern sciolists on this great subject;--however arrogant their dogmatism,
however confident their unsupported asseverations.

I desire to be very clearly understood. My position is this. All Christian men allow that the
Apostles and Evangelists of our LORD were inspired. If we can but discover what the mind and
method of these several speakers and writers was, with regard to the Interpretation of Holy
Scripture; on what principle, and with what sentiments, they bandied the Book of GOD'S Law;
we shall have discovered the thing of which we are in search. For the Author of a book must
perforce be allowed to be the best judge of the method and intention of that book:--the HOLY
SPIRIT must be allowed to be the best authority as to His own meaning!

Now this method,--(of which, as I will presently remind you, we possess a great many specimens,)--proves
to be very extraordinary. It altogether establishes the fact that the Bible is not to be interpreted
"like any other book." That it could not be so interpreted, might have been confidently anticipated
beforehand, from the very fact of its Divine origin[449]. What I mean,--Since, "by the mouth
of David," the HOLY GHOST is expressly declared by CHRIST and by St. Peter to have "spoken;"
and since the Psalms collectively are described by St. Paul as the utterance of the HOLY GHOST;
since Jeremiah's witness is said to be the witness of the HOLY GHOST; and the HOLY GHOST is
actually said to have spoken by Isaiah; while the Spirit of CHRIST Himself, (St. Peter says,)
dwelt in the Prophets:--in a word, since "holy men of GOD spake as they were moved by the HOLY
GHOST," and the provisions of the Mosaic Law are to the same HOLY GHOST by St. Paul emphatically
ascribed[450];--stubborn facts, you are requested to observe, which Essayists may prudently
suppress but which no Sophistry on earth can either evade or deny:--seeing, I say, that Holy
Scripture is declared by inspired men to be the utterance of the Eternal God, it was to have
been expected beforehand that its texture would bear witness to its Divine origin; and that,
to interpret it "like any other book," would be to forget its extraordinary character. Interpret
Sophocles and Plato, if you will, like any other book, for a very plain reason; but beware
how you apply your purely human notions to the utterance of the Ancient of Days; for that utterance,
enshrined in one particular volume, clearly makes that one volume essentially unlike any other
volume in the world.

You are particularly requested to observe, further,--that singular pains have been taken to
mystify this entire subject. It has been a favourite device to multiply difficulties,--real
or imaginary,--and so, to create a miserable sense of the dangers which fairly hem the subject
in,--in order to render more palatable a desperate escape from them all. Thus, we are told
of the risks to which Grammatical nicety, and Rhetorical accommodation expose us; and again,
the snares into which the Logical method may betray. Metaphysical aid, we are assured, mystifies;
and even Learning, (would to Heaven we had a little more of it!) obscures the sense[451]. Might
we just take the liberty of suggesting that the study of the exploded works of German unbelievers,
(of which Germany herself, thank GOD! is beginning to be ashamed,) on the part of men of very
moderate intellectual powers, however wise in their own conceit; and with no previous Theological
knowledge to guide them,--is another yet more fruitful avenue to error?... Next, we are threatened
with the manifold inconveniences which would ensue from the discovery that there is more than
one sense in Holy Scripture,--(that one sense being assumed to be, not the sense intended by
its Divine Author, but the sense which the first hearers may be supposed to have put upon it[452].)
"If words may have more than one meaning," (it is not very logically argued,) "they may have
any meaning[453]." We are told a great deal about "the growth of ideas;" and of human prejudices;
and of "the disturbing influence of Theological terms."--But all this kind of thing, it will
be perceived at once, is altogether foreign to the matter in hand. Ought Scripture to be interpreted
like any other book,--or not? That is the real question! Has Scripture only one meaning, or
more? That is the point in dispute! Above all, What is the true principle of Scripture Interpretation?
That is the only thing we have to discover!

Now, as for how the principles of Divine Interpretation are to be discovered, it is undeniable
that there can be no surer way than by discovering what is the method of the HOLY GHOST; by
inquiring, what is the method of our SAVIOUR CHRIST, and of His Evangelists, and of His Apostles?

1. Surely it is needless to remind an audience like the present, what that method is! Turn
the first page of St. Matthew's Gospel, and weigh well the three famous cases of Interpretation
which there encounter you[454]:--namely, the assurance that Hosea's words, "Out of Egypt have
I called my son[455];"--that Jeremiah's declaration concerning the tears of Rachel[456];--and
that the many prophetic utterances concerning "the Branch[457];"--found fulfilment, each, in
CHRIST. The first,--when, at Jehovah's bidding, He was carried up out of Egypt into Palestine;
the second,--when the bereaved mothers of Bethlehem wept for their murdered offspring; the
third,--when CHRIST, being bred up in Nazareth, was called a "Nazarene,"--the root of which,
etymologically, denotes "a branch."--But look further, and your surprise will increase at discovering
how extraordinary the Divine method is. When our Saviour cast out evil spirits and healed the
sick, St. Matthew declares that He fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah, "Himself took our infirmities
and bare our sicknesses[458];" the language of the prophet in fact being, "Surely He hath borne
our griefs and carried our sorrows[459];" which, as far as the words go, is rather a different
thing.

2. But it is St. Paul who affords us the largest induction of instances. When he would establish
the right of the Clergy to have due provision made for them, he finds his warrant in a most
unexpected place of Scripture. "Say I these things as a man? or saith not the Law the same
also? (μὴ τῶν βοῶν μέλει τῷ Θεῷ;) or saith He it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
doubt, this is written[461]." I remind you of the entire passage, because it is so very express.--Elsewhere,
St. Paul adduces a few verses from the viiith Psalm, the primary and more obvious meaning of
which appears to assert nothing more than the supremacy of Man's present nature over the inferior
races of animals; ("all sheep and oxen, yea and all the beasts of the field[462].") The application
of it, in a prophetic sense, to the supreme dominion of our Redeemer over all created beings
in Heaven and Earth, is certainly not one which would naturally suggest itself to us; yet is
it for this purpose, and this only, that St. Paul adduces it; and as confirmatory of the universal
sovereignty of CHRIST, the place in question is three times quoted by the same Apostle[463].--Elsewhere,
when he would warn persons who have been partakers of both Sacraments, of the danger of final
rejection, he cites the example of the Fathers of Israel in the Wilderness. Moreover, he declares
that they "did all eat the same spiritual meat;" ... Our SAVIOUR'S emphatic application to
Himself (in the vith of St. John) of the Manna, "the bread which came down from Heaven,"--none
can forget[466].

3. But St. Paul further largely interprets the ordinances of the Mosaic Law.

Now these samples of Inspired Interpretation would be abundantly sufficient for our present
purpose. But before I proceed to make any use of them, it is right to draw attention to a phenomenon,
even more extraordinary.

4. It is found then, that besides vindicating for the Scriptures of the Old Testament this
unsuspected depth and fulness of prophetic and typical meaning, the very Narrative itself teems
to overflowing with mysterious purpose. You have but to weigh well what the HOLY SPIRIT hath
delivered concerning Abraham and Melchizedek, Hagar and Sarah,--to perceive that the texture
of the Historical Narrative itself is of supernatural fabric. All are familiar with what I
allude to; but I must remind you of it, in detail. The Apostle is bent on shewing the superiority
of our SAVIOUR'S Priesthood to that of Aaron. How does he proceed? He lays his finger, unhesitatingly,
on a verse in the cxth Psalm, ("Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek;")--declares
with authority that it is CHRIST whom the prophet there alludes to,--or rather, whom GOD apostrophizes,--(for
that is what St. Paul actually says; προσαγορευθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ[474]: although David undeniably
wrote the Psalm;)--and proceeds, without more ado, to draw out minutely the characteristics
of our SAVIOUR'S Priesthood, from the very brief narrative contained in the xivth Chapter of
Genesis. Do but hear him!

The compound name "Melchi-zedek," being interpreted, denotes "King of Righteousness:" while
"King of Salem" denotes "King of Peace." These titles, (it is implied,) are emphatically appropriate
to CHRIST our King; to Him who "is our Righteousness," and the very "Prince of Peace." It happens
that nothing is said in Genesis about the parentage of Melchizedek, nor about the family from
which he sprang: not a word as to when he was born, or when he died. From this silence of Scripture,
St. Paul collects the typical adumbration of One who, as very GOD, was without human parentage,--had
no earthly lineage;--"was before all things," GOD from all eternity,--having indeed "neither
beginning of days nor end of life."--Did not Abraham give to Melchizedek a tithe of the spoils?
Consider then, (St. Paul says,) how great an one Melchizedek must have been! Nay, consider
that the descendants of Levi are commanded to take tithe of their brethren, although all are
sprung from Abraham alike; but here is one, altogether of a different family, taking tithes
of Abraham,--aye and blessing Abraham too;--(δεδεκάτωκε, εὐλόγηκε, "hath tithed," "hath blessed,"--the
effect of the act remaining for ever in CHRIST typified by Melchizedek.)--This mysterious King
of Salem and Priest of the Most High GOD not only tithes but blesses Abraham, who had received
from ALMIGHTY GOD the promises, which included all blessedness, earthly and heavenly. Now,
this implies Melchizedek's superiority,--for, of course, the less is blessed of the greater.--Men
who receive tithe here below are mortal; but the very silence of Scripture respecting Melchizedek's
death, symbolically teaches that HE whom Melchizedek typified, yet liveth.--And indeed, (so
to speak,) the tribe of Levi who take tithes, paid tithes to Melchizedek in the person of their
great progenitor; because Levi was as yet in the loins of his father Abraham when Melchizedek
met him[475].... I do not ask your pardon for thus leading you in detail over one unusually
minute specimen of Divine Interpretation. I know well that there are many persons to whom the
Divine method is highly distasteful; and who think their own method of Interpretation infinitely
better. But, unfortunately for those persons, the question in hand is not a question of taste,
but a dry matter of fact. We have to discover what is the Divine method of Interpretation,
and no other thing. Its improbability and its inconvenience,--its difficulty, and its strangeness,--its
seeming inconclusiveness, (apart from the authority on which it rests,) and its certain uniqueness,
(notwithstanding the many injunctions we have met with that we must interpret the Bible like
any other book[476],)--all these considerations are all together irrelevant, and beside the
question. St. Paul himself admits that the Discourse now before us is πολὺς καὶ δυσερμήνευτος,--long
and of difficult interpretation[477].--Some will perhaps be found to inquire how it happens
that while so many remote points of analogy are adduced, so obviously typical a circumstance
as Melchizedek's bringing forth "bread and wine[478]" obtains no notice from the Apostle? I
answer,--For the same reason that Isaac is nowhere spoken of, nowhere so much as hinted at,
in the Bible, as being a type of CHRIST. A blind man may see it. It requires no Revelation
from Heaven to teach such things as that! But the typical foreshadowing of the superiority
of our SAVIOUR'S Priesthood over that of Aaron, in the story of Melchizedek, would infallibly
have escaped mankind altogether, unless it had been thus specially revealed.

Some there may be so utterly wanting in Theological instinct, or so depraved of taste; so utterly
unused to the study of GOD'S Word, or so unobservant of the characteristic method of it,--as
to imagine that there is something trifling in the specimens of Interpretation before us. I
am only concerned to maintain that they are Divine. You may think what you please about them.
They are the teaching of the HOLY GHOST. Nay, if unfortunately any persons here present should
think themselves wiser than GOD, I would request them to observe that, singularly enough, GOD
has connected with this very exposition a short address to themselves. It runs as follows:--"Concerning
Melchizedek, we have to deliver a long and difficult interpretation; difficult, however, only
because ye have become dull of hearing[479]." (The fault, you observe, is yours. Whereas GOD
made your spiritual senses sharp and quick, you have blunted their edge, and are become stupid
and obtuse. It follows:)--"For when, by reason of the length of time that ye have professed
Christianity, ye ought to be Teachers," (pray mark that!)--"ye have need that some one should
teach you the first Principles of the Oracles of GOD; and ye have become such as have need
of milk, and not of solid food. For every one that useth milk, is without experience in the
Word of Righteousness; for he is an infant. But solid food (στερεὰ τροφή) is for them that
are of full age[480]." Where you are requested to observe that a specimen of Interpretation
you think trifling, the HOLY GHOST calls "solid food;" and yourselves, who in your own conceit
represent the World's Manhood[481], He calls νηπίους,--"babes." ... This discrepancy of opinion
strikes me as rather curious.

5. The time would fail, were we to enter as particularly into the Divine Interpretation elsewhere
given of another story, apparently as little fraught with mystery as any in the Bible. Who
would ever have imagined that the brief narrative of Hagar's dismissal from the house of Abraham
at Sarah's instance, was the ἀλληγορία of so Divine a thing as St. Paul declares;--the two
Mothers setting forth the two Covenants, (one, bearing children unto bondage,--the other, the
free Mother of us all: Sinai symbolized by that, the heavenly Jerusalem by this:) and even
Ishmael's mockery not being without mysterious meaning?--Such however is the Divine Interpretation.--Elsewhere,
when St. Paul desires to contrast the method of the Gospel with the method of the Law,--(this,
glorious; that, with the same glorious features concealed;)--and also to illustrate the present
unbelief of the Jewish nation;--the Apostle finds a prophetic emblem of their blindness in
the veiled countenance of their great Lawgiver, as described in the xxxivth chapter of Exodus.
The mystical intention of that veil, (he says,) was to symbolize the nation's inability to
look steadfastly to the end of the dispensation, and to recognize MESSIAH. Nay, to this hour,
while they read their Scriptures, that veil (he says) is upon their hearts. And yet, even as
Moses, when he returned to GOD, is related to have taken off the veil from his face, so (St.
Paul says) will it fare with the Jews, when they convert and turn themselves to CHRIST. The
veil will be withdrawn[482].--Now, I gather from all this, and many a hint of the like kind,--that
the whole of Scripture is of the same marvellous texture, the Old Testament and the New, alike,--whether
we have the eyes to see it or not.

6. But I cannot dismiss the typical character of the Scripture narrative, until I have reminded
you of one striking intimation of it which you might easily overlook. The same thing is repeated
elsewhere[485]: but the most express declaration is that of our LORD Himself to the Jews:--"Had
ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me; for he wrote of Me[486]," Moses therefore wrote
concerning CHRIST. CHRIST Himself says so. But where? Shew me the places in the Pentateuch
which prove that CHRIST was "to suffer these things" and then to "enter into glory?" You cannot
do it; unless indeed in Isaac's Sacrifice you are content to find the adumbration of the scene
on Calvary. You cannot do it; unless in Joseph's betrayal for twenty pieces of silver, (the
deed of another Judas!) and his letting down into the pit without water, you recognize the
image of the death of One by the blood of whose Covenant the prisoners of hope were set free[487].
You cannot do it; unless in the same Joseph's exaltation to the supreme power of Egypt, (when
they "cried before him, Bow the knee!") you behold MESSIAH'S session at the Right Hand of GOD.
You cannot do it; unless you notice how "Joseph, who was ordained to save his Brethren from
death, who would have slain him, did represent the SON of GOD, who was slain by us and yet
dying saved us[488]." You cannot do it; unless in the Paschal Lamb, and the wave-sheaf, you
discern things Heavenly, and of eternal moment. You cannot do it; unless you remember "that
as, in order to consecrate the Harvest by offering to GOD the first-fruits of it, a sheaf was
lifted up and waved; as well as a Lamb offered on that day by the priest to GOD; so MESSIAH,
that immaculate Lamb which was to die, that Priest which dying was to offer up Himself to GOD,
was upon the same day lifted up and raised from the dead; or rather shook and lifted up, and
presented Himself to GOD, and so was accepted for us all; that so our dust might be sanctified,
our corruption hallowed, our mortality consecrated to eternity." Many who hear me will perceive
that I have been quoting from Bp. Pearson; and will be constrained to admit that Isaac and
Joseph,--the wave-sheaf and the Paschal Lamb,--may well be types of CHRIST; and that, thus
lightly touched, there can be little objection to tracing in such histories and provisions
of the Law, the main outlines of the Life and Death and Resurrection of our REDEEMER. But remember,
we have handled wondrous little of the patriarchal History and of the Law; and that little,
wondrous cursorily; more, as it seems to me, in the manner of children in a Sunday-school,
than as Divines in the first University of Europe!... Now, St. Paul entertained his audience
"from morning until evening." Had he nothing to say about Paradise, think you, and the mysterious
parallel between the first and second Adam? nothing to say about the Ark of Noah, and the waters
of the Flood? What of the history of the patriarch Jacob, and of Joseph "at the second time
made known to his brethren?" What of Moses, and the miracles of the Exode? What of the many
minute provisions, (all of them, no doubt, significant!) of the Mosaic Law? What of Esau's
posterity and Balaam's prophecies,--the Cloud and the Flame,--the Manna and the Quails,--the
riven Rock and Jordan driven back?...

I have already said enough to feel at liberty to gather out of it all, the two chief propositions
concerning Holy Scripture, which it is my business this morning to establish.

I would not be misunderstood by this audience, nor do I fear that I shall be. I am not denying
(GOD forbid!) the literal sense of Scripture. Rather am I, above all, contending for it. We
may never play tricks with the letter. Those Six Days of Creation, depend upon it, were six
days: and the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge, and the Serpent, were the very things
they are called,--and no other things. So of every other part of the Bible. The Temptation
of our LORD was as matter of fact a transaction as one of His walks by the sea of Galilee.
In what form the Tempter came to Him, hath not been revealed. After what fashion the Prince
of the power of the air contrived the dazzling panorama "in a moment of time[490]," I do not
pretend to understand. The literal sense of what has been revealed, is, for all that, to be
depended on. All is sincere History: nothing is ever allegory,--nothing may ever be evacuated
or explained away! We have our LORD'S own word for it. The speech in Paradise, and what happened
at the time of the Flood; the fate of Lot's wife, and what befel the cities of the plain; the
conduct of David (when he ate the shew-bread), and the visit to Solomon of the Queen of Sheba;
the history of the widow of Sarepta, and of Naaman the Syrian:--all these stories of the Old
Testament are by our LORD Himself appealed to as veritable History[491].

But I am proving that Scripture itself, literally understood, compels us to believe that under
the letter of Scripture, (which of course is to be interpreted literally,) there lies a deeper
and sometimes a far less obvious meaning; occasionally a meaning so improbable, (as men account
improbability,) that, but for the finger of GOD pointing it out, we could never by possibility
have discerned it; so extraordinary, that when it is shewn us, it needs an effort of the heart
and of the mind to embrace it fully.

Cases of literal Interpretation are indeed of constant occurrence in Scripture; but the principle
on which they depend is obvious, and common to all writings alike. I do not doubt, for a moment,
that the history of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, (which we heard read this morning,) is a bonâ
fide narrative,--truer and more authentic in details, than is to be found in any other book
of History.--Neither do I doubt that the obvious teaching, (the moral Interpretation as it
may be called,) of that incident, is the proper one: viz. that even for the most fiery of fleshly
trials, GOD'S grace is sufficient:--that Joseph's safety lay in refusing even to be with her,
joined to his holy fear of sinning against GOD:--that lust is ever cruel, and will hunt for
the precious life[492]:--finally, that the way of purity, though it may lead at first to sorrow,
will infallibly conduct to blessedness at the last. Considerations like these, which are obvious
and easy, are also unquestionably true; and especially precious, (who ever doubted it?) as
helps to personal holiness.--But still, there may underlie this narrative, for aught I see
to the contrary, a mystical signification. Potiphar's wife may, (as the best and wisest of
ancient and modern Divines have thought,) symbolize the Power of Darkness; and Joseph, our
Divine LORD. The garment Joseph left in the woman's hand, may represent that fleshly garment
of which the true Joseph divested Himself,--(ἀπεκδυσάμενος as St. Paul speaks in a very remarkable
place,)--the mortal body which Satan apprehended (his sole triumph!) and by which he was ensnared,
when a greater than Joseph gat Him out from an adulterous world[493]. Joseph in the prison,
and CHRIST in the grave: Joseph exalted, and CHRIST Ascended: Joseph at last feeding the families
of the World, and CHRIST becoming the Bread of Life to all:--let it not occasion offence, Brethren,
if I confess that, for aught I see to the contrary, some such hidden teaching as this, may
underlie the plain historical narrative; and in no way interfere with a literal interpretation.

III. From the two foregoing negative positions, however, (which almost need an apology, such
obvious truisms are they,) I eagerly pass on to something better and higher.

1. And first, I boldly declare that the clue to all that has been advanced concerning the marvellous
method of Holy Writ is supplied by the single consideration that the Bible is the Word of GOD,--that
Holy Scripture, from the Alpha to the Omega of it, is the language of the HOLY GHOST. Incomprehensible
and unmanageable on any other hypothesis,--all the disclosures of inspired Interpretation,
by the hearty reception of this one revealed truth, are rendered perfectly intelligible and
clear. The HOLY SPIRIT may surely be assumed competent to interpret what the HOLY SPIRIT has
already delivered! His disclosures therefore are beyond the reach of censure; however marvellous
they may happen to be. But they are all a hopeless riddle to those who have blinded their eyes
and hardened their hearts.

Thus, to advert for a moment to the prophetic character (as it may be called) of the historical
parts of Scripture,--What is it which moves secret unbelief, and prompts a reference to the
human devices of Allegory and Accommodation[494]? It is the profound conviction that no merely
human narrative could be handled as St. Paul handles Genesis, except by indulging in rhetorical
license, and giving to Fancy a very free rein. But disabuse your mind of this lurking suspicion,
so derogatory to the honour of Him by whose Spirit the Bible is inspired,--cease to suspect
that the narrative of Scripture is a merely human narrative,--and how different becomes the
problem! Why should the HOLY GHOST have spoken less by the mouth of Moses, than by the mouth
of David and Isaiah, Jeremiah and the rest of the prophets? But if He speaks in Genesis, then
are the words of Genesis His;--and every word of the narrative "proceedeth" (as our LORD phrases
it,) "out of the mouth of GOD." Now, I will not pause to remark on the complicated fallacy
involved in this. For (1), Why should a hearer's first impression of a speaker's meaning be
assumed to be that speaker's meaning[497]? And (2), Why may not Prophets and Evangelists have
intended secondary meanings[498]? But I do not dwell on this, for it does not touch the point.
Let us hear the voice of one who adorned this place many years before the present controversy
arose, and who has exactly anticipated the question now at issue. "Observe how this matter
really is," says Bp. Butler. "If one knew a person to be the sole Author of a book; and were
certainly assured, or satisfied to any degree, that one knew the whole of what he intended
in it; one should be assured or satisfied to such degree, that one knew the whole meaning of
that book: for the meaning of a book is nothing but the meaning of the Author. But if one knew
a person to have compiled a Book out of memoirs which he received from Another, of vastly superior
knowledge in the subject of it; especially if it were a Book full of great intricacies and
difficulties; it would in no wise follow that one knew the whole meaning of the Book, from
knowing the whole meaning of the compilers: for the original memoirs, (i.e. the Author of them,)
might have, (and there would be no degree of presumption, in many cases, against supposing
Him to have,) some farther meaning than the compiler saw. Butler.

2. Now, if GOD be in effect the Speaker, why need we hesitate to believe that He has so framed
the stories, that they shall be throughout adumbrations of the things which concern our peace[500]?
Let some garment be shewn me of merely human manufacture, and however costly it may prove,
I look for nothing in it beyond the known properties of any other earthly fabric. But give
me the assurance that, on the contrary, it was woven by Divine hands, and fashioned in a Heavenly
loom, and do I not straightway expect to find it a mystery and a marvel of Art? It is even
so with the language of Holy Writ. It is all framed and fashioned after a Diviner model than
men are able to imagine. It is instinct with sublimest meanings. It is penetrated, through
and through, with the Spirit of the Most High GOD. It is of so celestial a texture, that, to
the eye of the soundest Reason, informed by the purest Faith, it reveals, (when the Spirit
of its Divine Author shines upon it,) the glorious outlines of an imperishable Life!

3. The strong root of bitterness out of which springs unbelief in this supernatural character
of the historical parts of the Bible, is an unworthy notion of GOD'S Power. Because human histories
are perforce barren and lifeless, it is assumed that the Book of GOD'S Law must be a dead thing
also. And then, the conceit of self-relying Reason glides in, (like a serpent,) and remonstrates
as follows:--"Yea, can GOD have sanctioned a method of such subtlety and pliability as will
make His own Scriptures mean anything[501]? Is it not rather, an exploded fashion, which the
age has outgrown,--that fashion of supposing that there is sometimes a double sense in Prophecy,
and that the Gospel is symbolized in the Law? Were then the worthies of the Old Testament puppets
in GOD'S Hands, acting parts?--now, typifying remote personages; now, exhibiting future transactions;
now, symbolizing national events? Is it credible? Not so! Accept one of two alternatives, and
never dream of a third. Believe either that the Evangelists, the Apostles, our SAVIOUR CHRIST
Himself,--partaking of the ignorance of their age, and speaking according to the modes of thought
then prevalent, were mistaken in their interpretations of Holy Scripture; or else, deny boldly
that there are interpretations at all. Assume that they are mere allegory and accommodation!

4. To all of which, we make summary answer:--Passing by thy self-congratulation on the enlightenment
of the age,--of which, except in certain departments of physical Science, we see no evidence;--the
whole of thy argument concerning Holy Scripture amounts to this;--that it would be very distasteful
to thee, to find that it contained any sense beyond that which lies on the surface. Types,
intended by the Author of Scripture to be types: Prophecy with sometimes more than a single
application: historical events foreshadowing remote transactions:--all these thou deniest,
because thou dislikest. Observe, however, that while thou art urging thine own private opinion,
we are dealing with a revealed fact. Thou talkest about a probability, but we are establishing
a proof. "It is written" that Scripture is thus significant, is thus mysterious in its historical
outlines. And thou canst not explain away one syllable, though thou shouldest deny "every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD."

5. Let us, however, examine the question merely by the light of unaided reason.--Consider then!
If GOD made this world the particular kind of world which He is found to have made it, in order
that it might in due time preach to mankind about Himself, and about His providence:--if He
contrived beforehand the germination of seeds, the growth of plants, the analogies of animal
life; all, evidently, in order that they might furnish illustrations of His teaching; and that
so, great Nature's self might prove one vast Parable in His Hands:--why may not the same GOD,
by His Eternal Spirit, have so overruled the utterance of the human agents whom He employed
to write the Bible, that their historical narratives, however little their authors meant or
suspected it, should embody the outline of things heavenly; and, while they convey a true picture
of actual events, should also after a most mysterious fashion, yield, in the Hands of His own
informing Spirit, celestial Doctrine also?

6. For let me remind you,--The very actions of men,--the complicated transactions of our common
lives,--are thus overruled by God's Providence; and, without restraint, are so controlled that
they shall subserve to the ulterior purposes of His will,--after a fashion which altogether
defies analysis. Beyond this inner circle of comprehensible causation,--external to the immediate
sphere of cause and effect which courts our daily scrutiny,--there is an outer circle, which
rounds our lives; and (as I said) overrules all we do; fashioning, by virtue of a supreme fiat
which is altogether beyond our comprehension, all our ends. Why then, I ask, may not the Bible
be, what it purports to be,--the authentic record of transactions which the marvellous skill
of Him who governeth all things in Heaven and Earth did so overrule, that they should become
foreshadowings of chief transactions in the Kingdom of CHRIST? Shall prophecy, in the ordinary
sense of the term, be admitted by all,--and yet a prophetic transaction be deemed impossible
with GOD? If Isaiah may prophesy of one "red in His apparel," after "treading the winepress
alone[504];" may describe Him as "despised and rejected of men;" "a Man of Sorrows and acquainted
with grief;" "wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities;" "brought as a
lamb to the slaughter," and "making intercession for the transgressors;" and at last destined
to find "His grave with the wicked, yet with the rich in His death[505]:"--if this may be in
words described minutely, and move no doubt; shall we close our eyes that we may not see,--or
seeing shall we fail to recognize,--in the person of such an one as David, a divinely-intended
type of MESSIAH? What! when he who was born in Bethlehem, overcomes the Philistine at the end
of forty days, and takes from him the armour wherein he trusted;--when he,--a prophet, priest,
and king,--is persecuted by his enemies, and betrayed by his own familiar friend; when he at
last passes over the brook Kidron and ascends Olivet, sorrowing as he goes;--yea, when he utters
words which our REDEEMER resyllables with His dying breath[506];--wilt thou refuse to discern
in the person of David, the lineaments of David's Son? and sneer at us, who herein have been
better taught than thou; although thou hast no better reason to give for thy unbelief than
that the view of Holy Scripture which the Church Catholic hath held in all ages, seems to thee
a thing impossible?

7. Take once more, if thou wilt, the analogy of Nature; and thence infer what is probable concerning
things Divine. Is it observed that the works of GOD are thus single in their office; or are
they, on the contrary, manifold in their virtues and uses? Than the metal Iron, what substance
more serviceable for every ordinary mechanical purpose of daily life? Yet, ask the physician
which of the metals he could least afford to forego as an instrument of cure: and he will tell
thee that he finds Iron the fullest of healing virtues also. Shall then plants and animals,
yea, and the whole of the Animal Kingdom, be admitted to subserve to manifold, and at first
sight unsuspected uses,--so that the wisest are ready to confess that the function of most
remains to this hour a secret:--and shall we be reluctant to allow that the Word of GOD--"the
Tree of Life," whereof "the leaves are for the healing of the nations,"--may also be thus various
in its purpose; fraught with other teaching besides that which on its very surface meets the
careless eye?

8. To speak without a figure,--It is not of course to be supposed that the inspired writers
knew all the wondrous qualities of the message they delivered, or of the narrative they were
divinely guided to indite. Altogether a distinct question this; although the two have been
sometimes confused together[507]. Nay, Revelation itself comes in to help us here. That "not
unto, themselves, but unto us they did minister,"--thus much, indeed, was revealed to them;
but no more. The rest, to this hour, the very "Angels desire to look into!"

9. But between the words which a man delivers being full of Divine significancy, and himself
knowing the full scope and purport of those words,--there is surely a mighty difference! When
Caiaphas foretold the universal efficacy of CHRIST'S Death, who less than Caiaphas suspected
the far-reaching truth of the words which fell from his unholy lips? He knew nothing about
the triumphs of the Cross; and yet he could prophesy very accurately concerning them. ... It
may safely be assumed that the sacred writers no more knew the force and power of their own
words, than those Priests who lived and moved amid the shadows of the Mosaic Ritual were able
to discern therein, the substance of things eternal in the Heavens. And yet we believe concerning
those ritual types that "they were a concealed prophetic evidence, the force of which was made
apparent by the presence of the Gospel[509]." I am prone to suspect that the burning vehemence
of their own language must many a time have moved the Prophets of old to deepest astonishment;
and that when there broke from them words of more than mortal power,--or images of unearthly
grandeur,--or the outlines of a grief more than human; when they spake of a betrayal for thirty
pieces of silver[510], of blows and spitting[511], and of pierced hands and feet[512]; of parted
garments and lots cast upon a vesture[513];--they must have felt, they must have felt the awfulness
of the message they were commissioned to deliver; and longed, yea yearned unutterably to see
and to hear the things which were reserved to be witnessed in the days of the Son of Man!

10. Enough, however, of all this. In reply to à priori objections, I have been content to argue
the question as if the Bible were a newly-discovered Book without a history; whereas the consentient
writings of all the Fathers and Doctors of every age, in every portion of the Christian Church,
is an overwhelming fact! Rather have I reasoned as if the Bible were a book altogether silent
concerning itself. But the plain truth, as I have fully shewn, is the very reverse. Scripture
is full of interpretations of Scripture;--and the constant method of Scripture in such interpretations,
is spiritual or mystical;--and this witness of Scripture is the strongest proof possible that
the principle involved is correct. Meanwhile, the great underlying truth which I now desire,
more than any other to bring before you, is this:--that it is the HOLY GHOST who, in the New
Testament, interprets what the same HOLY GHOST had delivered in the Old. This, believe me,
is the true key, the only intelligible solution, to all those difficulties respecting places
of the Old Testament, whether interpreted, or only quoted, in the New, which have so exercised
the ingenuity of learned men. We are always to remember, in a word, that the true Author of
either Testament,--the real Author of every part of the Bible, is (not Man, but) GOD!

IV. Such then, (to conclude,) is the Divine method of Interpretation. We are not concerned
now to classify, and sort it out under different heads. To apply, even to a small extent, the
principles we have been labouring to establish, would not only lead us much too far, but would
constrain us to travel out of our proper subject and prescribed province. Our purpose has only
been, to vindicate the profundity, or rather the fulness of Holy Writ[514]; and to shew that
under the obvious and literal meaning of the words, there lies concealed a more recondite,
and a profounder sense: call that sense mystical, or spiritual, or Christian, or what you will.
Unerringly to elicit that hidden sense is the sublime privilege of inspired Writers; and they
do it by allusion, by quotation, by the importation of a short phrase[515], by the adoption
of a single word[516],--to an extent which no one would suspect who had not carefully studied
the subject. How that method of theirs is to be applied by ourselves, it is impossible, I repeat,
for me even to hint at in a single discourse. But this, I will say; and with this I dismiss
the subject;--that Interpretation would be a hopeless task, but for the solemn circumstance
that the whole of the Bible is inspired by one and the self-same Spirit; so that one part may
always be safely compared with any other part of it, you please. Nay, by no other method can
you hope to understand the Bible, than by such a laborious comparison of its several parts.
"Non nisi ex Scripturâ Scripturam potes interpretari." The more you study the Book, the more
you will feel convinced that its many authors all resorted to one and the same Fountain of
Inspiration. They all use the same imagery; they all speak the same language; they all mean
the same thing. St. John the Divine, in the Book of Revelation, shuts up the Canon by reproducing
the combined imagery of all the ancient prophets,--by declaring that the Song of Moses and
of the LAMB is sung by the redeemed in Heaven,--by marvellous words about "the Tree of Life,"
which is "in the midst of the Paradise of GOD." The Inspired writers of either Testament all
draw from the same Treasury, and therefore all say the same things. The Heavenly Jerusalem,
(with her gates of pearl and streets of gold,) is the home of the spirit of each one of them[517];
JESUS CHRIST, and He Crucified, is the abiding theme of them all. And O, how their words do
sometimes teem, and their phrases swell, almost to bursting, with their blessed argument[518]!
You shall be troubled with only one example of what I mean.--Moses having described the interview
between Melchizedek and Abraham, the mighty secret of MESSIAH'S priesthood which therein lay
enshrined was curtained all so close, that neither Angels nor Men could possibly discern it.
Must it then remain a mystery for 2000 years? Not so! Midway between the day of Abraham and
the day of CHRIST,--just midway,--David, speaking by the HOLY GHOST,--(of that, our LORD Himself
assures us[519],)--David, I say, when a thousand years had rolled by, utters the cxth Psalm;
and in the fulness of his prophetic fervour, the great secret bursts unexpectedly into light!
A thousand years had passed since Abraham returned from 'the slaughter of the Kings.' It wanted
yet a thousand years to the date of our SAVIOUR'S Birth. And lo, midway, a voice is heard,
shouting to Him across the gulf of Ages,--"Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek!"

"And let not Reason be alarmed. Her vocation is not gone. Yea rather, I know not if Human Intellect
ever had a loftier problem presented to her than to follow out that deep Analogy which has
been noticed above; and to learn, (if it may be called Reason's learning,) how to deal with
Holy Scripture as Apostles and Evangelists deal with it. Let not Reason be alarmed. She is
only asked to listen, and to discern the nature and laws of Sacred Study. She is asked but
to discern the evidence which there is of her being in a world which she imperfectly understands....
The student of the Bible is advised so to address himself to the study of that Book, so to
deal with its language, as one should deal with THE WORD OF GOD,--the measure of whose import
is in the infinite, not in the finite World.--Surely, by these things the LORD tries the spirits
of us all; tries other men by other means, but tries the intellectual man by the Word of GOD[520],
and watches him as he reads it; hardens the obdurate; blinds the self-blinded; but pours into
the humble mind the riches of His divine Wisdom like showers into a valley; making it soft
with the drops of rain and blessing the increase of it[521]."

V. Friends and brethren, it is not without reluctance that on a Sunday in Lent, when penitential
thoughts should rather occupy us,--and in this place too, where the promotion of practical
piety should rather be our aim,--I have so addressed you. But indeed, I seem to have no choice.
It is idle crying "peace, peace," when there is no peace. If the Inspiration of Holy Scripture
be a deceit, and the Divine meaning of Holy Scripture a superstition,--then, farewell to all
our hopes in Life and in Death; farewell to peace in days of despondency and gloom. Our faith
is gone, and our teaching becomes a hollow heartless thing. Since, under the name of freedom
of discussion, unbounded licentiousness of speculation is openly the fashion of the age, we
are constrained to give a reason for the hope which is in us; and to defend, without compromise
or hesitation, that Bible, which is the great bulwark of the Faith. It shall not be said that
we can condemn, but that we make no answer. It must be seen that we put forth in reply the
ancient Truths; and it will be felt that before the majesty of those ancient Truths, the arts
of the enemy will prove weak and unavailing,--rather, will stand revealed in all their native
deformity. If English Clergymen, coming abroad in the cast-off clothes of German unbelief[522],
and decked out with the exploded sophisms of the last century, are to declare openly that the
faith of our Fathers is already looked upon among ourselves as 'a kind of fossil of the Past,'--then
is it high time that voices should be heard vindicating that ancient method of our Fathers;
and boldly proclaiming that this imputation against the Clergy of England is a disreputable
untruth. The Church of England, (GOD be praised!) hath not left her first love; hath not given
up her ancient method; Christianity is not 'a difficulty to the highest minds.' The Christian
Religion embraces, as much as ever it did, "the thought of men upon the Earth." "All the tendencies
of Knowledge" are not "opposed to it." The Gospel is still immeasurably before the age. Intellect
has not gone,--the loftiest order of well-trained intellects will never go,--the other way[523].
It is, on the contrary, none but a very shallow wit which errs. Had it confined its speculations
to the cloister, or come abroad with sorrow and shame, we should have pitied in silence, and
in silence also have lamented. But when it comes insultingly abroad, and sets up a claim to
intellectual superiority even while it denies the most sacred truths;--then pity gives way
before indignation and disgust. Crown the whole with the iniquity of imputing these views generally
to the more thoughtful of the English Clergy[524],--and we are constrained openly to resent
the grievous wrong. We declare it to be an unfounded calumny; a calumny which, in the name
of the whole Church, I solemnly repel before GOD,--and His Holy Angels,--and you!

Vain, utterly vain,--worthless, utterly worthless,--must any superstructure of intellectual,
moral, or religious training be, which is built up on the doctrine that the Bible is to be
interpreted like any other Book; in other words, that the Bible is a common Book; in other
words, that Inspiration is a fable and a dream. We have no fear whatever that your high instincts,
(with all your faults!),--your English manliness,--will, to any extent be led astray, by sophistry
worthless as that which we have been exposing. But we know you look to your appointed Teachers
from this place, (as well you may,) for advice, and support, and encouragement, in your better
aspirations;--and let me, at least, in plain language, warn you that novelties in Religion
never can be true. "Philosophia," says the great Bishop Pearson speaking of Physical Science;
"Philosophia quotidie progressu: Theologia nisi regressu non crescit[525]." "Ask for the old
paths!" ... The faith, remember, was ἅπαξ,--once for all,--delivered to the Saints. There will
be no new deposit. There can be no new doctrines. There has been no fresh Revelation,--no new
principle of guidance vouchsafed to man. A new method of interpreting Scripture is quite impossible.
And the true method,--the only true method--must be that which was adopted by our SAVIOUR,
by His Evangelists, and by His Apostles: a method which they taught to their first disciples,
and which those early Bishops and Doctors handed on in turn to the generation which came after
them. O let it be our great concern,--yours and mine,--to preserve with undiminished lustre
the whole deposit of Heaven-descended teaching which is the Church's treasure!... Like runners
in a certain ancient race of which we all have read, let it be our pride and joy,--yours and
mine,--to grasp the torch of Truth with a strong unwavering hand; to run joyously with it so
long as the days of this earthly race shall last; and dying, to hand it on to another, who,
with strength renewed like the eagle's, may again,--swiftly, steadily, exultingly,--run with
it, till he fails!... So, when the Judge of quick and dead appeareth,--so let Him find you
occupied,--O young men, (many of you, my friends,) who are already the hope of half the English
Church!

     Ut verum fatear, semper existimavi, allusiones istas, (ad quas
     confugiunt quidam tanquam ad sacrum suæ ignorantiæ asylum,)
     plerumque nihil aliud esse, quam Sacræ Scripturæ abusiones
     manifestas.

     There would be no need to scruple the term, if it were not meant to
     imply that this Accommodation was arbitrary on the part of the
     Evangelist; or that the mind of THE SPIRIT that spoke by the
     Prophet does not most fully include this application.

[437] "It cannot be said that this, [viz. that the Bible is the Word of God,] is always remembered.
It cannot be said that they who write respecting the Bible, even Christian writers who are
looked up to, always appear to have been in that frame of mind while contemplating the statements
of the Sacred Volume, which they, the same men, would have been in if they had been listening
for a voice out of a cloud; a word reaching them which was simply, and in that sense, the Word
of GOD. Yet the Sacred Volume comes to us with no less claims than as conveying such a message;
and on every feature of it, it carries that claim. It professes to be this,--an account of
what went on in the secret council-chamber of the MOST HIGH."--Eden's Sermons, pp. 150-1.

THE DOCTRINE OF ARBITRARY SCRIPTURAL ACCOMMODATION CONSIDERED.

       *       *       *       *       *

ROMANS x. 6-9.

It is quite marvellous in how many different ways different classes of professing Christians
have contrived to nullify the value of their admission that the Bible is inspired. Some would
distinguish the inspiration of the Historical Book from that of those which we call Prophetical.
Others profess to lay their finger on what are the proper subjects of Inspiration, and what
are not. Some are for a general superintending guidance which yet did not effectually guide;
while others represent the sacred Writers as subject, in what they delivered, to the conditions
of knowledge in the age where their lot was cast. The view of Inspiration which Scripture itself
gives us,--namely, that God is therein speaking by human lips[527]; so that 'holy men of GOD'
delivered themselves as they were 'impelled,' 'borne along,' or 'lifted up,' (φερόμενοι) by
the HOLY GHOST[528];--this plain account of the matter, I say, which converts 'all Scripture'
into something 'breathed into by GOD,' (θεόπνευστος,)[529]--men are singularly slow to acknowledge.
The methods which they have devised in order to escape from so plain a revealed Truth, are
'Legion.'

Second to none of the enemies of Holy Writ, practically, are they who deny its depth and fulness.
It is only another, and a more ingenious way, of denying the Inspiration of the Bible, to evacuate
its more mysterious statements. Those who are for eluding the secondary intention of Prophecy,
the obviously mystical teaching of Types, the allegorical character of many a sacred Narrative,--are
no less dangerous enemies of GOD's Word than those who frame unworthy theories in order to
dwarf Inspiration to the standard of their own conceptions of its nature and office. I say,
it is only another way of denying the Inspiration of Scripture, to deny what is sometimes called
its mystical, sometimes its typical, sometimes its allegorical sense.... And thus,--what with
the arbitrary decrees of our own unsupported opinion, or the self-sufficient exercise of our
own supposed discernment;--what with our insolent mistrust; or our shortsighted folly and presumption;
or, lastly, our coldness and deadness of heart,--our slender appetite for Divine things, which
makes us yearn back after Earth, at the very open gate of Heaven;--in one way or other, I repeat,
we contrive to evacuate our own admission that the Bible is an inspired Book: we fasten discredit
on its every page: we become profane men, like Esau: we despise our birthright.

But the most subtle enemy of all remains yet to be noticed. It is he, who,--finding the plain
Word of GOD against him: finding himself refuted in his endeavour to fix one intention only
on the words of the HOLY GHOST, and that intention, the most obvious and literal one; finding
himself refuted even by the express revelation of the same HOLY GHOST, elsewhere delivered;--bends
himself straightway to resist, and explain away, that later revelation of what was the earlier
meaning. It is a marvellous thing but so it is, that the very man who contended so stoutly
a moment ago for the literal meaning of Scripture, now refuses, and denies it. Anything but
that! If he allows that St. Matthew, or St. Paul,--yea, or even our Blessed LORD Himself,--are
to be literally understood; are severally to be taken to mean what they say;--then, Moses and
David,--narrative, law, and psalm,--besides their literal meaning, have, at least sometimes,--and
they may have always,--a mystical meaning also. Under the evident, palpable signification of
the words, there lies concealed something grander, and deeper, and broader; high as Heaven,--deep
as Hell.

And this supposition is so monstrous an one; seems so derogatory to their notions of the mind
of GOD;--it is deemed so improbable a thing, that the words of Him, whose ways are not like
Man's ways, should span the present and the future, at a grasp;--that He whose "thoughts are
very deep," should, with language thereto corresponding, be setting forth CHRIST and His Redemption,
while He tells of Patriarchs and Lawgivers,--Judges and Kings,--priests and prophets of the
LORD:--I say, it is deemed so incredible a thing that Moses should have written concerning
CHRIST, (though our SAVIOUR CHRIST Himself declares that Moses did write concerning Him)[530];
or that the occasional expressions of the Prophets should really contain the far-reaching allusions
which in the New Testament are assigned to them; that the men I speak of,--men of learning
(sometimes), and of piety too,--will condescend to every imaginable artifice in order to escape
the cogency of the Divine statement. St. Paul--was infected with the Hebrew method of interpretation.
(It is of course assumed that this method was essentially erroneous! It is overlooked that
our LORD had recourse to it, as well as St. Paul! It is either forgotten, or denied, that the
HOLY GHOST, speaking by the mouth of St. Paul, acquiesced in every instance of such interpretation
on the part of His chosen vessel!) ... As for St. Matthew, he addressed his Gospel to the Jews,
and therefore reasoned as a Jew would. (St. Matthew's Gospel was not of course intended for
the Christian Church! The blessed Evangelist was also deeply learned,--it is of course reasonable
to suppose,--in the sacred hermeneutics of the Hebrew Schools!) ... The other Sacred Writers,
it is pretended, all wrote according to the prejudices of the age in which they lived.--In
all these cases, it is contended that merely in the way of Accommodation, is the language of
the Old Testament cited in the New. What was said of one thing is transferred to quite another,--to
suit the purpose of the later writer; to illustrate his reasoning, to adorn or to enforce his
statements.... And this brings me to a question of so much importance, that I pause to make
a few remarks upon it. In the present discourse, it shall suffice to remark on the doctrine
of Scriptural ACCOMMODATION; for which it is presumed that the text, (selected not without
reference to the present Sacred Season,) affords ample scope, as well as supplies a fair occasion.

Now, it is not to the term "Accommodation," that we entertain any dislike; but to the notion
which it seems intended to convey; and to the principle which we believe that it actually embodies.
That the HOLY SPIRIT in the New Testament sometimes accommodates to His purpose a quotation
in the Old,--is very often a mere matter of fact. In all those places, for instance, where
St. Paul inverts the clauses of a place cited,--there is a manifest accommodation of Scripture,
in the strictest sense of the word. When two, three, or more texts, widely disconnected in
the Old Testament, are continuously exhibited in the New,--a species of accommodation has,
of course, been employed. The same may be said when a change of construction is discoverable.
Again, there is accommodation, of course, when narrative,--legal enactment,--or prophecy, is
so exhibited that the point of its hidden teaching shall become apparent. Nay, in a certain
sense of the word, there is "accommodation," as often as a prophecy, however plain, is applied
to the historical event which it purports to foretel. The prophecy may be said,--(with no great
propriety indeed, but still, intelligibly,)--to have been accommodated to its fulfilment.--Occasionally,
a general promise is made particular,--as in Hebrews xiii. 6; and perhaps this might be called
an accommodation of the text to the needs of an individual believer. Yet is it plain that in
all these cases 'application' or 'adaptation' would be a better word.

But such ways of adducing Holy Scripture, we suspect, are not by any means what is meant by
'Accommodation;' and they do not certainly correspond with the notion which the term is calculated
to convey. The place in the Old Covenant, seems, (from the term employed,) to have been forced,
against its conscience, as it were, to bear witness in behalf of the New. It has been wrenched
away from its natural bearing and intention; and made to accommodate itself,--and, on the part
of the writer, quite arbitrarily,--to a purpose, with which it has, in reality, no manner of
connexion. This, I say, is the notion which the term "Accommodation" seems to convey.

I am supposing, of course,--(as the opposite school is, of course, supposing,)--not an illustration,--which
obviously any writer, whether ordinary or inspired, has a right to introduce at will; but a
case where the cogency of the argument depends entirely on the place cited. A sudden and unforeseen
requirement arose;--nothing entirely fit and applicable occurred to the memory: but by an arbitrary
handling of the ancient Oracles of GOD,--(altogether illogical and inconclusive indeed, yet
entitled to a certain measure of respectful consideration at our hands, and certainly having
a strong claim on our indulgence,)--the later writer saw that he should be able to substantiate
his position, or to strengthen his argument, or to prove his point. And he did not hesitate
to do so. It is surprising that his hearers or his readers should have accepted his statements,
and admitted his reasoning;--very! But they did. And it is for us, the heirs of the wisdom
of all the ages, to detect the time-honoured fallacy and to expose it.--This, I say, is the
notion which the term "Accommodation" seems calculated to convey; and it is to be feared, does
very often represent.

And the introduction of this principle, as already explained, I cannot but regard as the most
insidious device of all. It admits fully all that we have elsewhere laboured to establish.
It freely grants that Apostles and Evangelists were inspired. But then, it denies that much
of what they deliver in the way of interpretation of Scripture, is to be regarded as real interpretation.
By a taste for Allegory; by Rhetorical license; on any principle, it seems, but one, is the
Divine method to be accounted for; and the plain facts of the case to be obscured, or explained
away.

Now I altogether reject this principle of arbitrary "Accommodation." I hold it to be a mere
dream and delusion. And I reject it on the following grounds:--

1. It is evidently a mere excuse for Human ignorance,--a transparent deceit. Men do not see
how to explain, or account for, the apparent license of the Divine method; and so they have
invented this method of escape.

2. The "theory of Accommodation," (as it is called,) is attended with this fatal inconvenience,--that,
(like certain other expedients which have been invented to get over difficulties in Religion,)
it altogether fails of its object. For even if we should grant, (for argument's sake,) that
some quotations from the Old Testament can be explained on this principle,--so long as there
remain others which defy it altogether, nothing is gained by the proposed expedient. Thus,
so long as attention is directed to certain of the places in St. Paul's writings already referred
to[532], there is certainly no absurdity in adducing them as instances of Rhetorical license.
But how can it be pretended that the text whereby St. Paul establishes, (on two distinct occasions,)
the right of the Christian Ministry to a liberal maintenance,--with what propriety can it be
thought that Deut. xxv. 4 lends itself to such a theory? Those words seem,--and, apart from
Revelation, might without hesitation have been declared,--to have nothing at all to do with
the matter[533]! To talk of the "accommodation" of words so eminently unaccommodating, is unreasonable,
and even absurd.

3. But, allowing the advocates of this theory all they can possibly require, the result of
their endeavours is but to make the Sacred writers ridiculous after all. For it attributes
to them a method, which, if it be a mere exhibition of human fancy, often seems to be but a
species of ingenious trifling,--scarcely entitled to serious attention at our hands. There
is no alternative, in short, between certain of the expositions which we meet with, being Divine,--and
therefore worthy of all acceptation; or Human,--and therefore entitled to no absolute deference
whatever.

4. On the other hand, learned research has hitherto invariably tended to shew that the meaning
claimed for Scripture by an Apostle or Evangelist, does actually exist there. Thus, it has
been admirably demonstrated that the Evangelical meaning attributed by St. Matthew, (in the
first chapters of his Gospel,) to certain places in the ancient Prophetical Scriptures of the
Jewish people, derives nothing but corroboration from the inquiries of Piety and Learning[534]....
It is proposed on the present occasion, without pretending to bring to the question any such
helps as these, to examine the portion of Holy Scripture already under our notice, with a view
to ascertaining what light it will throw on the main question at issue. To this task, I now
address myself.

St. Paul's words, from the 6th to the 9th verse (inclusive) of the xth chapter of his Epistle
to the Romans, present probably, as fair an example as could be desired of what is sometimes
called "Accommodation." To say the truth, I know not an instance of what, in any uninspired
writing, I should have been myself more inclined to stigmatize as such. The Apostle begins
an affectionate remonstrance with his countrymen by declaring that they "did not understand
the Righteousness of GOD;" (that is, the Divine method whereby GOD wills that we shall be made
righteous, by faith in CHRIST;) but desired to set up (στῆσαι) a righteousness of their own,
on the worthless foundation of their own Works[535]. "For," (he proceeds; with plain reference
to what "the Righteousness of GOD" is;)--"For CHRIST is the end" (aim, or object,) "of the
Law[536] to every one who hath faith" in CHRIST. St. Paul straightway proceeds, (as his manner
is,) to establish this latter proposition. How does he do it? "For," (he begins again,)--"Moses
describes the nature of the righteousness which proceeds from the Law, when he declares [in
Leviticus xviii.

Here then is a quotation from the xxxth chapter of the Book of Deuteronomy,--a quotation introduced
in the way of argument, in support of a proposition: the remarkable circumstance being, that
St. Paul adduces the words of Moses with extraordinary license. For first, he omits as many
of the Prophet's words as make little for his purpose, while he introduces a very remarkable
alteration in some of the words which he retains: amounting to a substitution of one sentence
for another. And next, there is one single word, which he expands into an important phrase;
and that merely to suit his own argument. But the strangest thing of all is the interpretation
which he delivers of words, which as we have just seen, are partly his own,--partly, the words
of Moses: by which interpretation, the most strikingly Christian character is fastened upon
sayings pronounced by the ancient Lawgiver in the land of Moab, to the Jewish people.--We do
further, for our own part, most freely admit, that the place,--as it stands in the Old Testament,--neither
at first, nor at second sight, seems to have any such meaning as the Apostle assigns to it.
I will remind you of the words in Deuteronomy, by reading the entire passage:--"This commandment
which I command thee this day, ... is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not
in Heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? ... Now,
I say, one of ourselves might read this passage in the Book of Deuteronomy over a hundred times,
and never suspect that Moses, when he so wrote, was writing concerning faith in CHRIST: and
yet we have the sure testimony of the HOLY SPIRIT to the fact that he was.--The inquiry, "Who
shall ascend into Heaven?", signifies, we are told, "Who shall ascend,--to bring down CHRIST
from above?"--And just so, the other clause, "Who shall descend into the deep?", is declared
to be an incomplete expression: the full phrase being,--"Who shall descend,--to bring up CHRIST[538]
from the dead." ... Now we never desire to see a non-natural sense fastened on the Inspired
Word. With Hooker, we "hold it for a most infallible rule in expositions of sacred Scripture,
that, where a literal construction will stand, the furthest from the letter is commonly the
worst." We contend therefore that whereas we have here the explicit assurance that Moses wrote
of none other than CHRIST,--though his words do not bear upon them any evidence of the fact,--it
is a mere trifling with holy things, to call the fact in question.

Here, however, we shall be reminded that the great Apostle,--though professing to quote,--confessedly
argues in part from his own language, which is not the language of Moses. Moses says,--"Who
shall go over the sea for us?" (τίς διαπεράσει ἡμῖν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θάλασσης;) And since the
version of the LXX is what the Author of the Epistle to the Romans follows in this place, it
is reasonable to expect that he would adhere to that version, or at least to the sense of that
version, in the exhibition of so important a clause as the present. Whereas, instead of "Who
shall go over the sea," we find St. Paul writing,--"Who shall go down into the deep?" (Τίς
καταβήσεται εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον;)--language evidently highly suggestive of the mysterious transaction
to which the same St. Paul says it contains a reference[539]; but certainly not the language
of Moses. And we shall be reminded that this is not merely phraseology rescued from vagueness,
and made definite; but it is the actual substitution of one thought for another. This is what
will be said; and if it be followed up by the assertion that here, therefore, we have a clear
example of Scriptural Accommodation, it might seem, at first sight, impossible to deny the fact.

For our own parts, we are inclined to meet the present difficulty, and every similar one, in
quite another spirit; and dispose of the objection, somewhat in the following way. The same
GOD who gave us the Scriptures of the Old Testament, gave us the New Testament also. The Bible
is one. He who inspired the Law, inspired the Gospel. The HOLY GHOST pleads with us in both
alike.--Surely, therefore, He who spake of old time by the Prophets, may be allowed, when,
in the last days, He speaks by the Apostles of CHRIST,--to explain His earlier meaning, if
He will. Surely, He may tell the Israel of GOD,--if He pleases,--what He meant by the language
He held of old time to Israel after the flesh! Yea, and if it seemeth good to Him to call in
the wealth of His ancient treasury, in order to recoin it that He may the more enrich us thereby:--if
it pleases Him to take His ancient speeches back again into His mouth, in order that He may
syllable them anew,--making them sweeter than honey to our lips, yea, sweeter than honey and
the honeycomb;--what is Man that he should reply against GOD? What should be our posture, at
witnessing such a spectacle, but one of Adoration? What, our becoming language, but praise?

It is easy to anticipate the answer that will be made to all this. We shall be told that we
are, in some sort, begging the question. The Bible is an Inspired Book, indeed: but what is
Inspiration?--Moses wrote the Book called "Deuteronomy:" St. Paul wrote the Epistle to the
Romans. And St. Paul,--quoting a passage out of the older record,--has substituted a sentiment
of his own for a sentiment contained in the writings of Moses. He does the same thing in other
places; and elsewhere, as here, he proceeds to reason upon the data he has so obtained. This,
it will be said, is the phenomenon which we have to deal with.

But, we reply, it is manifest that he who so argues,--with all his apparent good sense, and
fairness,--is entirely committed to a theory concerning Inspiration; and that a very unworthy
one. The Bible comes to us as an Inspired Book; claiming to be the very Word of GOD. The Holy
Church throughout all the World, doth acknowledge it to be so. Surely, therefore, it is for
us to study its contents by the light of this previous fact.--But quite contrary is the method
of our opponents. They treat the Bible as if it were an ordinary Book. They submit its contents
to the same irreverent handling as they would the productions of a merely human intellect.
They not only reason about its claims from its contents,--but they would even pronounce upon
its claims, from the same evidence. They dare to sit in judgment upon it. Hence their lax notions
on the subject of Inspiration. They first run riot among statements which are too hard for
them; and when they have perplexed themselves with these, till the field is strewed with doubts,
and the limits of unbelief and mistrust have become extended on every side,--Inspiration, like
an ill-defined boundary-line on a map, is suffered faintly to hem in, and enclose the utmost
verge of the unhappy domain.--Whereas, we maintain that a belief in the Bible, as an Inspired
Book, should, at the outset, prescribe a limit to human speculations.

Let this belief encircle us exactly, and entirely; and define, at once, the area within which
all our reasonings must be taught to marshal themselves, and to find their full development.
In brief, our opponents meet our remonstrance by another; but, as we contend, an unreasonable
one;--at least, as proceeding from men who, no less than ourselves, allow freely the Inspiration
of Scripture. We say,--The Bible is the word of GOD. Fill your heart with this conviction,
and then humbly address yourself to the study of its pages.--It is argued on the other side,--The
pages of the Bible are full of perplexing statements. They evolve strange phenomena, interminably.
Convince yourself of this; and then make up your mind, if you can, about the Inspiration of
the Bible[540].... I shall have occasion, by and by, to explain more in detail the spirit in
which the Divine Logic,--Inspired reasoning as it may be called,--is to be approached. For
the moment, I am content to waive the question; and to be St. Paul's apologist, almost as if
I had met with his words in an uninspired book.

Solemnly protesting, then, that the ground we have just occupied is the only true ground on
which to take our stand; but withdrawing from it because we do not fear the appeal to unassisted
Reason, even in matters of Faith,--so that the proper limits and conditions of inquiry be but
observed;--we proceed to inquire whether,--apart from Revelation,--there be not good ground
for believing that the words of the ancient Hebrew Lawgiver and Prophet contain and mean the
very thing which the Christian Apostle says they do.--We change our language at this stage
of the inquiry. We no longer assert, (as before we did,) that the HOLY GHOST speaking by the
mouth of Moses, must have meant, what the same HOLY GHOST, speaking by the mouth of St. Paul,
declares that He did mean. We are willing to study the sacred text solely by the light which
grave criticism and patient learning have thrown upon it.--Our inquiry now, is this;--Although
the words in Deuteronomy, read over attentively by ourselves, suggest no such Christian meaning
as we find affixed to them in the Epistle to the Romans,--is there no reason, traditional or
otherwise, for supposing that they do envelope that meaning; yea, so teem and swell with it,
that the germ of the flower may be actually detected in the yet unopened bud?... I proceed
to this inquiry.

1. And first, it is obvious, to any one reading the xxixth and xxxth chapters of the last Book
of Moses, that they contain another Covenant, beside that of Horeb. Not to stand too stiffly
thereupon, however[542], let it be at least freely allowed that even if we choose to regard
this chapter and the next as a renewal only of the Covenant made in Horeb, it is a distinct
renewal;--both in respect of time and of place. Of time,--for whereas the Covenant of Sinai
belongs to the first of the forty years of wandering, the Covenant of Moab belongs to the last.
Of place,--for whereas the other was made at the furthest limit of the people's wanderings,
this belongs to their nearest approach to Canaan.--And I confidently ask, After such an announcement,
and at a moment like that,--the forty years of typical wandering ended, and the earthly type
of the heavenly inheritance full in view, Jordan alone intercepting the vision of their Rest;--shall
we wonder, if here and there a ray of coming glory shall be found to flash through the language
of the dying patriarch? if some traces shall be discernible, even in the language of Moses,
of the dayspring of the Gospel of CHRIST?

2. We find that it contains not a few sayings in support of such a presumption. And what was
the intention of this solemn standing before the LORD? Even--"that thou shouldest enter into
Covenant with the LORD thy GOD, and enter into His oath, which the LORD thy GOD maketh with
thee this day."--The purport of the Covenant thus to be made, was, that GOD might establish
Israel that day for a people unto Himself, and that He might be unto them a GOD,--(an expression
elsewhere appropriated by the Great Apostle to the Christian Church[543],)--as He had ... sworn
unto their fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. So that we have here the renewal of
the Evangelical Covenant made with Abraham, and renewed to Isaac and Jacob,--which is clearly
distinguished in Scripture from the Legal Covenant, made with their children 430 years after;
and which is declared ineffectual to disannul the earlier one, confirmed before by GOD, and
pointing entirely to CHRIST[544]. That earlier Evangelical Covenant then, it was, which was
renewed in the land of Moab;--in the course of renewing which, the words of the text occur.

3. It was the same Covenant, therefore, which is made with ourselves; "for the promise is unto"
us, and to our "children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our GOD shall
call[546]:" "not according to the Covenant which GOD made with the Fathers of Israel in the
day that He took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of Egypt[547]."

Yet more remarkably perhaps is this established by the language of the ensuing chapter: for
GOD therein promises that Circumcision of the heart whereby men should be enabled to love the
LORD their GOD with all their heart and with all their soul. Now this seems clearly to intimate
not legal but Evangelical obedience,--the result of the free outpouring of the HOLY SPIRIT
of GOD; of which, in the Law, (properly so called,) we find no promise whatever. Here then
we discover another anticipation of something which belongs to the times of the Gospel.

And this Evangelical complexion is to be recognized in the entire contents of the xxixth and
xxxth chapters. They contain no single mention of ceremonial rites or observances,--of which
the Law is, for the most part, full. But free obedience and perfect love are inculcated as
the condition of blessedness: while hearty repentance is made the sole condition of forgiveness
of sin.

In connexion with this, I may call your attention to a curious coincidence,--if indeed it be
not something more. On the sincere repentance of the people, it is promised "that then the
LORD thy GOD will turn thy captivity;" which the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases,--"His WORD
will receive with delight thy repentance:" while the Septuagint even more remarkably renders
the words--"will heal thy sins;" that is,--"will be thy JESUS." Moses proceeds,--"and gather
thee from all the nations whither the LORD thy GOD hath called thee."

4. Nor is it, finally, a little remarkable that, by the general consent of the Hebrew Doctors,
this xxxth chapter has ever been held to have reference to the times of MESSIAH. The restoration
spoken, is referred by them to the restoration to be effected by CHRIST: while the promises
it contains are connected with those prophetic intimations which clearly point to the days
of the Gospel[549]. So much, then, for the evidence, apart from Revelation, which the general
complexion of the place in Deuteronomy affords to the reasonableness of the meaning affixed
to it by the voice of the later Scriptures. Before we proceed to examine a little in detail
the words of the text, we may be surely allowed to remind ourselves of the Testimony which
St. Paul bears to the Evangelical character of what is here delivered. He asserts, in the most
direct and emphatic manner, that it is the Righteousness which is by Faith which here speaks[550].
He is contrasting the spirit of the Law, with that of the Gospel. He is setting the requirements
of the one against those of the other. To exhibit the former,--he quotes from Leviticus. To
enable us to judge of the latter,--he quotes this very place in Deuteronomy. Having shewn the
justification under the Law,--which is by entire fulfilment of every enjoined work;--the Apostle
describes the Righteousness of the Gospel,--which is by Faith in CHRIST. And he discovers its
voice in the present chapter: nay, he calls our attention to its language; and, lest the intention
of it should escape us, he proceeds to supply us, not only with an interpretation of it, but
with a paraphrase as well.

Now, that all this denotes something close at hand and easy,--in place of something supposed
to be remote and difficult,--is obvious. The whole of the earlier part of it, St. Paul affirms
to be tantamount to the following injunction,--"Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into
Heaven, to bring CHRIST down; or who descend into the abyss, to bring CHRIST up from the dead."
Concerning which words of caution, we have to remark that there seems to have been no intention
whatever on the part of the Apostle, to warn his readers against requiring a renewed Revelation
of CHRIST in the flesh, or a second Resurrection of the Eternal SON from the dead. He is illustrating
the nature of Legal and Evangelical Righteousness, by the language of the Jewish Law. With
characteristic fire and earnestness, glancing, as usual, at every side of the question before
him,--having, a little way back, explained himself, without explanation, when he inserted that
remarkable parenthetical clause, τέλος γὰρ νόμου ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ[552],--"for CHRIST is the object of
the Law;"--in order now to shew how thoroughly this is the case,--how full the Law is of Him,
in whom alone it finds its perfect scope, end, and completion,--he explains that the very phrase
"Who shall ascend up into Heaven?" pointed to nothing less than the Incarnation of CHRIST:
that, "Who shall go over the Sea?" contained a wondrous far-sighted allusion,--(not the less
real because unsuspected,)--even to the Resurrection of our LORD from death.

Moses then here warns the ancient people of GOD against an evil heart of unbelief. "Say not
in thy heart, Who shall ascend up into Heaven?" for such words on the part of Man would imply
disbelief in the doctrine that the SON of GOD should hereafter take upon Him human flesh.

We shall perhaps be asked, whether it is credible that Moses can have had any conception that
such a meaning as St. Paul here ascribes to his words, did really underlie them? To which we
answer, first, that it is by no means incredible[556]. And next, that whether Moses knew the
full meaning of the language he was commissioned to deliver, or not,--seems, (as already explained[557],)
to be an entirely separate question: the only question before us, being, whether his language
contained that meaning, or not.... To what extent the Prophets,--who, (we know,) studied their
own prophecies[558],--were ever permitted to fathom their depth, is a mere matter of speculation[559];
delightful indeed, but in the present case quite irrelevant. In the meantime, we know for certain
that Moses prophesied of CHRIST[560].

And next, if it be said that really this is only a proverbial expression,--a Hebrew phrase
to denote something passing difficult, and hard of attainment:--(as when, in the Book of Proverbs,
it is asked,--"Who hath ascended up into Heaven, or who hath descended[561]?")--we answer,
we see no ground whatever for supposing that in the place just quoted, it is a proverb, and
no more,--although from its use in the Talmud, the expression would certainly appear to have
become, at last, proverbial[562]. If a proverb, however, it seems to have been a sacred one;
nor can any place be appealed to where it occurs, nearly of the antiquity of this, in the writings
of Moses. To pretend therefore to explain away a certain mode of expression, in the place where
it first stands on record,--and where it is declared to have a deep and mysterious meaning,--simply
because, subsequently, it was (to all appearance) used without any such pregnancy of signification,--is,
manifestly illogical.

Nay, there is good ground for presuming, that the very place last quoted, contains a reference
to the Eternal SON: for Agur proceeds to ask,--"What is His Name, and what is His Son's Name,
if thou canst tell[563]?" ... But the reference is far more obvious when the same expressions
occur in the Book of Baruch. "Who hath gone up into Heaven, and taken her, and brought her
down from the clouds? Who hath gone over the sea, and found her[564]?" For Wisdom is there
spoken of; and Wisdom, as we remember, is one of the names of CHRIST,--the name by which He
is discoursed of, in the Book of Proverbs.

The uninspired evidence which completes the connexion of this place of Deuteronomy with the
second Person in the Blessed Trinity, is the traditional interpretation assigned to it by the
Hebrew Commentators. The Targum of Jerusalem expounds the latter clause as follows:--"Neither
is the Law beyond the Great Sea, that thou shouldest say, O that we had one like Jonas the
prophet that might go down to the bottom of the Great Sea, and bring it to us." So that the
very Jewish Doctors themselves here become our instructors; and teach us that a greater than
Jonas must be here,--even while they guide our eyes to that especial type of our SAVIOUR CHRIST
in His Descent into Hell, and Rising again from the dead.

You will of course notice the facility with which the Jews themselves, interpreting their own
Scriptures, have here exchanged the notions of going "over the sea,"--("beyond the sea," as
it is in the Hebrew,)--and "going down to the bottom" of the sea. St. Paul seems, in this place,
to have "accommodated" the words of Moses: but we cannot fail to perceive that the Hebrew text
must cry aloud for such supposed "accommodation;" yea, cry aloud, even in the uncircumcised
ears of the Jewish people; that their own Commentators, as if divinely guided by the good hand
of GOD, should bear their own independent witness to the correctness of the Apostolic interpretation.

Nor may I fail to call your attention to the term employed by St. Paul to denote the Sea:--a
term, surely divinely chosen. He had just before, (in the 6th and 7th verses,) employed the
Version of the LXX: he was about to use it again in the 8th verse: but in this, (the 7th,)
he departs from it. Instead of,--Τίς διαπέρασει ἡμῖν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης; he writes,--Τίς
καταβήσεται εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον. The term ἄβυσσος,--which is applicable to the deep places of the
Earth, and to the depth of the Sea, with equal propriety;--(being a more indifferent term even
than our own expression "the deep");--affords a memorable example of the fulness and pregnancy
of language on inspired lips. Adhering to the letter of the text he quotes, the Apostle, by
changing the word expressive of that literal sense, embraces the whole spiritual breadth and
fulness of the passage:--reminding us of Him, by the blood of whose covenant were sent forth
the prisoners of hope out of the pit wherein is no water[566],--even before he names Him; our
SAVIOUR CHRIST!

I must also remind you, that there are many expressions used by our LORD, or used concerning
Him by His Apostles, which help to shew, that, to have come down from Heaven,--and to have
been brought up from the deep of the Earth again,--may be regarded as the mysterious summary
of the SAVIOUR'S Mission[567].--"No man hath ascended up to Heaven," (saith our LORD,) "but
He that came down from Heaven[568]." "I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven....
Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before[569]?"
In another place,--"I came forth from the FATHER and am come into the World: again I leave
the World, and go to the FATHER[570]."--But the most remarkable place remains: "Now, that He
ascended, what is it but that He also descended first into the lowest parts of the Earth? He
that descended, is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens[571]." I say, this
brief summary,--given by CHRIST Himself, or by those who had seen Him,--of the mystery of His
manifestation in the flesh,--throws light on the language of the Hebrew lawgiver. ... Such
is the form which the exhortation now assumes. More darkly, of old time,--(as was fitting,)--was
the same thing spoken: and, because reference was then made to an event not yet accomplished,
the impatience of Unbelief is there repressed,--rather than the ardour of Faith stimulated.
"Say not in thy heart who shall ascend into Heaven? or, who shall go down into the deep place?"
... But shall we deal so faithlessly with the Divine Oracles of the Old Testament, as to deny
them the deeper meaning assigned to them in the New, because they speak darkly? Let us, from
a review of all that has been humbly offered,--let us at least admit that there is good independent
ground for believing that when Moses spake of ascending into Heaven,--it was with reference
to the future coming of CHRIST:--when he made mention of descending into the Deep,--the Resurrection
of the SAVIOUR of the World was, in reality, the thing he spake of.--Let us allow that here,
at least, there is nothing in the language of the New Testament, which, when studied by the
light of unassisted Reason, does not appear to have been fully included, contemplated, intended
by the language of the Old:--that the accommodation has not been arbitrary;--say rather, that
here at least there has been no accommodation at all!

But I am impatient to leave this low rationalistic ground, and take my stand again, on the
vantage ground of Faith. The position, I trust, has been established, that even in the case
of words which seem least promising,--least likely to enfold the deeply mysterious meaning
claimed for them by an Apostle,--the result of patient inquiry and research is to shew that
such a meaning really does exist there, to the fullest extent. We have discovered, from mere
grounds of Reason, apart from Revelation, that what St. Paul has cited in this place from Deuteronomy,
may very well contain all that he says it contains. But, were nothing of the kind discoverable;--were
it a most hopeless endeavour to reconcile the meaning evolved by the inspired Apostle, with
the text he professes to interpret,--the claims of the sacred exegesis would remain wholly
unimpaired. We should still say that this, because it is an inspired Commentary, is entitled
to our fullest acceptance. We have, anyhow, the HOLY SPIRIT interpreting Himself. He surely
must be the best judge of His own Divine meaning. He does but enrich the Treasury of Truth,
even by His apparent departures from the original Hebrew verity. Shall not the HOLY GHOST,
the Comforter, be allowed to speak comfort to His people in whatever way seemeth best to Himself?
Is it not lawful for Him to do what He will with His own? Is thine eye evil, because He is
very good?

Yes, it cannot be too emphatically insisted on, that the success which may attend investigations
of this nature, is not to be admitted for a moment as the measure of the soundness of the principle
on which they proceed. The reasoning whereby Newton shewed that the diamond is a combustible
substance would have been no whit invalidated had the diamond resisted to this hour every chemical
attempt to reduce it to carbon. We do not,--(what need to say?)--we do not discourage the endeavour
to enucleate the deep Christian significancy of passages for which Inspired writers claim such
sublime meaning. Rather do we think that Human Reason could not find a worthier field for the
employment of her powers[572], than this. But we are strenuous to insist that the full and
sufficient, and only irrefragable proof that a mighty Christian meaning does actually underlie
the unpromising utterance of one of GOD'S ancient Saints, is,--that an Inspired Writer declares
it to exist there.

There is no accommodation therefore, when an inspired writer adduces Scripture. Human language
will sometimes require to be "accommodated:" Divine language, never! May not the HOLY SPIRIT
lay His finger on whatever parts of His ancient utterance He sees fit? may He not invert clauses,
and (in order to bring out His meaning better) even alter words? If He tells thee that the
prophetic allusion of Isaiah to "our griefs" and "our sorrows" comprehends "our infirmities"
and "our sicknesses" in its span[573],--is it for thee to discredit His assertion? If He is
pleased to intimate that the providential arrangement whereby CHRIST, though born at Bethlehem,
grew up at Nazareth,--had for its object the fulfilment of many a detached and seemingly disconnected
prophecy[574],--shall the unexpectedness of His disclosure excite ridicule in such an one as
thyself? When He tells thee that besides the immediate scope of certain well-known words of
Hosea and of Jeremiah, there was the ulterior aim He indicates; if behind Israel after the
flesh, He shews thee the Anointed SON[575],--if behind those captive Jews of the tribe of Benjamin
whom Nebuzar-Adan led past their mother's grave on their way to Babylon, He points to the slaughtered
infant of Bethlehem; assuring thee that when He spake by the mouth of Jeremiah concerning the
nearer event that remoter one was full before Him also; and that the solemn and affecting utterance
of the Prophet was divinely intended by Himself to cover both[576];--wilt thou, when He discourses
to thee thus, presume to talk to Him of "accommodation?" Is it not enough for thee to have
cavilled at the first page of the Old Testament on "scientific" grounds? Must thou, for Theological
considerations, dispute the first page of the New Testament also?

Scripture then, whether in its Historical or its more obviously prophetic parts, has this depth
of meaning for which I have been contending. We must perforce believe it, for it is a matter
of express Revelation. We cannot pretend to deny the probability,--much less the possibility
of it; for we really can know nothing of the matter except from an attentive study of Scripture
itself. It was deemed a sufficient answer, at all events, by the Anointed JEHOVAH; whatever
men may think!... When the Sadducees, disbelieving in the Resurrection of the Body, assailed
our LORD with a speculative difficulty, He told them that they erred because they did not understand
the Scriptures. For He is not a GOD of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto Him[578]."
How, by the popular method,--how, by any of the new lights which have lately been let in on
Holy Scripture,--was the Resurrection of the dead to have been proved by the words which the
SECOND PERSON in the Trinity spake to Moses "in the Bush?" And yet we behold that same Divine
Personage in the days of His humiliation, proposing from those words, uttered by Himself 1500
years before, to establish the doctrine in dispute!... Only once more. You will look a long
while to find it. You will never find it at all if you adhere to the method which of late has
been declared to be the method most in fashion. You will never even understand what our Blessed
LORD means, unless you attend to the hint which immediately follows,--and which the Divine
Author of the Gospel would not surfer us to be without,--namely, that, "This spake He of the
SPIRIT, which they that believe on Him should receive:"--by which is meant, that as many of
the Prophets as discoursed in dark phrase of that free outpouring of the SPIRIT which was to
mark MESSIAH'S Reign, did, in effect, say the thing which He here attributes to them.

Inspired Reasoning, wherever found, may fitly obtain a few words of distinct notice here; but
I shall perhaps speak more becomingly, as well as prove more intelligible, if,--(without further
allusion to the sayings of that Almighty One "in whom are hid all the treasures of Wisdom and
Knowledge[580];" sayings which it seems a species of impiety to approach except in adoration;)--I
confine my remarks to the logical processes observable in the inspired writings of some of
His servants, the Evangelists and Apostles of THE LAMB.

The difficulty which has been occasionally felt in respect of the argumentative parts of St.
Paul's Epistles, is considerable, and may not be overlooked. His definitions, his inferences,
his entire method of handling Scripture, gives offence to a certain class of minds. His reasoning
seems inconsequential. There appears to be a want of logical order and consistency in much
that he delivers. But,--can it require to be stated?--the fault is entirely our own. "The radical
fallacy of any attempt to analyze the reasoning of Scripture by the ordinary Laws of Logic"
requires to be pointed out. And the root of it all is our assumption that an inspired Apostle
must perforce argue like any other uninspired man.

But, in the first place, it is to be recollected that he did not collect the meaning and bearing
of the Old Testament Scriptures from induction, and study only. He was,--by the hypothesis,--an
inspired Writer. The same HOLY SPIRIT who taught the authors of the Old Testament what to deliver,
taught him, in turn, how to explain their words. By direct Revelation, he perceived the intention
of a text, and at once bore witness to it. Now, "the Apostles quoted such places as these from
the Psalms and Isaiah, not as they were gathered by any certain reason, but as revealed to
them by the HOLY SPIRIT, to be principally spoken of CHRIST. This understanding the mysteries
of GOD in the Old Testament, being a special gift of the HOLY GHOST[582],--of the truth of
which interpretations, the same SPIRIT, without any necessary demonstration thereof, bore witness
also to their auditors and converts; and by miracles manifested the persons thus expounding
them herein to be infallible[583]."

To quote the language of a thoughtful writer of more recent date,--"Inspired teaching,--explain
it how we may,--seems comparatively indifferent to (what seems to us so peculiarly important)
close logical connexion, and the intellectual symmetry of doctrines.... The necessity of confuting
gainsayers, at times forced one of the greatest of CHRIST'S inspired servants, St. Paul, to
prosecute continuous argument; yet even with him, how abrupt are the transitions, how intricate
the connexion, how much is conveyed by assumptions such as Inspiration alone can make, without
any violation of the canons of reasoning,--FOR WITH IT ALONE ASSERTION IS ARGUMENT.... The
same may be said of some passages of St. John, supposed to have been similarly occasioned.
Inspiration has ever left to human Reason the filling up of its outlines, the careful connexion
of its more isolated truths. The two are, as the lightning of Heaven, brilliant, penetrating,
far-flashing, abrupt,--compared with the feebler but continuous illumination of some earthly
beacon[584]."

"In a train of inspired Seasoning," (as the same writer elsewhere remarks,) "each new premiss
may have been supernaturally communicated; and thus, in point of fact, the inspired reasoner
but connects the different threads of the Divine Counsels; exemplifies how 'deep answereth
to deep' in the mysteries of Revelation; and presents, in one connected train of argument,
those words of GOD which had been uttered 'at sundry times and in divers manners[585]'"

To conclude.--There is no such thing as inconsequential Reasoning to be met with in the writings
of St. Paul[586]--no such thing as arbitrary Accommodation of the Old Testament Scriptures,
in the New:--though not a few have thought it; and the language of many more writers, Papist
as well as Protestant, is calculated to convey the same mischievous impression[587]. The hypothesis
is as unworthy of ourselves,--with our boasted critical resources and many appliances of varied
learning,--as it is derogatory to the Sacred Oracles to which it is applied. It is a deadly
blow, aimed at the very Inspiration of Scripture itself; for it pretends to discover a human
element only, where we have a right to expect a Divine one: an irresponsible dictum, when we
listened for the voice of the SPIRIT; the hand of man, where we depended on finding the very
Finger of GOD! We come to the blessed pages, for Divinity, and we are put off with Rhetoric.
We come for bread, and the critics we speak of offer us a stone.

I will not detain you any longer. No apology can be needed for the subject which has been engaging
our attention[588]. Those who watch "the signs of the times" attentively, will bear me witness
that unbelief is one fearful note of the coming age. The self-same principle, working in different
classes of minds, produces results diametrically different: but it is still the same principle
which is at work. Unbelief is no less the cause why so many have forsaken the Church of their
Fathers, to run after the blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits of the Church of Rome,--than
it is the parent of that shallow Rationalism which unhappily is now so popular among us....
Intimations of what is to be hereafter, may be every now and then detected. At intervals, hoarse
sounds, from a distance, are known to smite upon the listening ear; signals of the coming danger,--sure
harbingers of the approaching storm.--Holy Scripture is the stronghold against which the Enemy
will make his assault, assuredly: nor can we employ ourselves better than by building one another
up in reverence for its Inspired Oracles: opposing to the crafts of the Evil One the simplicity
of a child-like faith; and resolutely refusing to see less than GOD, in GOD'S Word!

This must be the preacher's apology for disputing where he would rather adore; for discussing
the Revelations of Scripture, instead of feeding upon them; especially at this holy Season
when the Apostle's exhortation finds an echo in all our services:--the mouth, engaged in the
constant confession that JESUS is the LORD,--the heart, filled with the thought of Him, who
as at this time died for our sins, and rose again for our Justification.

GOD grant us grace,--at this and every other time,--so to put away the leaven of malice and
wickedness, that we may always serve Him in pureness of living and truth: through the merits
of the same His SON, JESUS CHRIST our LORD!

[540] I cannot forbear transcribing the following passage in an elaborate apology which has
recently appeared for Essays and Reviews:--"Among the many proposals which are floating about
for Essays and Counter-essays to vindicate the Doctrines supposed to be combated in this volume,
let us be allowed to suggest this one:--'The Nature of Biblical Inspiration, as tested by a
careful examination of the Septuagint Version with special reference to the sanction given
to it by the Apostles, and to its variations, by way of addition or omission, from the revised
Text of the Canonical Scriptures.' The conclusions of such an investigation would be worth
a hundred eager declarations on one side or the other, and would be absolutely decisive of
the chief questions at issue." (Edinburgh Review, April, 1861, p. 483.).... Now I scruple not
to affirm that a well-informed, and faithful student of the Scriptures would covet no better
portion for himself than liberty to accept, in the most public manner possible, such a challenge
as the foregoing.

[588] In the earlier part of the present Sermon many passages have been re-written. What follows
stands exactly as it was preached in 1851.

On a certain occasion, the Son of Man was asked what was thought a hard question by those who,
in His day, professed "the negative Theology[590]." There was a moral and there was physical
marvel to be solved. Both difficulties were met by a single sentence. The Sadducean judgment
had gone astray from the Truth, (πλανᾶσθε our SAVIOUR said,) from a twofold cause: (1) The
men did not understand those very Scriptures to which they appealed so confidently: and, (2)
They had an unworthy notion of GOD'S power.--There are plenty of Sadducees at the present day
among ourselves. They are as fond as ever of finding difficulties in the self-same Scriptures.
They are to be met, I am persuaded, exactly as of old; by shewing that their error is still
the fruit of their ignorance of Scripture; the consequence of their unworthy conceptions of
GOD. I propose to illustrate this on the present occasion. My subject, (one certainly not unsuited
to the day,) is the Marvels of Scripture,--whether Moral or Physical. I would fain have discussed
them apart; but I shall not have another opportunity. I must handle the whole subject therefore
within the limits of a single Sermon: and by consequence I must be extremely brief.

Now, I venture to assume that whatever, from its extraordinary character, perplexes us in Scripture,
is a difficulty only to ourselves; that moral Marvels and physical Miracles, alike, would cease
to create any difficulty if we knew more about GOD. The Morality of the Life to come, I do
believe will prove none other than the Morality of the life which now is; and so I presume
that it may be their Divine Author's will, that the physical Laws of the Universe shall be
eternal likewise. And yet, as no thoughtful man will probably be found to say that he thinks
he knows as much about the nature of these last now, as he expects to know hereafter,--so it
is to be presumed that a sublimer, and therefore a juster view of the relation in which the
Creature stands to the CREATOR, will disclose to us much which, at present, we should be little
prepared to admit, if it were speculatively presented to us, ("as in a glass, darkly,") respecting
the Moral Government of GOD.

I. In the very fore-front, however, of what I have to say concerning those phenomena which
are generally cited as the Moral Marvels of Holy Scripture, I must freely declare my opinion
that nothing is wanted but that the whole of the historical evidence should be before us, in
every case, in order that we might cease to look upon them as marvels at all. But so it is,
that Scripture is severely brief: takes no pains to conciliate our good opinion: seems to care
nothing either for our applause or our censure. Scripture, in short, has been made an instrument
of Man's probation[591]. It is for us to search curiously into the record; to take an enlarged
view of times and manners; and finally, in the exercise of a generous Faith, to decide whether
the difficulty is such as ought to occasion us any real distress. I proceed, in this spirit,
to consider, as briefly as possible, the history of Jael; simply because I have heard stronger
things said against her, than against any of the Worthies of old time who are mentioned with
distinct approbation in the Book of Life.

1. Now, if you choose to consider Jael as one who lured a weary and unsuspecting soldier into
her tent,--shewed him hospitality,--and when he was asleep, murdered him in cold blood,--you
certainly cannot help recoiling from the inspired decision that, "Blessed above women shall
Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be." But I take the liberty of saying that this is quite
the wrong way to read her story. You must begin it from the other end.

GOD pronounces this woman blessed, and distinctly commends her for her deed. From this point
you must start; remembering that no action CAN be immoral which GOD praises. The Divine sentence,
instead of creating a difficulty, is, on the contrary, exactly the thing which removes it[592].
To weigh the story apart from this, (which is the prime consideration of all,) is like condemning
the immorality of an executioner without caring to hear that he is but carrying out the sentence
of the Lawgiver. Furnished with the clue of GOD'S approbation of Jael's deed, we retrace our
steps, and reconsider the narrative. If all were still dark and hopeless, we might be sure
that there are circumstances withheld, which if known would have made GOD'S justice clear as
the light. But, as a matter of fact, it generally happens that, when we "know the Scriptures,"
the difficulty in great measure disappears; and I am going to shew that it is so on the present
occasion.

I find that when the people of GOD were on their way out of Egypt into Canaan, they were indebted
to one family (the Kenites) for kindness and help[593]. The head of that family was Jethro,
the father-in-law of Moses, high-priest of Midian,--in which land the LORD, from the burning
bush, had commissioned the future Lawgiver of Israel to redeem His people from the bondage
of Egypt. Jethro met them in the Arabian desert; became their guide[594] till they reached
the promised Land; and with them entered the borders of their future possession. It was a covenant
between the two races that they should share the goodness of JEHOVAH. Accordingly, the Kenites
made their settlement amid the Royal tribe of Judah; and it is easy to foresee how close a
bond would spring up between the alien family and their avowed protectors, when, to the memory
of past dangers shared together, was superadded the consciousness of present blessings;--especially
in an age when the law of hospitality was held most sacred. How strong the bond became, the
sequel of the story convincingly shews[595]. The children of Israel, at the end of a hundred
and fifty years, find themselves cruelly oppressed by the most powerful of the Kings of the
conquered but not extirpated race. GOD promises deliverance: and Deborah is raised up to organize
the resistance against Jabin, "the captain of whose host was Sisera." Now, while Heber the
Kenite is gone with the rest to the battle,--(for he had pitched his tent, remember, by Kedesh;
and it was from Kedesh[596] that Deborah "sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam;")--while
Heber, the husband, I say, is gone to the battle, and Jael the wife is left alone, distracted
with anxiety, in the tent;--when, weak and unprotected woman as she is, she beholds the Captain
of the hateful oppressor of GOD'S people hastening to her tent, slumbering at her feet, and
unexpectedly within her power:--will you pretend that she, a Midianitess, is to blame if she
yields to the strong impulse which prompts her to compass the man's downfall, as speedily as
she may? True: (between Jabin,--not between Sisera, by the way:) without this, the whole incident
would not have happened. Sisera presumed on the peaceful relations which existed between his
lord and Heber; and supposed that the sympathy of one alien race for another was to outweigh
every other consideration. Yet, how stood the case? Heber had thrown in his lot, irrevocably,
with the people of GOD; while Jabin had already utterly violated the conditions of peace. For
twenty weary years, had Jael and her family shared the hardships of that sacred line which
Jabin had "mightily oppressed." All her life long[598], the highways have been unoccupied;
and travellers have had to walk through by-ways; and the villages have been deserted by their
inhabitants. Archers have infested the very places of drawing water[599]. Meanwile, a sure
word has gone forth from the Prophetess who dwells under the palm-tree between Ramah and Bethel
on Mount Ephraim[600], to the effect that GOD will give a mighty victory this day to His people[601].
Moreover, Deborah, (to whom the children of Israel go up for judgment,) has foretold that the
LORD will "sell Sisera into the hand of a woman[602]". How can you marvel at the rest!... With
a faith strong and undoubting as Rahab's, Jael,--weak woman as she is,--seizes the wooden tent-pin
and the mallet, (the only weapons which are within her reach!); and, (somewhat as David afterwards
employed a stone and a sling for the slaughter of the Philistine,) with these vile instruments,
at one blow, she smites to the earth the enemy of God's people.... O, it was not because she
was treacherous, or because she was cruel! Treachery and cruelty were not the vices to which
a dweller in tents (and she a woman!) was prone, when a thirsty soldier begged a draught of
water; and most assuredly, had she been either, she would not,--she could not, have won praise
from God! (Witness GOD'S wrath against David in the matter of Uriah, because he had no pity[603];
as well as dying Jacob's denunciations against Simeon and Levi because "instruments of cruelty"
were "in their habitations[604].") O no! It was because she beheld in the slumbering captain
at once the enemy of her own afflicted race,--and of GOD'S oppressed people,--and above all
of GOD Himself. That was why "she put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's
hammer!" ... The fight, you are requested to remember, had been a tremendous fight; and the
battle, as she thought, was yet raging. Reuben, and Dan, and Asher had kept aloof from the
encounter;--the first, in his rich pasture-land east of the Jordan, abiding "among the sheepfolds,
to hear the bleatings of the flocks;" the two others, intent on their maritime pursuits. Only
some of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh[605], had been found willing to throw in their lot
with the two northern tribes of Zebulun, and Naphtali,--who had "jeoparded their lives unto
the death." And the battle which these had fought had been the LORD'S; and as many as had taken
part with them, were considered to have come "to the help of the LORD." Such then was the quarrel
which Jael had made her own; and such the spirit in which she had done her wild deed of unassisted
prowess!

To appreciate her constancy and courage, you may not overlook how fearful were the odds against
the cause she was espousing: on the oppressor's side, nine hundred chariots of iron; whereas,
"was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?" It had been so terrific
a day, that if the LORD had not been on their side,--if the stars in their courses had not
fought for Israel,--how could Sisera have possibly been overcome? But the very river was employed
to sweep the enemies of Israel away,--"that ancient river, the river Kishon!" ... Now I boldly
ask you, if the Angel of the LORD may curse bitterly the inhabitants of Meroz, "because they
came not to the help of the LORD,"--(pray mark that phrase; for it shows exactly in what light
the conflict was regarded!)--"to the help of the LORD against the mighty;" shall we wonder
if, by the Spirit of GOD, Deborah the prophetess proclaims "blessed above women in the tent"
Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite to be;--the undaunted one by whose right hand the captain
of all that mighty host had been slain? Find me another "woman in the tent" who may be compared
with her! ... Or rather, (for that is the only question,) shall these words embolden us to
impeach the morality of Holy Writ?... I am sure there is not one of you all who really thinks
it. She was--was she not?--a courageous, a faithful, and (according to her light,) a strictly
virtuous woman. She was content to risk all, "as seeing Him who is invisible:" and to believe
that "they that be with us are more than they that be with them[606]." From the unmistakeable
evidence of her uncompromising boldness in a good cause, her unwavering faith, her readiness
to cast in her lot with the people of GOD,--no one but a hypocrite will turn away to criticize
the details of her deed by the Gospel standard of Grace and Truth. "He asked for water, and
she gave him milk." What would you have had her do? It is by no means certain that she foresaw
the deed which was to follow, and which cannot, (from the nature of the case,) have been the
result of a preconcerted plan. The impulse to terminate the tyranny of Canaan, and the sufferings
of her adopted people, as well as to decide the fortune of that critical day, by slaying one
whom she regarded as the enemy of GOD Himself, may have seized her while she stood in the door
of the tent,--weighing Sisera's petition against Deborah's prophecy. Be this as it may,--would
you have had the woman connive at Sisera's escape,--the enemy of GOD'S people, when GOD Himself
had unexpectedly put him into her power?

It will assist us to understand this story, that we should bear in mind how it fared with Ahab,
King of Israel, in the matter of Ben-hadad, King of Syria, as recorded in the xxth chapter
of the First Book of Kings. "Thus saith the LORD," (was the Divine sentence,) "Because thou
hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life
shall go for his life, and thy people for his people[607]." It is quite evident that as the
enemy of GOD, in the strictest sense, each fresh oppressor of Israel was regarded; and that,
as the enemy of the LORD GOD of Israel, Sisera was summarily slain by the Kenite's wife.

Be so good as to remember also, that forgiveness of enemies is strictly a Christian duty. You
have no right to expect to find the brightest jewels of the kingdom of Heaven glittering on
the swarthy brow of an Arabian wife in the days of the Judges. "Grace and Truth came by JESUS
CHRIST[608]." You cannot expect to find the wife of Heber the Kenite more truthful than Sarah,
and Rebekah, and Rachel,--or even than Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and David: neither should
you be so unreasonable as to expect that the GOD of Truth will award praise and blame to His
creatures by a higher standard of Morality than He has seen fit, at any given period, to allow.
A perfectly enlightened conscience, no doubt, will never consent to lie. A Christian woman
in Jael's place, ought not, of course, to be guilty of Jael's deed. But you are forgetting
the time of the world in which your lot is thrown. I say nothing of the circumstances of terror
under which she acted,--she was forced to act. How could she tell that Sisera would not awake
ere she should strike the blow,--or at least before she could achieve his death? What if a
company of Jabin's host should come up to the tent-door, the instant she had done the deed,
and inquire after Sisera? Suppose the issue of that day's encounter should prove disastrous,
what would be her own and Heber's fate?... Feel a little for the poor wife,--for the lonely,
helpless "woman in the tent,"--not entirely for the fierce soldier against whom you have heard
the LORD'S decree of death!... O ye, who, living in the full blaze of Gospel light, in cold
blood can reject the doctrine of the Atonement, and deny the LORD who bought you, and teach
that the Bible is "like any other book;" who can make light of its Inspiration, and evacuate
its Prophecy, and idealize its Miracles; who with your lips can profess the Church's doctrines,
and with your pens can deny them;--go ye and prate of Morality, and Honesty, and Truth! We
shall heed mighty little your opinion of Jael's conduct, and of the Divine Commendation which
it met with. I believe that, instead of suspecting the morality of the Bible in this instance,
there is hardly an honest Christian heart among us, but cries out, on the contrary,--"So let
all Thine enemies perish, O LORD! But let them that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth
in his might."

2. There is no time to consider, as I fain would, any other story; that of Jacob for example.
It is quite amazing to hear the presumptuous speeches concerning that great Saint, in which
good men sometimes permit themselves: as if the sum total of Jacob's history were this:--that
he once obtained an ungenerous advantage over his Brother, and then shamefully deceived his
blind and aged Father. Whereas those were the two great blots in an otherwise holy life! actions
which were followed by severe, aye lifelong punishment.--But I must not enter on Jacob's history,--even
to shew you that a careless reader overlooks certain circumstances which go a very long way
indeed to excuse the actions just alluded to. I prefer reminding you that since, at Bethel,
GOD blessed the exile's slumbers with a glorious vision, and most comfortable promise, on his
first setting out for Haran; and again at Jabbok, as well as at Mahanaim, blessed him with
a vision of Angels, and a renewal of the blessing, on his return; from this point, as before,
it will be our wisdom to reason; and we shall reason backwards. Had Scripture been quite silent
in all other respects, such proofs of the Divine approval ought to be enough to convince a
believing heart that the only thing wanting must be fuller details,--more evidence,--in order
to shew us that the Patriarch deserved the SPIRIT'S praise. But in truth, in Jacob's case,
the details are abundant and the evidence decisive.

3. Of all the other (so called) difficulties which occur to my memory,--as the extinction of
the Canaanites, (who yet were not extinguished,)--the Sacrifice of Isaac, (who yet was not
sacrificed,)--the life of David;--I have only to say that before you can pretend to have an
opinion upon the subject you must be sure that you "know the Scriptures:" else, I make bold
to say, you will inevitably err in your cogitations concerning them. Thus, men are heard to
insinuate astonishment that the King who so basely compassed Uriah's death should have been
"a man after GOD'S own heart:" whereas the Hebrew original, (as they would know, if they knew
the Scriptures,) conveys nothing of the kind; while the murder of Uriah is found to have drawn
down upon David unmitigated wrath and terrible punishment from the right Hand of Him who is
of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.

II. Turn we now, briefly, to the physical Marvels which are described in the Bible; and chiefly
those which occur in the Old Testament.

I am about to speak of Miracles in general; but it may be convenient to say a few words first
about certain mighty transactions which eclipse, by their vastness or their strangeness, most
isolated events. Thus, as the Nativity, Temptation, Transfiguration, Resurrection, Ascension,
of our LORD, together with the Coming of the HOLY GHOST, eclipse in a manner the other Miracles
of the New Testament,--so the Temptation of our first Parents, the Flood, the destruction of
Sodom and the fate of Lot's wife, the burning bush, the Plagues which prepared the way for
the Exode, the crossing of the Red Sea, the Manna, and the brazen Serpent; Balaam's ass, and
the fate of the walls of Jericho; the history of Jonah, and of Daniel among the lions:--events
like these stand out from the Old Testament narrative and challenge astonishment.

Of all these latter events, viewed as difficulties,--(for it is as difficulties in the way
of Revelation that we are now expected to look on Miracles,)--you are requested to observe
that they enjoy, one and all, the confirmation of express citation in the New Testament. I
am saying that either St. Paul, or St. Peter, or St. James, or (above all) our Blessed LORD
Himself, appeal to, or else explain, every one of these marvellous passages in Old Testament
History. And this is the only remark I propose to offer concerning any of them. It will certainly
prove unavailing to convince a certain class of persons of the historical reality of the Deluge,
to find that our SAVIOUR, that St. Peter, and St. Paul, have all spoken of it as an actual
event:--Men who are disposed to reject the story of the dumb ass speaking with man's voice,
will not perhaps believe it one whit the more because they find it appealed to by St. Peter[609]:--and
the Divine exposition offered by CHRIST Himself of Jonah, three days and three nights in the
fish's belly, will not, it may be feared, reconcile others to an event which strikes them as
being too improbable to be true. But this, at least, will infallibly result from the discovery:--men
will perceive that they must positively make their election; and either accept the Bible as
a whole, or else reject it as a whole; for that there is no middle course open to them. The
New Testament stands committed irrevocably to the Old. Every Book of the Bible stands committed
to all the other Books. Not only does our LORD quote the Canon in its collected form, and call
it "the Law and the prophets,"--or simply ἡ γραφή, "the Scripture,"--and so set His seal upon
it, as one undivided and indivisible roll of Inspiration; but He and His Apostles single out
the very narratives which the imbecility of Man was most likely to stumble at, and employ them
for such purposes, and in such a manner, that escape from them shall henceforth be altogether
hopeless. To eliminate the marvels of Scripture, I say, is impossible; for a Divine Hand has
been laid upon almost every one of them. The subsequent references are not only most numerous,
but they run into the very staple of the narrative,--and will not,--cannot be eradicated.

I question whether all students of the inspired page are aware of the extent to which what
I have been saying holds true. Let me only invite you to investigate the structure of the Bible
under this aspect, and you will be astonished at the result. For you will find that the system
of tacit quotation and allusive reference is so perpetual, that it is as if the design had
been that the fibres should be incapable of being disentangled any more. Balaam's story for
example in the Book of Numbers, is found alluded to in Deuteronomy, in Joshua, in Micah, in
Nehemiah; by St. Peter, by St. Jude, and by St. John in the Apocalypse[610].--The Exodus, with
its attendant wonders, is alluded to in Joshua, and in Judges, and in Job, and in the Psalms;
in Amos, and Isaiah, and Micah, and Hosea, and Jeremiah, and Daniel; in Kings, in Samuel, in
Nehemiah; and in the New Testament repeatedly[611]. The Evangelists quote one another times
without number. In the Epistles, the Gospels are quoted upwards of fifty times; and St. Peter
quotes St. Paul again and again. It is a favourite device of these last days to hint at the
allegorical character of the beginning of Genesis. But I find upwards of thirty references
in the New Testament to the first two Chapters of Genesis[612]. Certain parts of Daniel have
incurred suspicion,--for no better reason, as it seems, than because certain persons have found
it hard to believe that Prophecy can be "an anticipation of History[613]." Now it is strange
certainly to find a thing objected to for being what it is: and "Prophecy is nothing but the
history of events before they come to pass,"--as Butler remarked long ago[614]. Waiving this,
however, you are requested to observe that our SAVIOUR quotes from those very parts of Daniel
which have been objected to. You cannot get rid of those parts of Daniel therefore. You are
not to suppose that the Bible is like an old house, where a window may be darkened, or a door
blocked up, according to the caprice of every fresh occupant. The terms on which men dwell
there are that every part of the structure shall be inhabited; and that every part shall be
retained in its integrity. What I am insisting upon is, that the sacred Writers plainly say,--We
stand or we fall together. They reach forth their hands, and they hold one another fast. They
rehearse comprehensive Genealogies,--they furnish a summary view of long histories,--they enumerate
the various worthies of old time, and cite their deeds in order. They recognize one another's
voices, and they interpret one another's thoughts, and they adopt one another's sayings. Verily
the Bible is not "like any other Book!" The prophets and Apostles and Evangelists of either
covenant reach out one to another; and lo, among them is seen the form of One like the SON
of GOD.... How far it may be rational to reject the Bible, I will not now discuss: but it is
demonstrable that a man cannot accept the Bible, and straightway propose to omit from it one
jot or one tittle of its contents. As for abstracting from Scripture the marvels of Scripture,
it is precisely for the protection and preservation of them, as I have been shewing, that the
most curious and abundant provision has been made.

1. The miracles, properly so called, whether of the Old or New Testament, have lately been
cavilled at with exceeding bitterness[615]. That they are sufficiently attested, is allowed[616];
the objection is a (so called) Philosophical one, and is briefly this,--that the Laws of Nature
being fixed and immutable, it is contrary not only to experience, but also to reason, to suppose
that they have ever been suspended, or violated, or interrupted. Events "contrary to the order
of Nature,"--events which would introduce "disorder" into Creation,--are pronounced incredible.--This
is a very old objection; but it has been lately revived. I will dispose of it as briefly as I can.

You are requested to observe then, that this difficulty,--(such as it is,)--is entirely occasioned
by the terms in which it is stated. Who ever asserted that Miracles are "violations of natural
causes[617]?" "suspensions of natural laws[618]?" Who ever said that the effect of Miracles
is to "interrupt"--"violate"--"reverse,"--the Laws of Nature? Why assume "contrariety" and
"disorder" in a κόσμος which seems to have had no experience of either?

But GOD is, I suppose, superior to His own Laws! He is not the creature of circumstances,--even
of His own creating. Supreme is He in Creation,--albeit in a manner which baffles thought.
He does not even suspend His Laws, perhaps, so much as fulfil them after a Diviner fashion;--somewhat
as He was fulfilling the Mosaic Economy even while He seemed to be violating one or other of
its sanctions. He does not reverse or disorder the fixed course of Nature, so much as rise
above it, and shew Himself superior to it. He does not disturb anything, but our notions of
His mode of acting. GOD coming suddenly to view in Nature, (which is an essential part of the
notion of a miracle,) occasions perplexity, it is true; but only because we do not understand
fully either Nature or GOD. "We know Him not as He is, neither indeed can know Him." While
of Nature, we know nothing but a few Laws which we have discovered by a long and laborious
induction of phenomena. In fact, this whole manner of speaking concerning the Creator of the
Universe, with reference to the Laws which He is found to have prescribed to things natural,
has, I suspect, some great foolishness in it: for, even if we do not so far dishonour GOD as
to imagine that He is subject to Law, yet we seem to imply that we think ourselves capable
of understanding the relation in which He stands to Law. Whereas, the very notion of Law may
be utterly inapplicable to GOD,--who is not only its first Author, (as He is indeed the first
Author of all things,) but the very source and cause of it also. So that what are Laws to ourselves
may be not so much as Law at all to GOD; but, (if I may so speak,) something which depends
on "the counsel of His will," and which, (considered as a restraining cause,) is to Him as
if it were not. There can be no miracles with GOD[619]!

Briefly then:--That He who, (surely I may say confessedly,) is above Law, when He manifests
Himself in the midst of Creation, should act in a manner which defies conception; and yet should
disturb nothing, reverse nothing, violate nothing;--(except to be sure, possibly, certain preconceived
notions of His rational creatures;)--in this, I say, there is surely nothing either incredible
or absurd.

2. So much, to say the truth, seems to be admitted, by all but professed Atheists. But then,
certain formulæ have been invented to bridge over the difficulty, which Miracles are supposed
to occasion, which I cannot but think are just as objectionable as unbelief itself.

By way of saving the credit of "the Laws of the Universe," a kind of compromise has been discovered;
to which I do not find that GOD has been made any party.

The idea of Law, which has been falsely declared to be only now "emerging into supremacy in
Science[620]," seems to have usurped such a dominion over the minds of a few persons, superficially
acquainted with Physical studies, that Miracles can be only tolerated on the supposition that
they are "the exact fulfilment of much more extensive Laws than those we suppose to exist[621]."
We are kindly assured that what we call a Miracle is not "an exception to those laws which
we know, but really the fulfilment of a wider Law which we did not know before[622]." Men are
eager to remind us that this is the view of Bp. Butler[623], (whom every one, I observe, is
fond of having for an ally.) Thus, a very recent writer says,--"What we call interferences
may, (as Bp. Butler observed long ago,) be fulfilments of general laws not perfectly apprehended
by us[624]."--But I cannot find that Bp. Butler anywhere says anything of the sort. What Butler
says, is,--that we know nothing of the laws of storms and earthquakes,--tempers and geniuses;--yet
we conclude, (but only from analogy,) that all these seemingly accidental things are the result
of general laws. Now, (he proceeds,) since it is only "from our finding that the course of
Nature, in some respects and so far, goes on by general laws, that we conclude this of the
rest;"--it is credible "that GOD'S miraculous interpositions may have been, all along, in like
manner, by general laws of WISDOM." Butler says that it "may have been by general laws," "that
the affairs of the world, being permitted to go on in their natural course so far, should,
just at such a point, have a new direction given them by miraculous interposition." He does
not say, you observe, that those "miraculous interpositions" are "the exact fulfilment of much
more extensive Laws than those we suppose to exist;" (as if a larger induction were all that
was needed, in order to get rid of the obnoxious word "Miracle:")--not, that Miracles may be
"fulfilments of general laws not perfectly apprehended by us;" (as if the only thing wanted,
were an enlargement of the human formula, in order to bring a miraculous interposition within
the definition of an extraordinary phenomenon.) Such notions belong altogether to the inventors
of calculating machines; whose speculations, even concerning Divine things, clearly cannot
soar above their instrument[625]. It is called the "argument from laws intermitting[626];"
and evidently reduces a miracle to a phenomenon of periodical recurrence. The aloe, watched
for ninety-nine years and observed to blossom in the hundredth, is (according to this view)
an emblem of the constitution of Nature at last interrupted by a Miracle.

I will not waste your time further with this view of the subject, having exposed its fallacy.
Station yourself, in thought, at the grave of Lazarus; and see him that was dead and had been
four days buried, come forth bound hand and foot with grave-clothes;--and then prate of any
"general Laws," except those "OF WISDOM," to as many as you can get to listen to you. A "miraculous
interposition," (as Butler phrases it,) has given a new direction to affairs which, so far,
had been permitted to go in their natural course. That "general Laws" of inscrutable Wisdom
determined such a "miraculous interposition"--is a position which, so far from objecting to,
I embrace with both the arms of my heart[627].

3. Another favourite recipe there is for escaping from the bondage of Miracles, which is so
childish, that it would seem scarcely to deserve notice: but that it has been largely resorted
to by writers of whom the world thinks highly. Those men, in a word, try to explain them away
where they can: where they cannot, they pare them down as much as they are able, or rather
as much as they dare. Demoniacal possession? Symptoms like those described are known to accompany
epilepsy. Manna? Something like it falls in the wilderness of Sinai to this hour. The Red Sea
parted? Well, but a strong East wind blew all night. Stilling the storm, and healing Peter's
wife's mother? Every storm is stilled if let alone; and a fever will burn out, often without
occasioning death. The miraculous draught of fishes, and the stater in the fish's mouth?...
but you can readily supply a suggestion for yourselves.

Now, two remarks present themselves on this kind of handling, which may be worth stating. (1)
Those who so speak forget that the Devils are related to have conversed with CHRIST[628]:--that
the manna, (of which so many miraculous properties are related[629],) fed 600,000 men for forty
years, and then suddenly ceased[630]:--that the waters of the Red Sea were a wall to the children
of Israel, on their right hand and on their left[631]:--that when CHRIST said to the waves
of the sea of Galilee "Peace, be still," "there was a great calm[632]:"--that Peter's wife's
mother, cured of her fever, "rose and ministered unto," (that is "waited upon,") her Benefactor[633]....
It is worse than absurd to explain away part of a miracle, with a view to getting rid of the
whole of it: as if the essence of the miracle were not sure to reside in the residuum,--in
the very part which is left unaccounted for! (2) But above all, what place have such explanations
in the recorded cases of feeding the multitudes, opening the eyes of one born blind, and raising
the dead? While you leave the chiefest miracles of the Gospel untouched, you may not flatter
yourself that you have got at the kernel of the matter; or indeed that the real question at
issue has been touched by you, at all.

4. There remains to notice one subtle and most treacherous method of dealing with the marvels
of Scripture,--(moral and physical alike,)--to which I desire in conclusion to direct your
special attention; and which I would brand with burning words if I had them at command. I allude
to what is called "IDEOLOGY,"--the plain English for which term is, a denial of the historical
reality of Scripture. I will not waste time with inquiring whether this method is old or new.
It is certainly much in fashion; and it is certainly finding advocates in high quarters. I
therefore make no apology for introducing the monstrous thing to your notice. It requires,
I should hope, only to be understood, to be rejected with unqualified indignation.

You and I, then, have been taught to believe that "the WORD was made flesh and dwelt among
us," in the way St. Matthew and St. Luke describe: that our LORD was Baptized and Tempted of
Satan; that He wrought Miracles,--casting out Devils, and even raising the Dead; that He was
Transfigured on a mountain; that He was Crucified, died, and was buried; that He rose again
the Third Day, ascended into Heaven, and at last, (as on this day,) sent down the PARACLETE
to dwell with His Church for ever. All this, I say, you and I,--with the whole Church Catholic
for 1800 years,--have been taught to believe as plain historical truths, mere matters of fact;
past telling wonderful indeed, but yet as historically true, as that I am standing here and
you are sitting yonder,--neither more nor less.

But you are to understand that we, and all mankind with us, have been under a very curious
delusion on this head. We are assured that every one of these things, or at least that some
of them, are only ideologically true: that Historically, they are false. In plain language,
we are requested to believe that they never occurred at all. It is only a lively way of putting
it,--no more!

You will inevitably suppose that I must be trifling with you: I therefore proceed to give you
a sample of this kind of teaching. A living dignitary of our Church writes as follows concerning
the Transfiguration of CHRIST. "It may be asked, of what kind was the vision which we here
call the Transfiguration? Was it an effect produced within on the minds of the Apostles; or
was it that an actual external change came for the time over the person of our LORD? We cannot
say." I give you this as the mildest form of the poison. Quite evident is it that the same
suggestion is just as applicable to our LORD'S Birth, or to His Death; to His Temptation, or
to His Resurrection. But to see whither all this tends, and what it really means, you must
have recourse to the pages of a more advanced proficient in the Science of Ideology. This writer,
(who is a clergyman of the Church of England, and a Graduate in Divinity,) goes on to idealize
the descent of Mankind from Adam and Eve, together with the chiefest marvels of the Old Testament:
insisting that "the force, grandeur, and reality of these ideas are not a whit impaired," although
we discredit and reject the history, as history. So, our SAVIOUR, (he says,) "is none the less
the Son of David, in idea and spiritually, even if it be unproved whether He were so in historic
fact." "The spiritual significance is still the same," (he says,) "of the Transfiguration,
of opening blind eyes, of causing the tongue of the stammerer to speak plainly, of feeding
multitudes with bread in the wilderness, of cleansing leprosy,--whatever links may be deficient
in the traditional record of particular events."

"Whatever links may be deficient!" O that men would have the courage or the honesty to say
what they mean! Why not say plainly, "however untrustworthy we may account the narrative to
be?" And this writer cannot mean any other thing; for missing "links," assuredly, there are
none.--In truth this method of wrapping up a monstrous abortion in "purple and fine linen,"
in order to make it look like "a proper child," is so much in vogue, that plain men are obliged
first to translate a fallacy in order to understand it. Thus, a recent Apologist for the very
writer I have been quoting,--after surrendering the beginning of Genesis as "parabolic," (that
is, not historically true,) is yet so obliging as to contend that "there still remain events"
in Scripture,--our LORD'S Resurrection to wit,--"in which the garb of flesh,"--(pray mark the
phraseology!)--"in which the garb of flesh seems to be so indispensable a vehicle for the spirit
within, that we can hardly conceive how the one could have sustained itself in the world, unless
it had been from the beginning allied to the other[634]." In plain English, the writer is so
candid as to admit that if the Resurrection of our LORD JESUS CHRIST from death be a mere fabrication,--in
plain terms, a hoax practised upon the credulity of an unscientific age,--it is hard to understand
how it can have imposed upon mankind so completely for the last eighteen hundred years.

I will not insult the understanding of those who hear me so grossly as to suppose that dreams
like these,--(and really they are no more!)--require answer or refutation. Such desperate shifts
to elude the meaning of plain words, as the whole theory of Ideology discloses, would be even
ludicrous, if the subject-matter were not so very sacred and solemn. As in the case of certain
acts of flagrant dishonesty which one sometimes reads of,--one cannot forbear exclaiming, The
man must certainly have felt himself very sore pressed indeed to have been induced to resort
to a step so utterly disgraceful to his character!... Anyhow, since certain persons have adopted
this course, I do but plead for consistency. Only let them be sure that they apply this precious
method of Interpretation to the History of England, and to everything their friend tells them:
and let them not feel surprised if the same kind of ideological handling is bestowed upon everything
they tell their friend. Idealize away, and be sure you stick at nothing! Why be outdone in
logical consistency by such an one as Strauss? Let men also make their election whether Scripture
shall be a lie or not. And when they have made up their minds, let them, in the Name of GOD,
instead of dealing in unmanly insinuations, and dark hints, and shuffling equivocations,--let
them declare themselves plainly, that we may know at least with whom and with what we have
to do. For while false Brethren are thus playing fast and loose with Revelation, they are trifling
with the faith of thousands,--and imperilling other immortal souls besides their own.

But I shall be reminded that the subject-matter of daily life, and of the Everlasting Gospel,
is very different: and that the marvellous character of certain events recorded in the Bible
constrains us to relegate those events to a distinct region. A child's plea, which was effectually
disposed of upwards of a century ago! What does it amount to but this,--that what is supernatural,
or even highly extraordinary, must be also untrue?... When, however, the argument is shifted,
and is made an appeal ad misericordiam:--when I am entreated to remember that though I believe
in the Resurrection of CHRIST from Death, the same event is a "stumbling block" to many; and
that I am "bound to treat with tenderness those who prefer to lean on the other, and, as they
think, more secure foundation[635];" (viz. on the hypothesis that the Resurrection of the Son
of Man is all a fable;)--I say, when I am so addressed, really, friends and Brethren, I am
constrained to cry out that there is a limit beyond which Nature cannot endure; and that that
limit has now been overstepped. Will men try to persuade us that the idea of our LORD'S Resurrection
is a more secure basis for the Church's faith than the fact of our LORD'S Resurrection? Why,
they might as well try to convince the world that a broken reed is a better support than an
oaken staff;--or that a handful of waste paper is of more value than the title-deeds of an
estate. How can a shadow,--how can what is confessedly an imagination,--be, in any sense, or
for any body, a "secure foundation;" or indeed, any foundation at all? how, above all, can
a fancy be a "more secure foundation" than a fact?... Not only will I not treat men with tenderness
who put forth such blasphemous folly,--(men who, in their rashness, their recklessness, their
arrogance, shew no manner of tenderness or consideration for others!)--but I will hold them
up to ridicule, to the very utmost of my power. Nay, I would make them objects of unqualified
reprobation to all, if I could, as they deserve to be reprobated; for they are the worst enemies
of the Gospel of CHRIST[636]. "If CHRIST be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
faith is vain also[637]!" "The Apostle rests the truth of the Christian Religion on the fact
that CHRIST was risen.... The whole system turns upon this central point; the several doctrines
gather round it, they depend upon it, they grow out of it; so that without it, Christianity
would have no coherence or meaning[638]."

You and I know very well "that nothing could more effectually shake the whole fabric of Revealed
Religion, than thus converting its history into fable, and its realities into fiction. For
if the narratives most usually selected for the purpose may thus be explained away; what part
of the Sacred History will be secure against similar treatment? Nay, what doctrines, even those
the most essential to Christianity, might not thus be undermined? For are not those doctrines
dependent upon the facts recorded in Scripture for the evidence of their truth? Does not, for
instance, the whole system of our Redemption presuppose the reality of the Fall as an historical
fact? And do not the proofs of the Divine authority of the whole, rest upon the verification
of its Prophecies and Miracles, as events which have actually taken place? Allegory thus misapplied
is therefore worse than frivolous or useless; it strikes a deadly blow at the very vitals of
the Christian Faith[639]." Away then with that very questionable form of liberality, which
makes most free with what belongs to GOD! The truths of Revelation are yours and mine, I grant
you: but only so yours and mine that, to our eternal blessedness, we embrace,--to our eternal
loss, we let them slip! We add to them, or we take away from them, under peril of GOD'S curse....
Away too with that mawkish sentimentality which can find no better object for its sympathy
than the hardened blasphemer, and the confirmed sceptic! My sympathy shall be reserved for
those who have never so offended, but are, on the contrary, full of precious promise;--for
the young and as yet inexperienced;--for you, who will have the battle of CHRIST and His Church
to fight, when we shall be mouldering in the grave. Let those who do not know me, deem me uncharitable
if they will. I care not. The uncharitable man,--mark me, Brethren!--the truly uncharitable
man, is he, who shews no consideration for weak and unstable souls; who does not regard the
trials and perils of the young; who beguiles unsteady feet to the edge of the precipice, and
there forsakes them; whose destructive method, (for constructiveness is no part of that man's
philosophy!)--whose destructive method leaves the young without chart and compass,--aye, without
moon or stars to sail by; who labours hard to communicate the taint of his own foul leprosy
to those who were before unpolluted; who dims the eye, and deadens the ear, and defiles the
thoughts, and darkens the hope of as many as have the misfortune to come in his way, and feels
no pity!--Yes, yes! The man who sows his own vile doubts broadcast over two continents,--doing
his very best to destroy the faith of those for whom CHRIST died,--he, he is the uncharitable
man[640]! Not he who, forsaking the flowery fields of the Gospel, (whither he would far, far
rather lead you!) and foregoing the free mountain air of imperishable Truth, for your sakes
only keeps treading these dreary stifling paths of speculation;--a friend of yours, I mean,
who with stammering eloquence, (the more's the pity!) clings thus to you, Sunday after Sunday,--imploring
you, with all a brother's earnestness, not to venture where to venture is to die; and warning
you against the men who have conspired against your life;--even while he labours hard to shew
you what he knows to be "a more excellent way;" and implores you to come where CHRIST Himself
hath promised that "ye shall find rest to your souls!"

This is all there is time for, to-day. Let me, in the fewest possible words, gather up what
has been spoken into a practical shape.

Friends and brethren,--(I am still addressing the younger men present!)--Divinity is not debate;
and Religion is not controversy; and Life is not long enough for perpetual disputings. "He
that cometh unto GOD must believe that He is." The heart dries up, and the affections wither
away, and the soul faints, amid an atmosphere of cloudy doubts, and captious difficulties,
and perverse disputations. You must rise above it, if you would discern the colours on the
everlasting hills, and behold the beauty of the promised Land, and see objects as they really
are. O put away from yourselves, (if any of you are so unhappy as to have acquired it,) a habit
of mind which will effectually unfit you for profiting by what you read in Holy Scripture:
and you, who are free from such dreadful bondage, beware lest, by the indulgence of some sin,--whether
of the flesh or of the spirit,--you darken that spiritual eye by which alone spiritual things
are to be discerned. It is like talking about colours to the blind, or about sounds to the
deaf, to discuss with a certain class of persons the Inspiration, or the Interpretation, or
the Marvels of Scripture. The Bible is, with them, a common book,--"to be interpreted like
any other book." Prophecy is denied, and Miracles are rejected or explained away,--on the plea
that they are alike incredible. These men lay claim to intellectual gifts above their fellows;
and know not that they are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked." Rebels
are they against the Most High; and find their exact image in those citizens who "sent a message
after Him, saying, We will not have this Man to reign over us[641]." The gist of all they deliver,
is rebellion against GOD.

But it is not so with yourselves, who have yet everything to learn in respect of Divine things.
O beware lest it ever become your own dreadful case! Begin betimes to acquaint yourselves with
the wealth of that celestial armoury which contains a weapon which must prove fatal to every
foe; but which it depends on yourselves whether you shall have the skill to wield or not. Suffer
not yourselves to be cheated of your birthright, the Bible, either by the novel fictions of
unstable men, or by the exploded heresies of a bygone age, revived and recommended by living
unbelievers. You, especially, who aspire to the Ministerial office, and are destined hereafter
to undertake the cure of souls, O do you be doubly watchful! Give to the Bible the undivided
homage of a childlike heart; and bow down before its revelations with a suppliant understanding
also; and let no characteristic of its method by any means escape you. Notice how it is indeed
all one long narrative, from end to end; and see therein GOD'S provision that nothing shall
be idealized, nothing explained away. Learn too that Man is thus called upon to look outward,
and to sustain himself by an external Law; not to depend on the promptings of his own conscience,
and so to become a god unto himself. The Bible, I repeat, is all severest history, from the
Alpha to the Omega of it. But then, underneath the surface there are meanings high as Heaven,
deep as Hell: and why? because the true Author of it is not Man, but GOD!

Let it quicken you in your desire to understand that Book out of which you will have hereafter
to preach, reprove, rebuke, exhort[642],--sometimes to bethink yourselves of the flocks which
already are expecting you; and among which GOD already sees your future going out and coming
in; your faithful teaching, or (GOD forbid!) your betrayal of a most sacred trust. Acquaint
yourselves in due time, by all means, with the scientific grounds on which the Bible is to
be received as the Word of GOD: but of a truth, hereafter, you will forget to require that
external testimony; for you will be convinced of its Divine origin, when you have become the
adoring witnesses of its Divine power. Truly that must be from GOD which can so change the
life and affect the heart; which can sustain the spirit under bereavement, and become the soul's
satisfying portion under every form of adversity! It has already altered the aspect of the
World; and it has still a mighty work to do in India, and in China, and in Africa, and in the
Islands of the Sea.

Difficulties there are in Scripture, doubtless: but I should be far more perplexed by the absence
of them, than I shall ever be by their presence. Nay, they are a chief source of joy to a rightly
constituted mind; for they exercise the moral nature and the intellectual powers, in the noblest
possible way. It is the office of the highest Intellect to know when to walk by Faith, and
when by sight: and when, to "ask for the old paths." It needs a mind of no common order fully
to recognize the distinctive difference between a system which comes from GOD; and one which
has been elaborated by human Reason: the latter progressive,--the former incapable of progress;
the one liable to change,--the other, unchangeable for ever. There are certain indelible characteristics
of a Divine Revelation, I say, which it is the office of the keenest wit to detect and hold
fast,--which it is a prime note of imbecility in a thoughtful man to overlook and let go....
The Bible in truth, as one grows older,--(to me at least it seems so,)--becomes almost the
only thing in the world really deserving of a man's attention. Above Reason, many things in
it confessedly are: but against Reason, I do not know of one. Meantime, is it not a glorious

[613] "It is a very misleading notion of Prophecy," says Dr. Arnold,--(a writer to whom, more
than to any other person, I conceive that we are indebted for "Essays and Reviews;" that unhappy
production being the lawful development and inevitable result of the late Head-master of Rugby's
most unsound and mischievous religious teaching:)--"It is a very misleading notion of Prophecy,
if we regard it as an anticipation of History." (Sermons, i. p. 375.) "I think that, with the
exception of those prophecies which relate to our LORD, the object of Prophecy is rather to
delineate principles and states of opinion which shall come, than external events. I grant
that Daniel seems to furnish an exception." (Life and Correspondence, p. 59.) This was written
in 1825. In 1840, we are informed:--"The latter chapters of Daniel, if genuine, would be a
clear exception to my Canon of Interpretation.... But I have long thought that the greater
part of the Book of Daniel is most certainly a very late work, of the time of the Maccabees;
and the pretended prophecy about the Kings of Grecia and Persia, and of the North and South,
is mere history, like the poetical prophecies in Virgil and elsewhere.... That there may be
genuine fragments in it, is very likely." (Ibid., p. 505.)--In other words, Dr. Arnold, rather
than suppose "my Canon of Interpretation" (!) worthless, is prepared to eject the Book of Daniel
from the Inspired Canon. Any thing is "very likely," in short, except that God could foretell
future events, and Dr. Arnold be in error!... Ἆρ' οὐχ ὕβρις τάδ';

[Bishop Horsley on the double sense of Prophecy.]

"I shall not wonder, if, to those who have not sifted this question to the bottom, (which few,
I am persuaded, have done,) the evidence of a Providence, arising from prophecies of this sort[647],
should appear to be very slender, or none at all. Nor shall I scruple to confess, that time
was when I was myself in this opinion, and was therefore much inclined to join with those who
think that every prophecy, were it rightly understood, would be found to carry a precise and
single meaning; and that, wherever the double sense appears, it is because the one true sense
hath not yet been detected. I said,--'Either the images of the prophetic style have constant
and proper relations to the events of the world, as the words of common speech have proper
and constant meanings, or they have not. If they have, then it seems no less difficult to conceive
that many events should be shadowed under the images of one and the same prophecy, than that
several likenesses should be expressed in a single portrait. But, if the prophetic images have
no such appropriate relations to things, but that the same image may stand for many things,
and various events be included in a single prediction, then it should seem that prophecy, thus
indefinite in its meaning, con afford no proof of Providence: for it should seem possible,
that a prophecy of this sort, by whatever principle the world were governed, whether by Providence,
Nature, or Necessity, might owe a seeming completion to mere accident.' And since it were absurd
to suppose that the Holy Spirit of GOD should frame prophecies by which the end of Prophecy
might so ill be answered, it seemed a just and fair conclusion, that no prophecy of holy writ
might carry a double meaning.

"Thus I reasoned, till a patient investigation of the subject brought me, by GOD'S blessing,
to a better mind. I stand clearly and unanswerably confuted, by the instance of Noah's prophecy
concerning the family of Japheth; which hath actually received various accomplishments, in
events of various kinds, in various ages of the world,--in the settlements of European and
Tartarian conquerors in the Lower Asia; in the settlements of European traders on the coasts
of India; and in the early and plentiful conversion of the families of Japheth's stock to the
faith of CHRIST. The application of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all the characteristics
of a true interpretation,--consistence with the terms of the prophecy, consistence with the
truth of history, consistence with the prophetic system. Every one of these events must therefore
pass, with every believer, for a true completion."

[Bishop Pearson on Theological Science.]

"Ad publicam Theologiæ professionem electus et constitutus sum; cujus cum præstantiam dignitatemque
considero, incredibili quadam dulcedine perfundit mirificeque delectat; cum amplitudinem difficultatemque
contemplor, perstringit oculos, percellit animum, abigit longe atque deterret.

"Cum Artes omnes Scientiæque Athenis diu floruissent, cum novam sedem Alexandriæ occuparent,
cum ingenia Romana toto terrarum orbe personarent, etiam tum dixit CHRISTUS ad Apostolos, Vos
estis lux mundi. Omnes aliæ Scientiæ, etiam cum maxime clarescerent, tenebris sunt involutæ,
et quasi nocte quadam sepultæ. Tum sol oritur, tum primum lumine perfundimur, cum DEI cognitione
illustramur; radii lucis non nisi de coelo feriunt oculos; cætera, quæ artes aut scientiæ nominantur,
non Athenæ sed noctuæ. Quid enim? nonne animis immortalibus præditi sumus, et ad æternitatem
natis? Quæ autem Philosophiæ pars perpetuitatem spirat? Quid Astronomicis observationibus fiet,
cum coeli ipsi colliquescent? Ubi se ostendet corporis humani peritus, et medicaminum scientia
præclarus, cum corruptio induet incorruptionem? Quæ Musicæ, quæ Rhetoricæ vires, cum Angelorum
choro et Archangelorum coetibus inseremur? Si nihil animus præsentiret in posterum, e coævis
sibi scientiis aliquid solatii carpere fas esset, secumque perituris delectari: sed in hoc
tam exiguo vitæ curriculo, et tam brevi, quid est, tam cito periturum, quod impleret animum,
in infinita sæculorum spatia duraturum? Sola Theologiæ principia, æternæ felicitatis certissima
expectatione foeta, auræ divinæ particulam, coelestis suæ originis consciam, et sempiternæ
beatitudinis candidatum, satiare possunt.

"Cætera Scientiæ exiguum aliquid de mundi opifice delibant, norunt; hæc, aquilæ invecta pennis,
coeli penetralia perrumpit, in ipsum Patrem luminum oculos intendit, et audaci veritate promittit,
DEUM nobis aliquando videndum sicut et nos videbimur.

"Quantum igitur moli corporis [anima materiæ expers,] quantum operosæ conjecturæ divina visio,
quantum brevi temporis spatio æternitas, quantum Parnasso Paradisus, tantum reliquis disciplinis
Theologia præferenda est.

"Sed hanc severam rebus humanis necessitatem imposuit DEUS, ut quæ pulcherrima sunt, sint et
difficillima. Si Sacrarum Literarum copiam, si studiorum theologicorum amplitudinem prospicias,
crederes promissionem divinam, sicut Ecclesiæ, ita doctrinæ terminos nullos posuisse.

"Scriptura ipsa, quam copiosa, quam intellectu difficilis! historiæ quam intricatæ! prophetiæ
quam obscuræ! præcepta quam multa! promissiones quam variæ! mysteria quam involuta! interpretes
quam infiniti! Linguæ, quibus exarata est, et nobis, et toti orbi terrarum peregrinæ. Tres
in titulo crucis consecratæ sunt; satis illæ erant, cum CHRISTUS moreretur; sed pluribus nobis
opus est ut intelligatur. Latina parum subsidii præbet, originibus exclusa. Græcæ magna est
utilitas, nec tamen illa, si pura, multum valet; nam aliam priorem semper aut reddit, aut imitatur.
Hebræa satis per se obscura, nec plene intelligenda, sine suis conterraneis, Chaldaica, Arabica,
Syriaca. Non est theologus, nisi qui et Mithridates!

"Jam hæc ipsa oracula Ecclesiæ DEI sunt commendata, ad illam a CHRISTO ipso amandamur; illa
testis, illa columna veritatis. Nec est unius aut ævi, aut regionis, Ecclesia DEI: per totum
terrarum orbem, quo disseminata, sequenda est; per Orientis vastissima spatia, per Occidentis
regna diversissima: antiquissimorum Patrum sententiæ percipiendæ, quorum libri pene innumeri
prodierunt, et nova tamen monumenta indies e tenebris eruuntur.

"Quid dicam Synodos, diversarum provinciarum foetus? quid Concilia, e toto orbe coacta, et
suprema auctoritate prædita? quid canonum decretorumque infinitam multitudinem? quorum sola
notitia insignem scientiam professionemque constituit; et tamen Theologiæ nostræ quantula particula
est?

"Quot hæreses in Ecclesia pullularunt, quarum nomina, natura, origines detegendæ: quæ schismata
inconsutilem CHRISTI tunicam lacerarunt; quo furore excitata, quibus modis suppressa, quibus
machinis sublata!

"Jam vero, scholasticorum quæstiones, quam innumera! Ad hæc omnia subtiliter disserenda, acute
disputanda, graviter determinanda, quanta Philosophiæ, quanta Dialecticæ necessitas! quæ leges
disputandi, quæ sophismatum strophæ detegendæ!

"The evidence of Religion not appearing obvious, may constitute one particular part of some
men's trial, in the religious sense: as it gives scope, for a virtuous exercise, or vicious
neglect of their understanding, in examining or not examining into that evidence. There seems
no possible reason to be given, why we may not be in a state of moral probation, with regard
to the exercise of our understanding upon the subject of Religion, as we are with regard to
our behaviour in common affairs. The former is as much a thing within our power and choice
as the latter."

       *       *       *       *       *

"Nor does there appear any absurdity in supposing, that the speculative difficulties, in which
the evidence of Religion is involved, may make even the principal part of some persons' trial.
Now when these latter persons have a distinct full conviction of the truth of Religion, without
any possible doubts or difficulties, the practice of it is to them unavoidable, unless they
will do a constant violence to their own minds; and religion is scarce any more a discipline
to them, than it is to creatures in a state of perfection. Yet these persons may possibly stand
in need of moral discipline and exercise in a higher degree, than they would have by such an
easy practice of religion. Or it may be requisite for reasons unknown to us, that they should
give some further manifestation what is their moral character, to the creation of GOD, than
such a practice of it would be. Thus in the great variety of religious situations in which
men are placed, what constitutes, what chiefly and peculiarly constitutes, the probation, in
all senses, of some persons, may be the difficulties in which the evidence of religion is involved:
and their principal and distinguished trial may be, how they will behave under and with respect
to these difficulties."--BISHOP BUTLER's Analogy, P. II. ch. vi. (ed. 1833,) p. 266. and pp. 274-5.

Further on, (p. 277,) Butler has the following note:--

"Dan. xii. 10. See also Is. xxix. 13, 14: St. Matth. vi. 23, and xi. 25, and xiii. 11, 12.
St. John iii. 19, and v. 44: 1 Cor. ii. 14, and 2 Cor. iv. 4: 2 Tim. iii. 13; and that affectionate
as well as authoritative admonition, so very many times inculcated, 'He that hath ears to hear
let him hear.' Grotius saw so strongly the thing intended in these and other passages of Scripture
of the like sense, as to say, that the proof given us of Christianity was less than it might
have been for this very purpose: 'Ut ita sermo Evangelii tanquam lapis esset Lydius ad quem
ingenia sanabilia explorarentur.' (De Verit. R. C. lib. ii. towards the end.)" If, here and
there, something like minuteness has been attempted[648], it has only been by way of sample
of what one would fain have done,--of what one would fain do,--time and place and occasion
serving. In the same spirit I will add a few remarks on the famous passage in Acts vii. 15,
16; for, confessedly, to a common eye it seems to contain several erroneous statements. The
words, as they stand in our English Bible, are these:--

"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our Fathers; and were carried over into Sychem,
and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father
of Sychem."

For obvious reasons, it will be convenient to have under our eyes, at the same time, the original
of the passage:--

Κατέβη δὲ Ἰακὼβ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν· καὶ μετετέθησαν εἰς
Συχὲμ, καὶ ἐτέθησαν ἐν τῷ μνήματι ὃ ὠνήσατο Ἀβραὰμ τιμῆς ἀργυρίου, παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἐμμὸρ τοῦ Συχέμ.

On this, Dr. Alford, Dean of Canterbury, delivers himself as follows:--

"There is certainly, and that not dependent upon any Rabbinical or Jewish views of the subject,
an inaccuracy in Stephen's statement: for the burying-place was not at Sychem which Abraham
bought, but at Hebron, and it was bought of Ephron the Hittite, as you will find in the 23rd
of Genesis from the 7th to the 20th verses. It is not worth while for us now to read the account,
but so it is: Abraham bought a field at Hebron of Ephron the Hittite. There is no mention at
all made of its being for a burying-place. But it was Jacob who bought a field near Shechem
'of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father.' These two incidents, then, in this case are confused
together. And again I say, if it is necessary to say it again, that there is no reason at all
for us to be ashamed of such a statement--no reason for us to be afraid of it, or in any way
staggered at it. It was not Stephen's purpose to give an accurate history of the children of
Israel, but to derive results from that history, which remain irrefragable, whatever the details
which he alleged."--Homilies on the former part of the Acts of the Apostles, by Henry Alford,
B.D., Dean of Canterbury, London, 1858, p. 219.

A northern Professor, (Patrick Fairbairn, D.D., Principal and Professor of Divinity in the
Free Church College, Glasgow,) also writes as follows:--

"Now, there can be no doubt, that viewing the matter critically and historically, there are
inaccuracies in this statement; for we know from the records of Old Testament history, that
Jacob's body was not laid in a sepulchre at Sychem, but in the cave of Machpelah at Hebron;--we
know also that the field, which was bought of the sons of Emmor, or the children of Hamor (as
they are called in Gen. xxxiii. 19), the father of Sichem, was bought, not by Abraham, but
by Jacob."--Hermeneutical Manual, or Introduction to the Exegetical Study of the Scriptures
of the New Testament, &c. Edinburgh, 1858, p. 101.

Now when it is considered that the speaker here was St. Stephen,--a man who is said to have
been "full of the HOLY GHOST," so that "no one could resist the wisdom and the spirit by which
he spake," (Acts vi. 3, 5, 8, 10.)--there is evidently the greatest primâ facie unreasonableness
in so handling his words. But let the adverse criticism be submitted to the test of a searching
analysis; and how transparently fallacious is it found to be!

First, we have to ascertain the meaning of the passage. And it is evident to every one having
an ordinary acquaintance with Greek, that the words Ἐμμὸρ τοῦ Συχὲμ cannot mean "Emmor the
father of Sychem." This is a mere mistranslation, as the invariable usage of the New Testament
shews. The genitive denotes dependent relation. The Vulgate rightly supplies the word "filii;"
and there can be no doubt whatever that what St. Stephen says, is, that Abraham bought the
burial-place "of the sons of Emmor, the son of Sychem."

Next, it is evident that "our Fathers," (οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν,) exclusive of Jacob, form the nominative
to the verb "were carried over" (μετετέθησαν.) In English, the place ought to be exhibited
as follows:--"he and our Fathers; and they were carried." But, in truth, the idiom of the original
is so easy, to one familiar with the manner of the sacred writers[649]; and the historical
fact so exceedingly obvious; that it must have been felt by St. Luke, in recording St. Stephen's
words, that greater minuteness of statement was quite needless. Who remembers not the affecting
details of where Jacob was to be buried, as well as the circumstantial narrative of whither
his sons conveyed his bones[650]? Who remembers not also that the bones of Joseph, (and, as
we learn from this place, the rest with him,) were carried up out of Egypt by the children
of Israel, at the Exode[651]?

Where then is the supposed difficulty? Moses relates (in Gen. xxiii.) that Abraham bought of
Ephron the Hittite, the son of Zohar, the field and the cave of Machpelah: and says that Machpelah
was before Mamre, otherwise called Kirjath-Arba, and Hebron. St. Stephen further relates that
Abraham bought the sepulchre at Sychem in which the Twelve Patriarchs were eventually buried,
of the sons of Emmor, (or Hamor.) May not the same man buy two estates?

True enough it is that Jacob, when he came from Padan Aram, "bought a parcel of a field" at
"Shalem a city of Shechem," "at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father." But there
is no pretence for saying that these last two transactions are identical, and have been here
confused together: for the sellers, in the one case, were "the sons of Emmor, the son of Sychem;"
and in the other, "the children of Hamor,"--father of that Shechem whose tragic end is related
in Gen. xxxiv.: while the buyer was in the one case, Abraham; in the other case, Jacob. Not
to be tedious however, let me in a few words, state what was the evident truth of the present
History.

It is found that Jacob, in order to build an altar at Shechem with security, judged it expedient
to purchase the field whereon it should stand. Who can doubt that the purchase was a measure
of necessity also? If, at the present day, one desired to erect a church on some spot in India,
where the value of land was fully ascertained[652], and where there were many inhabitants[653],--how
would it be possible to set about the work, with the remotest purpose of retaining possession,
unless one first bought the ground on which the structure was to stand? I infer that when Abraham
first halted at Sichem[654], and built an altar there[655], (the Canaanite being then in the
land,) it is very likely that he bought the ground also. But when St. Stephen informs me that
the thing which I think only probable, was a matter of fact; am I, (with Dean Alford,) to hesitate
about believing him? Abraham then, in the first instance, bought Sichem, Shechem, or Sychar;
and there built an altar. To that same spot, long after, his grandson Jacob resorted. What
wonder, since the wells of Abraham were stopped during his absence, and had to be recovered
by his son, (as related in Gen. xxvi. 17-22,)--what wonder, I say, if Jacob, on coming to Shechem
after an interval of nearly 200 years, finds that he also must renew the purchase of the cherished
possession? The importance of that locality, and the sacred interest attaching to it, has been
explained in a Plain Commentary on the Gospels, on St. John iv. 1-6, and 41. See also a Sermon
by the same author,--One Soweth and another Reapeth.

[The simplest view of Inspiration the truest and the best.]

"I suppose all thoughtful persons will allow that intellectual licentiousness is the danger
of this our intellectual age. For speculation indulges our pride. Faith is an inglorious thing;
any one can believe, a cottager just as well as a philosopher: but not all can speculate. The
privilege of an intellectually advanced person is that. And the more novel the view he offers,
the more evident the proof it gives of an independent mind. Therefore the danger of a highly
advanced state of society like our own, is Theory, as distinguished from Catholic Truth. And
the most inviting field of theory, is that high subject, the intercourse which hath gone on
between the Intellect above us, and our own; the communications which have been made from the
Creator to His creatures. In a word, man is under a temptation to frame a theory of Inspiration;
whether his attempts to frame one have been successful, is a matter of much interest to consider.

"I am going to offer a few plain remarks on what the Bible professes to be. I say, professes
to be, because those whom I speak to will believe that what it professes to be, it is. I mean
they will not suspect the writers of any dishonesty or ambitious pretence. But there may be
some readers of the Bible, among persons whose profession is the exercise of the intellect,
who are impatient at being left behind in the intellectual race; who, when continental critics
are going on into theories of inspiration, do not like the imputation (so freely cast upon
us by foreign writers) of being unequal to such things, of having no turn for philosophy. So
they must have a theory, or go along with one; they must receive the Bible,--for they do receive
it,--in some intellectual way; through some lens which they hold up; with a consciousness of
some intellectual action in receiving it, something which not every one could practise, something
beyond the mere simple apprehension of terms, and simple faith in embracing propositions.

"But in striking contrast with all such views and all such desires, stands the singular character
of the sacred volume itself. It manifestly addresses itself to a mind in an attitude of much
simplicity; to a mind coming to receive a theory, not to hold up one; coming to be shaped,
not holding out a mould to shape a communication made. For it presents itself as a document
containing a message from on high; as conveying the Word of GOD; nor can all that is ever said
on the subject get beyond this plain account of its contents, 'the Word of GOD.' Nor need any
one who desires to impress on his own mind and that of others the true character of the sacred
page, try to do more than to remind himself that it professes to convey to him the Word of
GOD."--Sermons by the Rev. C. P. Eden, pp. 148-150.

"What I desire to impress upon myself and those who hear me is this, that the words of GOD
are always perfect, always complete; and that the feeling with which a poor cottager sits down
to his Bible is the right one, and that the student hath the best hope of successful study
who in attitude of mind is most likened to him."--Ibid., p. 192.

"The conclusion, then, is this; that Faith hath not been wrong through these many years, in
her simple acceptance of GOD'S Word. To come round to simplicity, is what we have always had
to do in the great questions of Divinity. There have been great questions; they have agitated
the Church; but, as I said, to come round to simplicity hath ever been her work first or last.
When in the fourth century men refined upon the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and Arians and
semi-Arians would be telling us how these things could be, the unity of GOD in three Persons;
to come round to the simplicity of the Athanasian doctrine, and to disown the several explanatory
statements which, offering to explain, explained away, was the Church's work. I am not sure
that since the clays of the Arian dispute, a more important question has arisen than that which
seems likely to be ere long forcing itself upon us, of the Inspiration of Holy Writ. I freely
permit myself to anticipate that the simplest possible view of the subject, that on which rich
and poor may meet together, is the one to which we shall come round."--Ibid., pp. 172-3.

APPENDIX F.

(p. 107.)

[The written and the Incarnate Word.]

"I suppose we all have learned from the language used by the Evangelist St. John, always to
look on each of these two employments of the expression, (the WORD OF GOD,) with reference
to the other; and to see in each, the other also. I shall not attempt to express more definitely
this connexion; I only need to suppose that we all apprehend it as existing. But I shall claim
from it thus much to my present purpose;--that as He whom the Evangelist saw riding in the
heavenly pomp on high, and who was revealed to him as bearing this title, 'The WORD of GOD[656],'
was the same who rode as at this time into Jerusalem; in humiliation here, in glory there;
here veiled, there in brightness unveiled:--I would now associate the two, and would regard
that sacred volume which the poor cottager knows as the 'Word of GOD,' as placed under the
same dispensation; as veiled here, reserved for Revelation hereafter. I say, as all the other
circumstances of our condition are certainly to be regarded in this aspect, viz., as things
waiting for development; so ordered by a Divine wisdom as that they shall sustain faith and
instruct piety now, but shall shew themselves for what they are, (if ever to a created being,
yet) only in a later stage than that to which they were given as its present religious provision:
as other things, so the written page (I will assume) which speaks of GOD. I assume that in
this world we are using sounds which mean more than we know. I assume that in our churches
we are in the highest sense singing the songs of Sion, of the future and heavenly Sion. If
Saints in Heaven shall sing (as we are told they shall) the song of Moses, then the song of
Moses is already a song for Heaven; only there we shall know its meaning, or more of it than
now we do. And the use which I make of the reflection is, to suggest (as I said) the frame
of mind in which we should approach the consideration of the sacred page; such a frame of mind
as that no future revelations of the import of that page shall have power to reproach us as
having dishonoured it by our interpretations here, and having betrayed an inadequate feeling
of what Inspiration was."--Sermons, by the Rev. C. P. Eden, pp. 180-2.

(p. 112.)

[The volume of the Old Testament Scriptures, indivisible.]

"In regard of the Old Testament, it will be observed that the whole volume stands or falls
altogether. In whatever sense we understand the falling or standing, the volume stands or falls
together. Each page of it is committed to the credit of the rest, and the whole book or collection
of books is committed to the credit of each page. For this plain reason, that the book as we
have it, is the book which, being known in the Jewish Church as the volume of her authentic
and sacred Scriptures, our blessed SAVIOUR accepted and referred to as such. By whatever marks
the canonicity of the several books was in the first instance attested,--marks which were sufficient
for GOD'S purpose, and which did His work,--there is the volume. 'It is written,' said our
SAVIOUR; that is, in a book which all His nation knew of, and understood to be inspired. The
scrupulous care which the Jews shewed in preserving their sacred writings intact, is one of
the most remarkable facts in history; it is a fact of which the Christian student can give
perhaps the right account, seeing it to have been so ordered in the good providence of GOD,
that we might have firm ground in calling the book, as we have it, the Word of GOD. The volume
stands or falls then together; which we may with advantage bear in mind, because it makes an
argument which is available for any portion of the volume, available for the whole; and no
one can now say, 'You do not surely hold the genealogies in the books of Chronicles, to be
inspired: Isaiah and the Psalms may be inspired; but do you mean the same of the long extracts
from mere annals?' No man, I say, can take this freedom, until he can extract and remove those
chapters from the book which our blessed SAVIOUR unquestionably referred to as the canonical
Scriptures of the Church. If a verse stands, the Old Testament stands."--Sermons, by the Rev.
C. P. Eden, pp. 152-3.

APPENDIX I.

(p. 117.)

[Remarks on Theories of Inspiration.--The 'Human Element.']

"It will be allowed by all persons accustomed to a calm and charitable view of Theological
differences, that in those differences there is generally on each side some great truth wrongly
held, because taken out of its due place, and wrongly set. Applying this topic to the subject
before us, we are led to consider whether a mistake has not been made in bringing forward the
Human Element of Inspiration, instead of permitting the eye to rest upon that which GOD presents
to us,--the Divine. The Human Element no doubt is there; no doubt our Maker acts through our
faculties in every respect; no doubt He is acting through laws when He seems to suspend laws;
and even in Miracles, employs the powers of Nature instead of thwarting them; but then this
is His machinery, which He has not explained to us. He presents Himself to us, acting sometimes
supernaturally; i.e. in a way above nature as we understand nature. He made the Sun to stand
still for Joshua; what refractive cloud came in and held the daylight that it should not go
down is not made known to us; GOD said that it should stay, and it stayed; there was the miracle.
To have set the Creation going two thousand years before in such a way and train that in that
hour a cloud should rise to refract the sun's rays for a time, because in that hour the LORD's
armies would need the interference, the prolonging of the daylight,--that was miracle enough.
We say not that GOD interrupts His own laws; nay, rather we believe that He hath them always
in smooth and orderly operation. Similarly of Inspiration; we know not the way in which GOD
acts on human minds, the Spirit on the spirit; for He hath not told us. But, as I said in the
beginning, in an age like the present, where analysis of process is the work of men's minds,
the way in which man is feeling his strength in every direction, it is not very unnatural that
the operations of this philosophy should have been carried beyond their due line; into the
subject, namely, of the secret communication between the Divine Spirit, and the spirit and
apprehensions of Men, i.e. the Work of Inspiration. To accept the Bible as the word of GOD,
just as a cottager or a child in a village school accepts it, is an inglorious thing. He whose
intellect is his instrument, that which he is to work with, wishes to feel his intellect operating
on any subject which he has to meet. He feels a desire, in apprehending a thing as done, to
have as part of his apprehension, a view of how it is done, more or less. It is natural to
him to take what he feels to be an intelligent view of a subject. In accepting the Bible therefore
as the Word of GOD, he must have a view as to how it is the Word of GOD; the nature of the
illapse which the Spirit from on high makes on the spirit and faculties of the man. In a word,
he would get between the Creator, and man to whom the Creator speaks; and there would make
his observations. But how little encouragement have we to do this in the Word of GOD! When
GOD sent prophets to speak to men, to convey a message to them from their Maker, or when He
tells Apostles to speak to us, doth He invite us to come within the veil with our philosophy,
and examine? I shall offend the piety of those who hear me by pursuing the thought. But I cannot
but think that something of this kind has been done by those who have presented us with theories
of Inspiration, setting forth to us that which it cannot be shewn that GOD hath set forth to
them, or to any one. Yes, they are right; our Creator makes use of our faculties; and when
He hath given to one man faculties different from those given to another, faculties of whatever
kind, of intellectual power or of moral temperament, He employs them all. Hath He a message
of Love? He employs a St. John to utter it, and to prolong the delightful note. Hath He a message
of freedom, that liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made us free? He hath a Paul ready to accept
and to fulfil the congenial errand. But GOD speaks, not man; and they who would have us be
dwelling on the Human Element, when GOD invites us to be lost in the Divine, are doing not
well. Yes, GOD employs all our faculties: He hath made us different, as He made the flowers
of the field different, and Christianity shews us why He hath so made us; because He hath a
work for each of us to do,--a work which none else could do so well. Doubtless He employs all
our faculties, doing violence to none. This doubtless is His glory, that He can bring about
His results by the means which He Himself hath made. Who has not felt, in reading some sacred
narrative, the history, e.g. of Joseph, that the wonderful part of it was this, how naturally
all came about,--all by natural operation of human motives and man's free will? So in Inspiration.
No doubt GOD's instruments which He hath made are enough for His work; no doubt He employs
men as they are; not their tongues only, but their minds and spirits, acting on them and employing
them as they are. Only in that great process, the point which I call attention to is this,--GOD
speaks of it as divine, and fixes the thought of those who hear Him on the divine element:
we, dropping our view on the human, are not wise. He shews us providence; He condescends to
shew us His work: we do not well when we shew an interest rather in lower parts of the scheme,
especially when in those we may so greatly err, having so little information."--Sermons, by
the Rev. C. P. Eden, pp. 164-170.

APPENDIX J.

(p. 145.)

[How the Inspired authors of the New Testament handle the writings of the Inspired authors
of the Old.]

"Let me repeat:--The question is, how we should address ourselves to the study of the sacred
page? For example, how am I to regard, and how to deal with, the great diversities there are
between the several sacred writers? For there is the greatest diversity of mind appearing between
them. St. Paul is no more the same with St. John, than any two good men now are perfectly alike
in their constitution of mind. Nay, the diversity seems especially great in the case of the
sacred writers: as if to forbid us to adopt any theory which should ignore or neglect that
diversity. It is striking. How shall I deal with these and like circumstances?... Can it be
suggested to me what a good and wise man would do in this matter?

"In answer; it can apparently be suggested; and through that which is the best and safest of
arguments, the argument from analogy. For there has been a parallel case; the case of the inspired
writers of the New Testament dealing with the Scriptures of the Old. To this parallel I now
invite your attention. If we can observe how and upon what great principles, piety and wisdom,
guided by Inspiration, dealt with the volume of the Holy Scriptures which were then its whole
volume, namely the Old Testament; we have so far forth a parallel case to the case of Christians
now. The first Christians looked back on the Old Testament as their sacred Scriptures. If we
can discern how they regarded their sacred volume, and how they proceeded in interpreting it,
we have a pattern to guide us in regard of the question, how we shall regard the sacred volume,
and how proceed in the study and interpretation of it; they with the Bible that they had,--we
with the Bible that we have, the completed volume.--In this point of view I cannot but regard
it as most distinctly providential that there are introduced in the pages of the New Testament
so many quotations from the pages of the Old. For they furnish us with an answer applicable
in every age of the Church to the question, How shall piety and wisdom deal with a sacred volume;
that volume being from the pen of many writers; but with this aggravated difficulty in the
former case, that the writers there were widely separated from one another in point of time,
were in contact therefore with most difficult forms of life and stages of society? How in approaching
a volume so originated, did the New Testament writers regard and deal with its contents?"--Sermons,
by the Rev. C. P. Eden, pp. 183-5.

"And it is impossible for us to imagine,--I say the thoughtful reader of the Holy Scriptures
will find it impossible to imagine,--an Evangelist or Apostle, evoking out of its grave the
Human Element of the ancient prophetic communications; disinterring it once more as if to gaze
upon it. I am sure the impression left on the mind by the passages in the New Testament where
the Old is referred to, is in accordance with what I say. In other words,--(for it is but in
other words the same,)--these divinely instructed students,--these inspired readers of the
sacred page,--are aware of that which they read, being inspired; GOD its author, and not Man.
And they shew this consciousness, putting off their shoes from their feet, as if on holy ground.
A divinely instructed mind, interprets a divinely indited Scripture; the Spirit His own interpreter;
and we are taught,--not by man but by the Author of Inspiration,--how Inspiration is to be
dealt with.--Let him who would deal aright with the sacred pages of the New Covenant, observe
in due seriousness what instruction he may gain from the consideration now suggested to his
thoughts. Let him learn from the sacred page, how to deal with the sacred page. And if he has
observed these things; if he has seen how the writers of the New Testament, discern in lines
and words of the Old Testament, that which speaks to them,--(for it speaks to CHRIST, and in
Him to His Church, i.e. to them:) ... how these utterers of inspired sounds are found, when
their words receive at length an authentic interpretation, to have been speaking of the Christian
Church, its terms of Salvation, its spiritual gifts;--a reader of the Holy Scriptures practised
in these observations will have learned in some measure how to approach the sacred volume;
with a sense not only of its unfathomed depth, but also of its unity of scope; and a conscious
interest rather in its universal truths,--its ever present truths,--than in those transitory
imports which some of its pages can be shewn to have had, over and above their Evangelical
meaning."--(Ibid., pp. 186-9.)

[Bishop Bull on Deut. xxx.]

"Jam hic etiam quæstionem unam et alteram solvendam exhibebimus.--Quæritur, An nullum omnino
extet in lege Mosis SPIRITUS SANCTI promissum? Resp. Legem, si per eam intelligas pactum in
monte Sinai factum, et mediatore Mose populo Israelitico datum, (quæ, ut modo diximus, est
maxime propria ac genuina ipsius in Paulinis Epistolis notio atque acceptio,) nullum Spiritus
Sancti promissum continere, manifestum est. Si, inquam, per eam intelligas pactum in Sinai
factum; quia in hagiographis et Scriptis Propheticis, (quæ nomine legis et Veteris Test. laxius
sumpto non raro veniunt,) de SPIRITU SANCTO, tum ex gratiâ Divinâ promisso, tum precibus hominum
impetrato, passim legimus. Imo et in Mosaicis scriptis, licet non in ipso Mosaico foedere,
promissum (ni fallor) satis clarum de gratia SPIRITUS SANCTI Israelitis a DEO danda reperire est.

"Ejusmodi certe est illud Deut. xxx. 6: 'Circumcidet JEHOVA DEUS tuus animam tuam et animam
seminis tui, ad diligendum Jehovam Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo,' &c. Etenim circumcisionem
cordis, præsertim ejusmodi quâ ad DEUM toto corde diligendum homines præparentur, non sine
magna SPIRITUS SANCTI vi atque efficacia fieri posse, apud omnes, qui a Pelagio diversum sentiunt,
in confesso est. Sed hoc etiam ad Evangelicam Justitiam pertinebat, quam sub cortice externorum
rituum et ceremoniarum latitantem primum Moses ipse, dein prophetæ alii, digito quasi commonstrarunt.
Justitia enim Fidei, quæ in evangelio πεφανέρωται olim erat ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν
μαρτυρουμένη,--ut diserte affirmat Apostolus. (Rom. iii. 21.) Dixi autem, exerte hanc SPIRITUS
SANCTI promissionem in ipso Mosaico foedere non haberi. Addam aliquid amplius,--partem eam
fuisse Novi Testamenti, ab ipso Mose promulgati. Nam foedus cum Judæis sancitum, (Deut. xxix.,
et seq., in quo hæc verba reperiuntur,) plane diversum fuisse a foedere in monto Sinai facto,
adeoque renovationem continuisse pacti cum Abrahamo initi, h. e. foederis Evangelici tum temporis
obscurius revelati,--multis argumentis demonstrari potest. (1º) Diserte dicitur, (cap. xxix.
1.) verba, quæ ibidem sequuntur, fuisse 'verba foederis quod DEUS præcepit Mosi, ut pangeret
cum Israelitis, præter foedus illud, quod pepigerat cum illis in Chorebo.' Qui renovationem
tantum hic intelligunt foederis in monte Sinai facti, nugas agunt, quin et textûs ipsius apertissimis
verbis contradicunt. Neque enim verba foederis in Sinai facti repetita ac renovata ullo sensu
dici possunt verba foederis, quod DEUS sancivit præter illud, quod in monte Sinai pepigerat.
(2º) Diserte dicitur, hoc foedus idem prorsus fuisse cum eo, quod DEUS juramento sanciverat
cum Israelitici populi majoribus, Abrahamo puta, Isaaco et Jacobo, (ejusdem cap. ver. 12, 13,)--quod
foedus ipsum Evangelicum fuit, obscurius revelatum, ipso apostolo Paulo interprete, Gal. iii.
16, 17. (3º) Nonnulla hujus foederis verba citat Paulus, ut verba foederis Evangelici, quæ
fidei justitiam manifesto præ se ferant. (Vide Rom. x. 6. et seq. Coll. Deut. xxx. 11, et seq.)
Haud me fugit esse nonnullos, qui statuunt, hæc Mosis verba ab Apostolo ad fidei justitiam
per allusionem tantum accommodari: sed fidem non faciunt, cum Paulus verba ista manifesto alleget
ut ipsissima verba justitiæ fidei, h. e. foederis Evangelici, in quo justitia ista revelatur.
Sed non necesse erat, hoc saltem in loco, ut tali κρησφυγέτῳ uterentur. Nam, (4º) quæcunque
in hoc foedere continentur, in Evangelium mire quadrant. (i.) Quod ad præcepta attinet, præscribuntur
hic ea tantum, quæ ad mores pertinent, et per se honesta sunt; illorum rituum, qui, si verba
spectes, pueriles videri possent, quorumque totum foedus legale fere plenum est, nulla facta
mentione. Addas, totam illam obedientiam, quæ hic requiritur, ad sincerum sedulumque studium
Deo in omnibus obediendi referri. (Vid. cap. xxx., 10, 16, 20.) (ii.) Ad promissa quod spectat,
plenam hic omnium peccatorum, etiam gravissimorum, remissionem post peractam poenitentiam repromittit
DEUS; (cap. xxx., 1-4.) quæ gratia in foedere legali nuspiam concessa est, ut supra fusius
ostendimus. Deinde, gratia SPIRITUS SANCTI, qua corda hominum circumcidantur, ut JEHOVAM diligant
ex toto corde atque ex tota anima, hoc in loco, de quo agimus, (nempe prædicti capitis ver
6.) clare promittitur. Hui! quam procul ab usitata Mosaicorum scriptorum vena!... (5º) Foedus
illud, de quo prædixit Jeremias, (xxxi. 31. et seq.) foedus esse Evangelicum, negavit Christianus
nemo; cum Divinus auctor Epistolæ ad Hebræos idipsum expresse doceat, (viii. 8, et seq.) Jam
quæ de pacto isto prænuntiat propheta, omnia huic foederi Moabitico ad amussim respondent.
Appellat suum foedus Jeremias 'foedus novum; ab eo, quod cum majoribus populi Israelitici Ægypto
exeuntibus pepigerat DEUS, omnino diversum.' Idem etiam de Moabitico foedere dicit Moses. Causam
reddit Jeremias cur novum DEUS pactum, Sinaiticum aboliturus, molitus fuerit; nempe, quod Israelitæ,
præpotentiore gratia destituti, Sinaiticum illud irritum fecissent, præceptis ejusdem non obtemperando,
(ver. 32.) Eandem causam et Moses manifesto designat; 'Nondum,' inquit, 'dederat vobis JEHOVA
mentem ad cognoscendum, et oculos ad videndum, et aures ad audiendum, usque ad diem hunc:'
(Deut. xxix. 4.) h. d. Pactum prius vobiscum pepigerat DEUS, in quo voluntatem suam præceptis,
tum promissis tum minis, tum denique miraculis omne genus satis superque communitis, vobis
ipsis patefecerat. Sed vidit foedus illud parum vobis profuisse; vidit vobis opus esse efficaciore
adhuc gratia, qua nempe corda vestra circumcidantur, &c. ideoque novum foedus meditatur, in
quo gratiam illam efficacissimam vobis adstipulaturus sit. Eandem autem cordis circumcisionem
procul dubio designant verba Jeremiæ, v. 33, præd. cap.; 'Indam legem meam menti eorum, et
cordi eorum inscribam eam.' Porro remissio ista omnium peccatorum, quæ poenitentibus promittitur
a Mose, (Deut. xxx. 1. et seq.) a Jeremiâ etiam clare exprimitur prædicti cap. ver 34. 'Ero
propitius iniquitatibus eorum, et peccatorum ipsorum et transgressionum ipsorum non recordabor
amplius.' Denique Jeremias claritatem ostendit adeoque facilitatem præceptorum, quæ in novo
suo foedere continebantur, ob quam Dei populo non opus esset laboriosa disquisitione, aut exactiori
disciplina, ut præcepta istius foederis cognoscerent implerentque, (Ejusdem capitis, ver. 34.)
Idem Mosen quoque voluisse manifestum erit, (si verba ejus Deut. xxx. 11, et seq. cum iis,
quæ Apostolus ad eundem locum disserit Rom. x. 6, et seq. accuratius perpenderis.) Mihi certe
clara videntur omnia. (6º) Ac postremo, ut res hæc tota extra omnem controversiæ aleam ponatur,
ipsi Hebræorum magistri ea, quæ Deut. xxix. et deinceps continentur, ad Messiæ tempus omnino
referenda censuerunt. Testem advoco fide dignissimum P. Fagium, qui (ad Deut. xxx. 6.

"In his ideo prolixius immorati sumus, tum, ut vel hinc manifestum fieret, omnia, quæ in Mosaicis
scriptis continentur, ad foedus Mosaicum, proprie sic dictum, nequaquam pertinere; adeoque
quam vera ac prorsus necessaria sit distinctio Augustini, (de qua aliquoties jam dictum est,)
legem veterem κυρίως sumptam ad solum pactum in monte Sinai factum restringentis; tum imprimis
ut exinde etiam clare eluceret optima ac sapientissima DEI οἰκονομία, quam in dispensando gratiæ
suæ foedere usurpare visum ipsi fuerit. Pepigerat DEUS cum Abrahamo foedus illud gratiosum
multis ante latam legem annis; cui postea placuit ipsi superaddere pactum aliud, multis, iisque
operosis, ritibus ac ceremoniis conflatum, quibus rudem et carnalem Abrahami posteritatem,
recens ex Ægypto eductam, adeoque paganicis ritibus ac superstitionibus nimis addictam, in
officio contineret, i.e. ab ethnicorum idololatrico cultu arceret. Quod optime expressit Tertullianus
(adversus Marcion. 2.) his verbis: 'Sacrificiorum onera, et operationum et oblationum negotiosas
scrupulositates nemo rcprehendat, quasi DEUS talia proprie sibi desideraverit, qui tam manifeste
exclamat, "Quo mihi multitudinem sacrificiorum vestrorum?" et, "Quis exquisivit ista de manibus
vestris?" sed illam DEI industriam sentiat, qua populum pronum in idololatriam et transgressionem
ejusmodi officiis religioni suæ voluit adstringere, quibus superstitio sæculi agebatur, ut
ab ea avocaret illos, sibi jubens fieri quasi desideranti, ne simulacris faciendis delinqueret.'
(Conf. Gal. iii. 19.) Sed prævidens sapientissimus DEUS, fore, ut hoc ipsius propositum populus
obtusi pectoris non intelligeret, post latam istam carnalem legem, præcepit Mosi, ut Israelitis
novum foedus promulgaret, seu potius ut vetus illud, cum Abrahamo ante multos annos initum,
(quod spiritualem imprimis justitiam exigebat, et gratia ac misericordia plenum erat,) renovaret:
ut hinc tandem cognoscerent Judæi, pactum Abrahamiticum etiam post latam legem ritualem adhuc
viguisse, adeoque pro foedere habendum fuisse, cui unice salus ipsorum inniteretur. (Conf.
Gal. iii. 17.) ... Quis hic cum Apostolo non exclamet, Ὦ βάθος πλούτου καὶ σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως
Θεοῦ! (Rom. xi. 33.) Sed hæc obiter, etsi haudquaquam frustra. Pergo."--From Bp. Bull's Harmonia

[Opinions of Commentators concerning Accommodation.]

Cornelius à Lapide, on this place, writes us follows:--"Licet Cajetanus, Adamus, Pererius,
Toletus, putent Mosem ad litteram loqui de Christo et Christi justitiâ, referunt enim hæc ejus
verba ad poenitentiam, de qua eodem capite egerat Moses, ver. 1; (Poenitentia enim et dilectio
Dei, ac consequenter peccatorum venia, ipsaque justitia sine fide Christi haberi non potest;)
tamen longe planius est, ut non litteraliter, sed allegorice tantum alludat Apostolus ad Mosem.
Moses enim ad litteram, sive in sensu litterati loquitur, non de Christo ejusque Evangelio,
sed de lege data Judæis, ut patet eum intuenti. Ita Chrysostomus, Theodoretus, Theophylactus,
Oecumenius, Abulensis, Soto.... Hæc, inquam verba, Mosem ad suos Judæos literaliter loqui planè
certum, evidens, et manifestum est; ita tamen ut eadem hæc ejus verba allegorice Evangelio
ejusque catechumenis et fidelibus optime conveniant. Æque enim, immo magis, ad manum est omnibus
jam Evangelium et fides Christi, quam olim fuerit lex Mosis: ita ut fidem hanc omnes facillime
corde, id est mente, complecti: et ore proloqui, itaque justificari et salvari possint."

Our own learned Hammond writes as follows:--"The two phrases of 'going up into Heaven,' or
'descending into the deep,' are proverbial phrases to signify the doing or attempting to do
some hard, impossible thing.... These phrases had been of old used by Moses in this sense,
Deut. xxx. 12." [And then, the place follows.] "Which words being used by Moses to express
the easiness and readiness of the way which the Jews had to know their duty and to perform
it, are here by the Apostle accommodated to express the easiness of the Gospel condition, above
that of the Mosaical Law."--So far Dr. Hammond; whose notion that there was any accommodation
here, I altogether deny. As for his belief that the paraphrase in the Targum of Jerusalem,
["Utinam esset nobis aliquis Propheta, Jonæ similis, qui in profundum maris magni descenderet,"]
is the "ground of St. Paul's application" of the place to the Death and Resurrection of Christ,
I can but feel surprised to find such a view advocated by so learned a man, and so excellent
a Divine. But it is not Hammond's way to write thus. In his "Practical Catechism," he often
expounds similar Scripture, (e.g. St. Luke i. 72-5,) after a very lofty fashion.

Again:--"Hunc locum accommodavit ad causam suam B. Paulus, Rom. x. Nam cum proprie hic locus
pertineat ad Decalogum, transfertur eleganter et erudite a Paulo ad fidem quæ os requirit ut
promulgetur, et cor ut corde credamus."--Fagius, ad Deut. xxx. 11, apud Criticos Sacros.

Occasionally, however, we meet with a directly different gloss:--

"Locum hunc divinus Paulus divine de Evangelica prædicatione ac sermone fidei est interpretatus,
tametsi sensum magis, ut æquum est, quam textum ad verbum expresserit; ut illius etiam alibi
est mos. Satis enim fuit, atque adeo magis consentaneum viris Spiritu Dei plenis significare
quid idem Spiritus in Scriptura intelligi vellet."--Clavius, ad Deut. xxx. 14, apud Criticos
Sacros.

Concerning the general principle of Accommodation, (as explained above, p. 188,) the following
passages present themselves as valuable.

"Men have suggested that these things were accommodations of the Sacred Writers; and that the
New Testament Writers, in the interpretations they gave of passages in the Old, meant to say,
that the texts might be applied in such way as they applied them. But the suggestors of this
view can hardly have considered carefully those conversations of our Blessed SAVIOUR with His
disciples going to Emmaus; and afterward in the evening of the same day, in which He distinctly
reprehends them for their dulness of heart in not seeing in the pages of the Old Testament
the predictions of His Death and of His Resurrection; though, of His Resurrection the intimations
are, in those ancient Scriptures, to our view so scanty and obscure. He unfolds to them as
they walk the reference of the Old Testament Scriptures to Himself. Then in a later interview
He resumes the instruction and 'opens their understanding,' (it is said,) to discover the same;
the relation of the Old Testament Scriptures (namely) to Himself.--He is a bold Commentator
who having seen the Disciples thus instructed,--having witnessed this scene,--then, when he
meets with these same Disciples' interpretations of the ancient Scriptures in relation to CHRIST,
calls them 'Accommodations,' and gives them to a human original. But I ask leave to turn from
this theory."--Sermons by the Rev. C. P. Eden, pp. 189--190.

"If we believe that the Apostles were inspired, then all idea of accommodation must be renounced....
The theory of Accommodation, i.e. of erroneous interpretation of the Scripture, cannot be thought
of without imputing error to the SPIRIT of Truth and Holiness; or to Him who sent the SPIRIT
to recal to the minds of the Apostles all things which He had said to them, and to guide them
into all Truth."--From a Sermon by Dr. M'Caul, The Hope of the Gospel the Hope of the Old Testament
Saints, (1854,)--p. 8.

   $...$ respectively. Where Greek letters were used for enumeration,
   they are represented by =1=, =2=, =3= for the original alpha, beta,
   gamma etc. Increased letter-spacing in Greek (used for emphasis) has

 * Footnotes have been renumbered to run from 1 through the book. Where
   there is reference to a particular footnote in the text, the original
   text has been left, but [our 330] inserted to advise what the reference
   now is.
 * The author's unusual punctuation style has been preserved, notably in
   the following respects.
   * Footnote markers appear before punctuation.
   * Punctuation appears before closing parentheses.
   * When a quotation is followed by a page reference, the page reference
     is normally followed by the same punctuation as the quotation ended
     with.
 * The use of hyphenation in the book was inconsistent. Where words were
   hyphenated at the end of a line, other examples in the text have been
   followed. Cases where there was some doubt were "pre-existing" (p. li),
    "co-extensive" (p. lxxvi), "frostwork" (p. cxxii), "overrule" (p. 20),
    and "twofold" (p. 38).
 * Roman numerals used for punctuation are sometimes followed by a period,
   sometimes not.
 * i.e., and e.g., have been standardised to have no space.
 * The following words are either archaic spellings or typographical
   errors and have been left as in the original. Those known to the
   transcriber as valid archaic spellings have been marked [*]
   * "Pourtrays/pourtrayed" (p. xxv),
   * "recal" for "recall" (p. xxviii and others)
   * "inuendo" (p. liv) [*]
   * "præ-Adamic" (p. cvii)
