HENRIE THE FOURTH,

Cousine Germane to Richard the Second, latelie depriued.

When king Richard had resigned (as before is specified) the scepter and crowne; Henrie Plantagenet
borne at Bullingbroke in the countie of Lincolne, duke of Lancaster and Hereford, earle of
Derbie, Leicester, and Lincolne, sonne to Iohn of Gant duke of Lancaster, with generall consent
both of the lords & commons, was published, proclamed, and declared king of England and of
France, and lord of Ireland, the last daie of September, in the yeare of the world 5366, of
our Lord 1399, of the reigne of the emperour Wenceslaus the two and twentith, of Charles the
first king of France the twentith, and the tenth of Robert the third king of Scots. After that
king Richard had surrendered his title, and dispossessed himselfe (which Chr. Okl. noteth in
few words, saieing;

  ------------post breue tempus
  Exuit insigni sese diademate, sceptrum
  Henrico Lancastrensi regale relinquens)

[Sidenote: In Angl. prælijs.] [Sidenote: New officers made.] king Henrie made certeine new
officers. And first in right of his earledome of Leicester he gaue the office of high steward
of England (belonging to the same earledome) vnto his second sonne the lord Thomas, who by
his fathers commandement exercised that office, being assisted (by reason of his tender age)
by Thomas Persie earle of Worcester. The earle of Northumberland was made constable of England:
sir Iohn Scirlie lord chancellor, Iohn Norburie esquier lord treasurer, sir Richard Clifford
lord priuie seale. [Sidenote: The parlemēt new sūmoned.] Forsomuch as by king Richards resignation
and the admitting of a new king, all plées in euerie court and place were ceased, and without
daie discontinued, new writs were made for summoning of the parlement vnder the name of king
Henrie the fourth, the same to be holden, as before was appointed, on mondaie next insuing.
[Sidenote: Record Turris.] Vpon the fourth day of October, the lord Thomas second sonne to
the king sat as lord high steward of England by the kings commandement in the White-hall of
the kings palace at Westminster, and as belonged to his office, he caused inquirie to be made
what offices were to be exercised by anie maner of persons the daie of the kings coronation,
and what fées were belonging to the same, causing proclamation to be made, that what noble
man or other that could claime anie office that daie of the solemnizing the kings coronation,
[Sidenote: Claiming of offices at the coronation.] they should come and put in their bils cōprehending
their demands. Whervpon diuers offices & fees were claimed, as well by bils as otherwise by
spéech of mouth, in forme as here insueth.

First, the lord Henrie, the kings eldest sonne, to whome he as in right of his duchie of Lancaster
had appointed that office, claimed to beare before the king the principall sword called Curtana,
[Sidenote: Curtana. The earle of Summerset.] and had his sute granted. Iohn erle of Summerset,
to whom the king as in right of his earledome of Lincolne, [Sidenote: The earle of Northumberland.]
had granted to be caruer the daie of his coronation, and had it confirmed. Henrie Persie earle
of Northumberland, and high constable of England, by the kings grant claimed that office, [Sidenote:
The Ile of Man.] and obteined it to inioy at pleasure. The same earle in right of the Ile of
Man, which at that present was granted to him, and to his heires by the king, claimed to beare
on the kings left side a naked sword, with which the king was girded, [Sidenote: Lancaster
sword.] when before his coronation he entered as duke of Lancaster into the parts of Holdernesse,
[Sidenote: The earl of Westmerland.] which sword was called Lancasters sword. Rafe erle of
Westmerland, and earle marshall of England, by the kings grant claimed the same office, [Sidenote:
The duke of Norffolke.] and obteined it, notwithstanding that the attornies of the duke of
Norfolke, presented to the lord steward their petition on the dukes behalfe, as earle marshall,
to exercise the same. [Sidenote: Sir Thomas Erpingham.] Sir Thomas Erpingham knight exercised
the office of lord great Chamberleine, and gaue water to the king when he washed, both before
and after dinner, hauing for his fées, the bason, ewer, and towels, with other things whatsoeuer
belonging to his office: notwithstanding Auberie de Veer earle of Orenford put in his petitions
to haue that office as due vnto him from his ancestors. [Sidenote: The earle of Warwike.] Thomas
Beauchampe earle of Warwike by right of inheritance, bare the third sword before the king,
and by like right was pantler at the coronation. [Sidenote: Sir William Argentine.] Sir William
Argentine knight, by reason of the tenure of his manour of Wilmundale in the countie of Hertford,
serued the king of the first cup of drinke which he tasted of at his dinner the daie of his
coronation: the cup was of siluer vngilt, which the same knight had for his fées: notwithstanding
the petition which Iuon Fitzwarren presented to the lord steward, [Sidenote: Iuon Fitzwarren.]
requiring that office in right of his wife the ladie Maud, daughter and heire to sir Iohn Argentine
knight. [Sidenote: The lord Furniuall.] Sir Thomas Neuill lord Furniuall, by reason of his
manour of Ferneham, with the hamlet of Cere, which he held by the courtesie of England after
the decesse of his wife, the ladie Ione decessed, gaue to the king a gloue for his right hand,
and susteined the kings right arme so long as he bare the scepter.

[Sidenote: The lord Graie.] The lord Reginald Graie of Ruthen, by reason of his manour of Ashleie
in Norfolke couered the tables, and had for his fees all the tableclothes, as well those in
the hall, as else-where, when they were taken vp; notwithstanding a petition exhibited by sir
Iohn Draiton to haue had that office. [Sidenote: Great spurs.] The same lord Graie of Ruthen,
bare the kings great spurs before him in the time of his coronation by right of inheritance,
as heire to Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke. [Sidenote: The second sword.] Iohn erle of Summerset,
by the kings assignement bare the second sword before him at his coronation, albeit that the
said lord Graie of Ruthen by petition exhibited before the lord steward demanded the same office,
by reason of his castell & tower of Penbroke, and of his towne of Denbigh. [Sidenote: The earle
of Arundell.] Thomas earle of Arundell cheefe butler of England, obteined to exercise that
office the daie of the coronation, and had the fées thereto belonging granted to him, to wit,
the goblet with which the king was serued, and other things to that his office apperteining
(the vessels of wine excepted) that laie vnder the bar, which were adiudged vnto the said lord
steward, the said earle of Arundels claime notwithstanding.

[Sidenote: The citizens of London.] The citizens of London chosen foorth by the citie, serued
in the hall, as assistants to the lord cheefe butler, whilest the king sate at dinner, the
daie of his coronation: and when the king entered into his chamber after dinner, and called
for wine, the lord maior of London brought to him a cup of gold with wine, and had the same
cup given to him, togither with the cup that conteined water to allay the wine. After the king
had drunke, the said lord maior and the aldermen of London had their table to dine at, [Sidenote:
Thomas Dimocke.] on the left hand of the king in the hall. Thomas Dimocke, in right of his
moother Margaret Dimocke, by reason of the tenure of his manor of Scriuelbie, claimed to be
the kings champion at his coronation, and had his sute granted; notwithstanding a claime exhibited
by Baldwin Freuill, demanding that office by reason of his castell of Tamworth in Warwikeshire.
[Sidenote: Baldwin Freuill.] The said Dimocke had for his fees one of the best coursers in
the kings stable, with the kings saddle and all the trappers & harnesse apperteining to the
same horsse or courser: he had likewise one of the best armors that was in the kings armorie
for his owne bodie, with all that belonged wholie therevnto.

[Sidenote: The lord Latimer.] Iohn lord Latimer, although he was vnder age, for himselfe and
the duke of Norfolke, notwithstanding that his possessions were in the kings hands, by his
atturnie sir Thomas Graie knight, claimed and had the office of almoner for that daie, by reason
of certeine lands which sometime belonged to the lord William Beuchampe of Bedford. They had
a towell of fine linnen cloth prepared, to put in the siluer that was appointed to be giuen
in almes; and likewise they had the distribution of the cloth that couered the pauement and
floors from the kings chamber doore, vnto the place in the church of Westminster where the
pulpit stood. [Sidenote: William le Venour.] The residue that was spread in the church, the
sexten had. William le Venour, by reason he was tenant of the manor of Listen, claimed and
obteined to exercise the office of making wafers for the king the daie of his coronation. [Sidenote:
The barons of the cinque ports.] The barons of the fiue ports claimed, and it was granted them,
to beare a canopie of cloth of gold ouer the K. with foure staues, & foure bels at the foure
corners, euerie staffe hauing foure of those barons to beare it: also to dine and sit at the
table next to the king on his right hand in the hall the daie of his coronation, and for their
fees to haue the forsaid canopie of gold, with the bels and staues, notwithstanding the abbat
of Westminster claimed the same. Edmund Chambers claimed and obteined the office of principall
larderer for him and his deputies, by reason of his manour of Skulton, otherwise called Burdellebin
Skulton, in the countie of Norfolke. Thus was euerie man appointed to exercise such office
as to him of right apperteined, or at the least was thought requisit for the time present.
On mondaie then next insuing, when the states were assembled in parlement, order was taken,
that by reason of such preparation as was to be made for the coronation, they should sit no
more till the morow after saint Edwards daie. On the sundaie following, being the euen of saint
Edward, [Sidenote: Knights of the Bath.] the new king lodged in the Tower, and there made fortie
& six knights of the Bath, to wit: thrée of his sonnes, the earle of Arundell, the earle of
Warwike his sonne, the earle of Stafford, two of the earle of Deuonshires sonnes, the lord
Beaumont, the lord Willoughbies brother, the earle of Staffords brother, the lord Camois his
sonne, the lord of Maule, Thomas Beauchampe, Thomas Pelham, Iohn Luttrell, Iohn Lisleie, William
Haukeford iustice, William Brinchleie iustice, Bartholomew Rathford, Giles Daubenie, William
Butler, Iohn Ashton, Richard Sanape, Iohn Tiptost, Richard Francis, Henrie Persie, Iohn Arundell,
William Strall, Iohn Turpington, Ailmer Saint, Edward Hastings, Iohn Greisleie, Gerald Satill,
Iohn Arden, Robert Chalons, Thomas Dimocke, Hungerford, Gibethorpe, Newport, and diuerse other,
to the number of fortie and six.

[Sidenote: The lord maior of London.] On the morow being saint Edwards daie, and the thirteenth
of October, the lord maior of London rode towards the Tower to attend the king, with diuerse
worshipfull citizens clothed all in red, and from the Tower the king rode through the citie
to Westminster, where he was consecrated, anointed, and crowned king by the archbishop of Canturburie
with all ceremonies and roiall solemnitie as was due and requisit. [Sidenote: The earle of
March enuied the K. preferment.] Though all other reioised at his aduancement, yet suerlie
Edmund Mortimer earle of March, which was coosine and heire to Lionell duke of Clarence, the
third begotten sonne of king Edward the third, & Richard earle of Cambridge, sonne to Edmund
duke of Yorke, which had married Anne sister to the same Edmund, were with these dooings neither
pleased nor contented: insomuch that now the diuision once begun, the one linage ceassed not
to persecute the other, till the heires males of both the lines were cléerlie destroied and
extinguished.

At the daie of the coronation, to the end he should not séeme to take vpon him the crowne and
scepter roiall by plaine extorted power, [Sidenote: Edmund erle of Lancaster vntrullie feined
to be surnamed Crookebacke.] and iniurious intrusion: he was aduised to make his title as heire
to Edmund (surnamed or vntrulie feined) Crookebacke, sonne to king Henrie the third, and to
saie that the said Edmund was elder brother to king Edward the first, and for his deformitie
put by from the crowne, to whom by his mother Blanch, daughter and sole heire to Henrie duke
of Lancaster, he was next of blood, and undoubted heire. But because not onelie his fréends,
but also his priuie enimies, knew that this was but a forged title, considering they were suerlie
informed, not onelie that the said Edmund was yoonger sonne to king Henrie the third, but also
had true knowledge, that Edmund was neither crooke backed, nor a deformed person, but a goodlie
gentleman, and a valiant capteine, and so much fauored of his louing father, that he to preferre
him in marriage to the queene Dowager of Nauarre, hauing a great liuelihood, gaue to him the
countie palantine of Lancaster, with manie notable honours, high segniories, and large priuileges.
Therefore they aduised him to publish it, that he challenged the realme not onelie by conquest,
but also because he by king Richard was adopted as heire, and declared by resignation as his
lawfull successor, being next heire male to him of the blood roiall.

But to procéed to other dooings. The solemnitie of the coronation being ended, the morow after
being tuesdaie, the parlement began againe, [Sidenote: Sir Iohn Chenie speaker of the parlement
dismissed, and William Durward admitted.] and the next daie sir Iohn Cheinie that was speaker,
excusing himselfe, by reason of his infirmitie and sicknesse, not to be able to exercise that
roome, [Sidenote: Acts repealed.] was dismissed, and one William Durward esquier was admitted.
Herewith were the acts established in the parlement of the one & twentith yeare of king Richards
reigne repealed and made void, [Sidenote: Acts confirmed.] and the ordinances deuised in the
parlement holden the eleuenth yeare of the same king, confirmed, and againe established for
good and profitable. ¶ On the same daie, the kings eldest sonne lord Henrie, by assent of all
the states in the parlement, was created prince of Wales, duke of Cornwall, and earle of Chester,
then being of the age of twelue yeares.

Upon the thursdaie, the commons came and rehearsed all the errors of the last parlement holden
in the one and twentith yeare of king Richard, & namelie in certeine fiue of them.

1 First, that where the king that now is, was readie to arraigne an appeale against the duke
of Norfolke, he dooing what perteined to his dutie in that behalfe, was yet banished afterwards
without anie reasonable cause.

2 Secondlie, the archbishop of Canturburie, metropolitan of the realme, was foreiudged without
answer.

3 Thirdlie, the duke of Glocester was murthered, and after foreiudged.

4 Fourthlie, where the earle of Arundell alledged his charters of pardon, the same might not
be allowed.

5 Fiftlie, that all the power of that euill parlement was granted and assigned ouer to certeine
persons, and sith that such heinous errors could not be committed (as was thought) without
the assent and aduise of them that were of the late kings councell, they made sute that they
might be put vnder arrest, and committed to safe kéeping, till order might be further taken
for them.

Thus much adoo there was in this parlement, speciallie about them that were thought to be guiltie
of the duke of Glocesters death, and of the condemning of the other lords that were adiudged
traitors in the forsaid late parlement holden in the said one and twentith yeare of king Richards
reigne. [Sidenote: Fabian.] [Sidenote: Sir Iohn Bagot discloseth secrets.] Sir Iohn Bagot knight
then prisoner in the Tower, disclosed manie secrets, vnto the which he was priuie; and being
brought on a daie to the barre, a bill was read in English which he had made, conteining certeine
euill practises of king Richard; and further what great affection the same king bare to the
duke of Aumarle, insomuch that he heard him say, that if he should renounce the gouernement
of the kingdome, he wished to leaue it to the said duke, [Sidenote: Henrie the fourth suspected
not to be well affected towards the church before his comming to the crowne.] as to the most
able man (for wisdome and manhood) of all other: for though he could like better of the duke
of Hereford, yet he said that he knew if he were once king, he would proue an extreame enimie
and cruell tyrant to the church.

It was further conteined in that bill, that as the same Bagot rode on a daie behind the duke
of Norfolke in the Sauoy stréet toward Westminster, the duke asked him what he knew of the
manner of the duke of Glocester his death, and he answered that he knew nothing at all: but
the people (quoth he) do say that you have murthered him. Wherevnto the duke sware great othes
that it was vntrue, and that he had saued his life contrarie to the will of the king, and certeine
other lords, by the space of thrée wéeks, and more; affirming withall, that he was neuer in
all his life-time more affraid of death, than he was at his comming home againe from Calis
at that time, to the kings presence, by reason he had not put the duke to death. And then (said
he) the king appointed one of his owne seruants, and certeine other that were seruants to other
lords to go with him to see the said duke of Glocester put to death, swearing that as he should
answer afore God, it was neuer his mind that he should haue died in the fort, but onelie for
feare of the king, and sauing of his owne life. [Sidenote: The duke of Aumarle accused.] Neverthelesse,
there was no man in the realme to whom king Richard was so much beholden, as to the duke of
Aumarle: for he was the man that to fulfill his mind, had set him in hand with all that was
doone against the said duke, and the other lords. There was also conteined in that bill, what
secret malice king Richard had conceiued against the duke of Hereford being in exile, whereof
the same Bagot had sent intelligence vnto the duke into France, by one Rogert Smart, who certified
it to him by Piers Buckton, and others, to the intent he should the better haue regard to himselfe.
There was also conteined in the said bill, that Bagot had heard the duke of Aumarle say, that
he had rather than twentie thousand pounds that the duke of Hereford were dead, not for anie
feare he had of him, but for the trouble and mischéefe that he was like to procure within the
realme.

[Sidenote: The duke of Aumarle his answer vnto Bagots bill.] After that the bill had béene
read and heard, the duke of Aumarle rose vp and said, that as touching the points conteined
in the bill concerning him, they were vtterlie false and vntrue, which he would proue with
his bodie, in what manner soeuer it should be thought requisit. Therewith also the duke of
Excester rose vp, and willed Bagot that if he could say anie thing against him to speak it
openlie. Bagot answered, that for his part he could say nothing against him: [Sidenote: Iohn
Hall a yeoman.] But there is (said he) a yeoman in Newgat one Iohn hall that can say somewhat.
“Well then (said the duke of Excester) this that I doo and shall say is true, that the late
king, the duke of Norfolke, and thou being at Woodstoke, made me to go with you into the chappell,
and there the doore being shut, ye made me to sweare vpon the altar, to kéepe counsell in that
ye had to say to me, and then ye rehearsed that we should neuer haue our purpose, so long as
the duke of Lancaster liued, & therefore ye purposed to haue councell at Lichfield, & there
you would arrest the duke of Lancaster, in such sort as by colour of his disobeieng the arrest,
he should be dispatched out of life. And in this manner ye imagined his death. To the which
I answered, that it were conuenient the king should send for his councell, and if they agréed
herevnto, I would not be against it, and so I departed.” To this Bagot made no answer.

After this, the king commanded that the lords, Berklei, and Louell, and six knights of the
lower house, should go after dinner to examine the said Hall. This was on a thursdaie being
the fiftéenth of October. [Sidenote: Bagott and Hall brought to the barre.] On the saturdaie
next insuing, sir William Bagot and the said Iohn Hall were brought both to the barre, and
Bagot was examined of certeine points, and sent againe to prison. The lord Fitzwater herewith
rose vp, and said to the king, that where the duke of Aumarle excuseth himselfe of the duke
of Glocesters death, [Sidenote: The lord Fitzwater appealeth the duke of Aumarle of treason.]
I say (quoth he) that he was the verie cause of his death, and so he appealed him of treason,
offering by throwing downe his hood as a gage to proue it with his bodie. There were twentie
other lords also that threw downe their hoods, as pledges to proue the like matter against
the duke of Aumarle. The duke of Aumarle threw downe his hood to trie it against the lord Fitzwater,
as against him that lied falselie, in that he had charged him with, by that his appeale. These
gages were deliuered to the constable and marshall of England, and the parties put vnder arrest.

The duke of Surrie stood vp also against the lord Fitzwater, auouching that where he had said
that the appellants were causers of the duke of Glocesters death, it was false, for they were
constrained to sue the same appeale, in like manner as the said lord Fitzwater was compelled
to giue iudgement against the duke of Glocester, and the earle of Arundell; so that the suing
of the appeale was doone by constraint, and if he said contrarie he lied: and therewith he
threw downe his hood. The lord Fitzwater answered herevnto, that he was not present in the
parlement house, when iudgement was giuen against them, and all the lords bare witnesse thereof.
Moreouer, where it was alledged that the duke of Aumarle should send two of his seruants to
Calis, to murther the duke of Glocester, the said duke of Aumarle said, that if the duke of
Norfolke affirme it, he lied falselie, and that he would proue with his bodie, throwing downe
an other hood which he had borowed. The same was likewise deliuered to the constable and marshall
of England, [Sidenote: Fabian.] and the king licenced the duke of Norfolke to returne, that
he might arraigne his appeale. After this was Iohn Hall condemned of treason by authoritie
of the parlement, for that he had confessed himself to be one of them that put the duke of
Glocester to death at Calis, and so on the mondaie following, [Sidenote: Iohn Hall executed.]
he was drawne from the Tower to Tiburne, and there hanged, bowelled, headed, and quartered:
his head being sent to Calis there to be set vp, where the duke was murthered.

[Sidenote: Iohn Stow. The request of the commons.] On Wednesdaie following, request was made
by the commons, that sith king Richard had resigned, and was lawfullie deposed from his roiall
dignitie, he might haue iudgement decréed against him, so as the realme were not troubled by
him, and that the causes of his deposing might be published through the realme for satisfieng
of the people: which demand was granted. [Sidenote: Hall. A bold bishop and a faithfull.] Wherevpon
the bishop of Carleill, a man both learned, wise, and stout of stomach, boldlie shewed foorth
his opinion concerning that demand; affirming that there was none amongst them woorthie or
meet to giue iudgement vpon so noble a prince as king Richard was, whom they had taken for
their souereigne and liege lord, by the space of two & twentie yeares and more; “And I assure
you (said he) there is not so ranke a traitor, nor so errant a théef, nor yet so cruell a murtherer
apprehended or deteined in prison for his offense, but he shall be brought before the iustice
to heare his iudgement; and will ye procéed to the iudgement of an anointed king, hearing neither
his answer nor excuse? I say, that the duke of Lancaster whom ye call king, hath more trespassed
to K. Richard & his realme, than king Richard hath doone either to him, or vs: for it is manifest
& well knowne, that the duke was banished the realme by K. Richard and his councell, and by
the iudgement of his owne father, for the space of ten yeares, for what cause ye know, and
yet without licence of king Richard, he is returned againe into the realme, and (that is woorse)
hath taken vpon him the name, title, & preheminence of king, And therfore I say, that you haue
doone manifest wrong, to procéed in anie thing against king Richard, without calling him openlie
to his answer and defense.” ¶ As soone as the bishop had ended this tale, he was attached by
the earle marshall, and committed to ward in the abbei of saint Albons.

Moreouer, where the king had granted to the earle of Westmerland the countie of Richmond, [Sidenote:
The duke of Britaine.] the duke of Britaine pretending a right thereto by an old title, had
sent his letters ouer vnto the estates assembled in this parlement, offering to abide such
order as the law would appoint in the like case to anie of the kings subiects. Wherevpon the
commons for the more suertie of the intercourse of merchants, besought the king that the matter
might be committed to the ordering of the councell of either of the parties, and of his counsell,
so as an end might be had therein, which request was likewise granted. After this, the records
of the last parlement were shewed, with the appeales, & the commission made to twelue persons,
to determine things that were motioned in the same last parlement. Héerevpon the commons praied
that they might haue iustice Markham, and maister Gascoigne a sergeant at the law ioined with
them for counsell, touching the perusing of the records, which was granted them, and day giuen
ouer till the next morrow in the White-hall, where they sat about these matters thrée daies
togither.

On the morrow following, being the éeuen of Simon and Iude the apostles, [Sidenote: K. Richard
appointed to be kept in perpetuall prison. Hall.] the commons required to heare the iudgement
of king Richard. Wherevpon the archbishop of Canturburie appointed to speake, declared how
that the king that now is, had granted king Richard his life; but in such wise as he should
remaine in perpetuall prison, so safelie kept, that neither the king nor realme should be troubled
with him. It was also concluded, that if anie man went about to deliuer him, that then he should
be the first that should die for it. After this, the commons praied that the lords and other
that were of king Richards counsell, might be put to their answers for their sundrie misdemeanors,
which was granted. On Wednesday following, being the morrow after the feast of Simon and Iude,
all the processe of the parlement holden the 21 yéere of king Richards reigne was read openlie,
[Sidenote: The earle of Warwike.] in which it was found, how the earle of Warwike had confessed
himselfe guiltie of treason, and asked pardon and mercie for his offense: but the earle denied
that euer he acknowledged anie such thing by woord of mouth, and that he would prooue in what
manner soeuer should be to him appointed. Therein was also the appeale found of the dukes of
Aumarle, Surrie, and Excester, the marquesse Dorset, the earles of Salisburie and Glocester;
vnto the which ech of them answered by himselfe, that they neuer assented to that appeale of
their owne frée wils, but were compelled thereto by the king: and this they affirmed by their
othes, and offered to prooue it by what manner they should be appointed.

[Sidenote: Sir Walter Clopton.] Sir Walter Clopton said then to the commons; If ye will take
aduantage of the processe of the last parlement, take it, and ye shall be receiued therevnto.
Then rose vp the lord Morlie, and said to the earle of Salisburie, that he was chiefe of counsell
with the duke of Glocester, and likewise with king Richard, & so discouered the dukes counsell
to the king, as a traitor to his maister, and that he said he would with his bodie prooue against
him, throwing downe his hood as a pledge. [Sidenote: The lord Morlie appeleth the earle of
Salisburie.] The earle of Salisburie sore mooued héerewith, told the lord Morlie, that he falslie
béelied him, for he was neuer traitor, nor false to his maister all his life time, and therewith
threw downe his gloue to wage battell against the lord Morlie. Their gages were taken vp, and
deliuered to the constable and marshall of England, and the parties were arrested, and day
to them giuen till another time.

On Mondaie following, being the morrow after All soules day, the commons made request, that
they might not be entred in the parlement rols, as parties to the iudgement giuen in this parlement,
but there as in verie truth they were priuie to the same: for the iudgement otherwise belonged
to the king, except where anie iudgment is giuen by statute enacted for the profit of the common-wealth,
which request was granted. Diuers other petitions were presented on the behalfe of the commons,
part whereof were granted, and to some there was none answere made at that time. Finallie,
to auoid further inconuenience, and to qualifie the minds of the enuious, [Sidenote: Dukes
and others depriued of their titles.] it was finallie enacted, that such as were appellants
in the last parlement against the duke of Glocester and other, should in this wise following
be ordred. The dukes of Aumarle, Surrie, and Excester there present, were iudged to loose their
names of dukes, togither with the honors, titles and dignities therevnto belonging. The marquesse
Dorset being likewise there present, was adiudged to lose his title and dignitie of marquesse;
and the earle of Glocester being also present, was in semblable maner iudged to lose his name,
title and dignitie of earle.

[Sidenote: Tho. Walsi.] Moreouer, it was further decréed against them, that they and euerie
of them should lose and forfeit all those castels, lordships, manors, lands, possessions, rents,
seruices, liberties and reuenues, whatsoeuer had beene giuen to them, at or since the last
parlement, belonging aforetime to any of those persons whom they had appealed, and all other
their castels, manors, lordships, lands, possessions, rents, seruices, liberties, and reuenues
whatsoeuer, which they held of the late kings gift, the daie of the arrest of the said duke
of Glocester, or at any time after, should also remaine in the kings disposition from thencefoorth,
and all letters patents and charters, which they or any of them had of the same names, castels,
manors, lordships, lands, possessions, and liberties, should be surrendered vp into the chancerie,
there to be cancelled. Diuerse other things were enacted in this parlement, to the preiudice
of those high estates, to satisfie mens minds that were sore displeased with their dooings
in the late kings daies, as now it manifestlie appéered. [Sidenote: The hatred which the cōmons
had cōmitted against the appellāts.] For after it was vnderstood that they should be no further
punished than as before is mentioned, great murmuring rose among the people against the king,
the archbishop of Canturburie, the earle of Northumberland, and other of the councell, for
sauing the liues of men whom the commons reputed most wicked, and not worthie in anie wise
to liue. But the king thought it best, rather with courtesie to reconcile them, than by cutting
them off by death to procure the hatred of their freends and alies, which were manie, and of
no small power.

After that the foresaid iudgement was declared with protestation by sir William Thirning iustice,
[Sidenote: The earle of Salisburie his request.] the earle of Salisburie came and made request,
that he might haue his protestation entered against the lord Morlie, which lord Morlie rising
vp from his seat, said, that so he might not haue; bicause in his first answer he made no protestation,
and therefore he was past it now. The earle praied day of aduisement, but the lord Morlie praied
that he might lose his aduantage, sith he had not entered sufficient plee against him. [Sidenote:
Sir Mathew Gournie.] Then sir Matthew Gournie sitting vnderneath the king said to the earle
of Salisburie, that forsomuch as at the first day in your answers, ye made no protestation
at all, none is entered of record, and so you are past that aduantage: and therefore asked
him if he would asked him if he would saie any other thing. [Sidenote: The earle of Salisburie
mainprised.] Then the earle desired that he might put in mainprise, which was granted: and
so the earle of Kent, sir Rafe Ferrers, sir Iohn Roch, & sir Iohn Draiton knights, mainprised
the said earle bodie for bodie. For the lord Morlie all the lords and barons offred to vndertake,
and to be suerties for him; but yet foure of them had their names entered, that is to saie,
[Sidenote: The lord Morlie mainprised.] the lords Willoughbie, Beauchampe, Scales, and Berkelie:
they had day till the fridaie after to make their libell.

[Sidenote: The lord Fitzwater.] After this came the lord Fitzwater, and praied to haue day
and place to arreigne his appeale against the earle of Rutland. The king said he would send
for the duke of Norffolke to returne home, and then vpon his returne he said he would proceed
in that matter. Manie statutes were established in this parlement, as well concerning the whole
bodie of the common-wealth (as by the booke thereof imprinted may appeare) as also concerning
diuerse priuate persons then presentlie liuing, which partlie we haue touched, and partlie
for doubt to be ouer-tedious, we doo omit. [Sidenote: The archb. of Canturburie restored to
his sée.] But this among other is not to be forgotten that the archbishop of Canturburie was
not onelie restored to his former dignitie, being remooued from it by king Richard, who had
procured one Roger Walden to be placed therein (as before ye haue heard) but also the said
Walden was established Bishop of London, wherewith he séemed well content.

[Sidenote: Thom. Wals.] [Sidenote: Hall.] Moreouer, the kings eldest sonne Henrie alreadie
created (as heire to his father, and to the crowne) prince of Wales, duke of Cornewall, [Sidenote:
The crowne intailed.] and earle of Chester, was also intituled duke of Aquitaine: and to auoid
all titles, claimes, and ambiguities, there was an act made for the vniting of the crowne vnto
king Henrie the fourth, and to the heires of his bodie lawfullie begotten, his foure sonnes,
Henrie, Thomas, Iohn, and Humfrie, being named, as to whom the right should descend successiuelie
by waie of intaile, in case where heires failed to any of them. By force of this act king Henrie
thought himselfe firmelie set on a sure foundation, not néeding to feare any storme of aduerse
fortune. But yet shortlie after he was put in danger to haue béene set besides the seat, by
a conspiracie begun in the abbat of Westminsters house, which, had it not beene hindred, it
is doubtfull whether the new king should haue inioied his roialtie, or the old king (now a
prisoner) restored to his principalitie. But God (of whome the poet saith,

  ------------humana rotat
  Instar volu’cris pulueris acti
  Turbine celeri mobilis auræ)

had purposed a disappointment of their coniuration, and therefore no maruell though the issue
of their labours were infortunat by their flattering hope.

But now to make an end with this parlement. After that things were concluded and granted, so
as was thought to stand with the suertie of the king, and good quiet of the realme, the king
granted a free pardon to all his subiects, those excepted that were at the murther of the duke
of Glocester, and such as had committed wilfull murther, or rape, or were knowne to be notorious
théeues. And those that were to take benefit by this pardon, were appointed to sue foorth the
charters therof, betwixt that present and the feast of All saints next insuing, [Sidenote:
Tho. Walsi.] and so was this parlement dissolued. Immediatlie after, the king (according to
an order taken in the same parlement, to giue to vnderstand vnto all princes and countries
about him, by what title and occasion he had taken to him the kingdome) sent ambassadors vnto
them to signifie the same. [Sidenote: Ambassadors sent to forren princes.] Into Rome were sent,
Iohn Treneuant bishop of Hereford, sir Iohn Cheinie knight, & Iohn Cheinie esquier. Into France,
master Walter Skirlow bishop of Durham, and Thomas Persie earle of Worcester. Into Spaine,
Iohn Trenour bishop of saint Asaph, and sir William Parre knight. Into Almanie the bishop of
Bangor, and two others.

[Sidenote: The castell of Warke taken by the Scots. Sir Thom. Greie.] The Scots in time of
the late parlement, taking occasion of the absence of the northerne lords, and also by reason
of great mortalitie that afflicted the northerne people that yeare, inuaded the borders, tooke
the castell of Warke, that was assigned to the safe keeping of sir Thomas Greie knight, who
then was at the parlement, as one of the knights of the shire, by meanes of whose absence,
the enimies the sooner (as is to be thought) obteined their desire, and so kept that castell
a certeine time, and finallie spoiled it, and ouerthrew it to the ground. Besides all this
they did manie other mischeefes in the countrie, [Sidenote: The death of the duke of Norffolke.]
to the vndooing of manie of the kings subiects. This yeare Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norffolke
died in exile at Venice, whose death might haue béene worthilie bewailed of all the realme,
[Sidenote: The duchesse of Glocester deceasseth.] if he had not béene consenting to the death
of the duke of Glocester. The same yeare deceassed the duchesse of Glocester, thorough sorrow
(as was thought) which she conceiued for the losse of hir sonne and heire the lord Humfrie,
who being sent for foorth of Ireland (as before ye haue heard) was taken with the pestilence,
and died by the waie.

[Sidenote: Hall.] But now to speake of the conspiracie, which was contriued by the abbat of
Westminster as chéefe instrument thereof. Ye shall vnderstand, [Sidenote: What mooued the abbat
of Westminster to conspire against the king.] that this abbat (as it is reported) vpon a time
heard king Henrie saie, when he was but earle of Derbie, and yoonge of yeares, that princes
had too little, and religious men too much. He therefore doubting now, least if the king continued
long in the estate, he would remooue the great beame that then greeued his eies, and pricked
his conscience, became an instrument to search out the minds of the nobilitie, and to bring
them to an assemblie and councell, where they might consult and commen togither, how to bring
that to effect, which they earnestlie wished and desired; that was, the destruction of king
Henrie, and the restoring of king Richard. For there were diuerse lords that shewed themselues
outwardlie to fauor king Henrie, where they secretlie wished & sought his confusion. The abbat
after he had felt the minds of sundrie of them, called to his house on a day in the terme time,
all such lords & other persons which he either knew or thought to be as affectioned to king
Richard, so enuious to the prosperitie of king Henrie, whose names were, Iohn Holland earle
of Huntington late duke of Excester, [Sidenote: The lords that conspired against the duke.]
Thomas Holland earle of Kent late duke of Surrie, Edward earle of Rutland late duke of Aumarle
sonne to the duke of Yorke, Iohn Montacute earle of Salisburie, Hugh lord Spenser late earle
of Glocester, Iohn the bishop of Carleill, sir Thomas Blunt, and Maudelen a priest one of king
Richards chappell, a man as like him in stature and proportion in all lineaments of bodie,
as vnlike in birth, dignitie, and conditions.

The abbat highlie feasted these lords, his speciall freends, and when they had well dined,
they withdrew into a secret chamber, where they sat downe in councell, and after much talke
& conference had about the bringing of their purpose to passe concerning the destruction of
king Henrie, at length by the aduise of the earle of Huntington it was deuised, [Sidenote:
A iusts deuised to be holden at Oxford.] that they should take vpon them a solemne iusts to
be enterprised betweene him and 20 on his part, & the earle of Salisburie and 20 with him at
Oxford, to the which triumph k. Henrie should be desired, & when he should be most busilie
marking the martiall pastime, he suddenlie should be slaine and destroied, and so by that means
king Richard, who as yet liued, might be restored to libertie, and haue his former estate &
dignitie. It was further appointed, who should assemble the people, the number and persons
which should accomplish and put in execution their deuised enterprise. Hervpon was an indenture
sextipartite made, sealed with their seales, [Sidenote: An indenture sextipartite.] and signed
with their hands, in the which each stood bound to other, to do their whole indeuour for the
accomplishing of their purposed exploit. Moreouer, they sware on the holie euangelists to be
true and secret each to other, euen to the houre and point of death.

[Sidenote: He is desired to come and see the iusts.] When all things were thus appointed, the
earle of Huntington came to the king vnto Windsore, earnestlie requiring him, that hé would
vouchsafe to be at Brentford on the daie appointed of their iustes, both to behold the same,
and to be the discouerer and indifferent iudge (if anie ambiguitie should rise) of their couragious
acts and dooings. The king being thus instantlie required of his brother in law, and nothing
lesse imagining than that which was pretended, gentlie granted to fulfill his request. Which
thing obteined, all the lords of the conspiracie departed home to their houses, as they noised
it, to set armorers on worke about the trimming of their armour against the iusts, and to prepare
all other furniture and things readie, as to such a high & solemne triumph apperteined. The
earle of Huntington came to his house and raised men on euerie side, and prepared horsse and
harness for his compassed purpose, and when he had all things readie, he departed towards Brenford,
and at his comming thither, he found all his mates and confederates there, well appointed for
their purpose, except the earle of Rutland, by whose follie their practised conspiracie was
brought to light and disclosed to king Henrie. For this earle of Rutland departing before from
Westminster to sée his father the duke of Yorke, as he sat at dinner, had his counterpane of
the indenture of the confederacie in his bosome.

[Sidenote: The duke of Yorke taketh the indenture from his son.] The father espieing it, would
néeds sée what it was: and though the sonne humblie denied to shew it, the father being more
earnest to sée it, by force tooke it out of his bosome; and perceiuing the contents thereof,
in a great rage caused his horsses to be sadled out of hand, and spitefullie reproouing his
sonne of treason, for whome he was become suertie and mainpernour for his good abearing in
open parlement, he incontinentlie mounted on horssebacke to ride towards Windsore to the king,
to declare vnto him the malicious intent of his complices. The earle of Rutland séeing in what
danger he stood, tooke his horsse and rode another waie to Windsore in post, so that he got
thither before his father, and when he was alighted at the castell gate, [Sidenote: The earle
of Rutland vttereth the whole conspiracie to the king.] he caused the gates to be shut, saieing
that he must néeds deliuer the keies to the king. When he came before the kings presence, he
kneeled downe on his knées, beséeching him of mercie and forgiuenesse, and declaring the whole
matter vnto him in order as euerie thing had passed, obteined pardon. Therewith came his father,
and being let in, deliuered the indenture which he had taken from his sonne, vnto the king,
who thereby perceiuing his sonnes words to be true, changed his purpose for his going to Brenford,
and dispatched messengers foorth to signifie vnto the earle of Northumberland his high constable,
and to the earle of Westmerland his high marshall, and to other his assured freends, of all
the doubtfull danger and perillous ieopardie.

The conspirators being at Brenford, at length perceiued by the lacke of the earle of Rutland,
that their enterprise was reuealed to the king, and therevpon determined now openlie with speare
and shield to bring that to passe which before they couertlie attempted, [Sidenote: Magdalen
counterfeited to be king Richard.] and so they adorned Maudelen, a man most resembling king
Richard, in roiall and princelie vesture, and named him to be king Richard, affirming that
by fauour of his kéepers he was escaped out of prison, and so they came forwards in order of
warre, to the intent to destroie king Henrie. Whilest the confederators with their new published
idoll, accompanied with a strong armie of men, [Sidenote: The K. cometh to the tower of London.]
tooke the direct waie towards Windsore, king Henrie admonished thereof, with a few horssemen
in the night came to the Tower of London about twelue of the clocke, where in the morning he
caused the maior of the citie to apparell in armour the best and most couragious persons of
the citie, which brought to him thrée thousand archers, and three thousand bill-men, besides
them that were appointed to kéepe and defend the citie.

[Sidenote: The lords come to Windesore.] The conspirators comming to Windsore, entered the
castell, and vnderstanding that the king was gon from thence to London, determined with all
spéed to make towards the citie: but changing that determination as they were on their waie,
they turned to Colbroke, [Sidenote: The king goeth foorth against them.] and there staied.
King Henrie issuing out of London with twentie thousand men, came streight to Hunslo heath,
and there pitched his campe to abide the comming of his enimies: but when they were aduertised
of the kings puissance, [Sidenote: They retire.] amazed with feare, and forthinking their begun
enterprise, as men mistrusting their owne companie, departed from thence to Berkhamstéed, [Sidenote:
They come to Circester.] and so to Circester, & there the lords tooke their lodging. The earle
of Kent, and the earle of Salisburie in one Inne, and the earle of Huntington and lord Spenser
in an other, and all the host laie in the fields, [Sidenote: The bailiffe of Circester setteth
vpon them on their lodgings.] wherevpon in the night season, the bailiffe of the towne with
fourescore archers set on the house, where the erle of Kent and the other laie, which house
was manfullie assaulted and stronglie defended a great space. [Sidenote: The lords set fire
on their lodgings.] The earle of Huntington being in an other Inne with the lord Spenser, set
fire on diuerse houses in the towne, thinking that the assailants would leaue the assault and
rescue their goods, which thing they nothing regarded. The host lieng without, hearing noise,
and seeing this fire in the towne, [Sidenote: Hall. Froissard.] thought verelie that king Henrie
had béene come thither with his puissance, and therevpon fled without measure, euerie man making
shift to saue himselfe, and so that which the lords deuised for their helpe, wrought their
destruction; for if the armie that laie without the towne had not mistaken the matter, when
they saw the houses on fire, they might easilie haue succoured their chéefeteins in the towne,
that were assailed but with a few of the townesmen, in comparison of the great multitude that
laie abroad in the fields. But such was the ordinance of the mightie Lord of hostes, who disposeth
althings at his pleasure.

The earle of Huntington and his companie seeing the force of the townesmen to increase, fled
out on the backside, intending to repaire to the armie which they found dispersed and gone.
Then the earle seeing no hope of comfort, fled into Essex. The other lords which were left
fighting in the towne of Circester, were wounded to death and taken, and their heads stricken
off and sent to London. Thus writeth Hall of this conspiracie, [Sidenote: Thom. Wals.] in following
what author I know not. But Thomas Walsingham and diuerse other séeme somewhat to dissent from
him in relation of this matter; for they write that the conspiratours ment vpon the sudden
to haue set vpon the king in the castell of Windsore, [Sidenote: A maske.] vnder colour of
a maske or mummerie, and so to have dispatched him; and restoring king Richard vnto the kingdome,
to haue recouered their former titles of honour, with the possessions which they had lost by
iudgement of the last parlement. But the king getting knowledge of their pretensed treasons,
got him with all spéed vnto London.

The conspirators, to wit, the earles of Kent and Salisburie, sir Rafe Lumlie, and others, supposing
that the king had not vnderstood their malicious purpose, [Sidenote: 1400.] [Sidenote: Harding.]
the first sundaie of the new yeare, which fell in the octaues of the Innocents, came in the
twilight of the euening into Windsore with foure hundred armed men, where vnderstanding that
the king was withdrawne upon warning had of their purposed intention, they forthwith returned
backe, and came first vnto Sunnings, a manor place not farre from Reading, where the quéene
wife to king Richard then laie. [Sidenote: The words of the earle of Kent.] Here setting a
good countenance of the matter, the earle of Kent declared in presence of the queenes servants
that the lord Henrie of Lancaster was fled from his presence with his children and fréends,
and had shut up himselfe & them in the Tower of London, as one afraid to come abroad, for all
the brags made heretofore of his manhood: and therefore (saith he) my intention is (my lords)
to go to Richard that was, is, and shall be our king, who being alreadie escaped foorth of
prison, lieth now at Pomfret, with an hundred thousand men. And to cause his spéech the better
to be beléeued, he tooke awaie the kings cognisances from them that ware the same, as the collars
from their necks, and the badges of cressants from the sleeues of the seruants of houshold,
and throwing them awaie, said that such cognisances were no longer to be borne.

Thus hauing put the quéene in a vaine hope of that which was nothing so, they departed from
thence vnto Wallingford, and after to Abington, intising the people by all meanes possible
vnto rebellion, all the waie as they went, and sending their agents abroad for the same purpose:
at length they came to Circester in the darke of the night, and tooke vp their lodgings. The
inhabitants of that towne suspecting the matter, and iudging (as the truth was) these rumors
which the lords spred abroad to be but dreams, they tooke therevpon counsell togither, got
them to armor, and stopped all the entries and outgates of the Innes where these new ghestes
were lodged, insomuch that when they about midnight secretlie attempted to haue come foorth,
and gone their waies, the townesmen with bow and arrowes were readie to slaie them, and keepe
them in. The lords perceiuing the danger, got them to their armor and weapons, and did their
best by force to breake through and repell the townesmen. But after they had fought from midnight
till three of the clocke in the afternoone of the next daie, and perceiued they could not preuaile,
they yeelded themselues to the townesmen, [Sidenote: The lords yéeld themselues.] beseeching
them to haue their liues saued, till they might come to the kings presence.

[Sidenote: A priest set fire on the houses of Circester.] This request they had obteined, if
a préest that was chapleine to one of them, had not in the meane time set fire vpon certeine
houses in the towne, to the end that whiles the townesmen should busie themselues to quench
the fire, the lords might find meanes to escape. But it came nothing to passe as he imagined,
for the townesmen leauing all care to saue their houses from the rage of the fire, were kindled
more in furie towards the lords, and so to reuenge themselves of them, they brought them foorth
of the abbei where they had them in their hands, [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Tho. Walsin. pag.
404.] and in the twilight of the euening, stroke of their heads. ¶ The earle of Salisburie
(saith Thomas Walsingham) who in all his life time had béene a fauourer of the Lollards or
Wickleuists, a despiser of images, a contemner of canons, and a scorner of the sacraments,
ended his daies (as it was reported) without the *sacrament of confession. [Sidenote *: He
died vnconfessed.] These be the words of Thom. Wals. which are set downe, to signifie that
the earle of Salisburie was a bidden ghest to blockham feast with the rest: and (as it should
séeme by his relation) the more maligned, bicause he was somwhat estranged fro the corruption
of the religion then receiued, and leaned to a sect pursued with spitefulnesse and reuenge.

[Sidenote: The lords beheaded.] Iohn Holland earle of Huntington (as Thomas Walsingham writeth)
was not with the lords at the castell of Windsore, but staied about London to behold the end
of his businesse: and hearing how the matter went, farre contrarie to that he wished, he sought
to flie by sea; but not able to get awaie, by reason the wind being contrarie would not permit
him, [Sidenote: Chr. S. Alb.] he tooke his horsse, and hauing a knight with him called sir
Iohn Shellie, he road into Essex, attempting to haue fled from thence by sea: but still the
wind was so against him, that he was continuallie driuen backe when he was about to make saile,
and so comming againe to land, [Sidenote: The earle of Huntington taken.] he was taken one
euening at Pitwell in Essex, in a mill (that belonged to one of his trustie fréends) as he
sat there at supper, togither with the said sir Iohn Shellie. The commons of the countrie that
tooke him, brought him first to Chelmesford, and after to Plashie, [Sidenote: He is beheaded.]
where on the daie of S. Maurie, that is the fiftéenth of Ianuarie, about sun setting he was
beheaded, in the verie place in which the duke of Glocester was arrested by king Richard. He
confessed with lamentable repentance (as writers doo record) that diuers & manie waies he had
offended God and his prince, because that vnderstanding the purpose of the other lords, he
had not reuealed the same.

[Sidenote *: Thomas Spenser, saith Wal. & others.] The lord *Hugh Spenser, otherwise called
earle of Glocester, as he would haue fled into Wales, was taken and carried to Bristow, [Sidenote:
Hall.] where (according to the earnest desires of the commons) he was beheaded. Maudelen fléeing
into Scotland, was taken by the waie, and brought to the Tower. Manie other that were priuie
to this conspiracie, [Sidenote: Execution.] were taken, and put to death, some at Oxford, as
sir Thomas Blunt, sir Benet Cilie knight, and Thomas Wintercell esquier; but sir Leonard Brokas,
and sir Iohn Shellie knights, Iohn Maudelen, and William Ferbie chapleins, were drawne, hanged,
and beheaded at London. [Sidenote: Tho. Walsing. Hall.] There were ninetéene in all executed
in one place and other, and the heads of the cheefe conspirators were set on polles ouer London
bridge, to the terror of others. Shortlie after, the abbat of Westminster, [Sidenote: The abbat
of Westminster dieth suddēlie. Thom. Wals.] in whose house the conspiracie was begun (as is
said) gooing betweene his monasterie & mansion, for thought fell into a sudden palsie, and
shortlie after, without speech, ended his life. The bishop of Carleill was impeached, [Sidenote:
The bishop of Carleill dieth through feare, or rather thorough gréefe of mind, to sée the wicked
prosper as he tooke it. Hall.] and condemned of the same conspiracie; but the King of his mercifull
clemencie, pardoned him of that offense, although he died shortly after, more through feare
than force or sicknesse, as some haue written. Thus all the associats of this vnhappie conspiracie
tasted the painefull penance of their plesant pastime.

Thus haue yee heard what writers haue recorded of this matter, with some difference betwixt
them that write, how the king should haue béene made awaie at a iusts; and other that testifie,
how it should haue béene at a maske or mummerie: but whether they meant to haue dispatched
him at a mumming, or at a iusts, their purpose being reuealed by the earle of Rutland, they
were brought to confusion (as before yée haue heard.) And immediatlie after, king Henrie, to
rid himselfe of anie such like danger to be attempted against him thereafter, caused king Richard
to die of a violent death, that no man should afterward faine himselfe to represent his person,
[Sidenote: The sundrie reports of K. Richar. death.] though some haue said, he was not priuie
to that wicked offense. The common fame is, that he was euerie daie serued at the table with
costlie meat, like a king, to the intent that no creature should suspect anie thing done contrarie
to the order taken in the parlement; and when the meat was set before him, he was forbidden
once to touch it; yea, he was not permitted so much as to smell to it, and so he died of forced
famine.

[Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Walsi. pag. 404, 405.] ¶ But Thomas Walsingham is so farre
from imputing his death to compoulsorie famine, that he referreth it altogether to voluntarie
pining of himselfe. For when he heard that the complots and attempts of such his fauourers,
as sought his restitution, and their owne aduancement, annihilated; and the chéefe agents shamefullie
executed; he tooke such a conceit at these misfortunes (for so Thomas Walsingham termed them)
and was so beaten out of hart, that wilfullie he starued himselfe, and so died in Pomfret castell
on S. Valentines daie: a happie daie to him, for it was the beginning of his ease, and the
ending of his paine: so that death was to him daintie and swéet, as the poet saith, and that
verie well in bréefe, [Sidenote: Corn. Gall.]

  Dulce mori miseris,
  Neque est melius morte in malis rebus.

[Sidenote: Thom. Walsin. Sir Piers de Exton a murtherer of King Richard.] One writer, which
séemeth to haue great knowledge of king Richards dooings, saith, that king Henrie, sitting
on a daie at his table, sore sighing, said, “Have I no faithfull fréend which will deliuer
me of him, whose life will be my death, and whose death will be the preseruation of my life;”
This saieng was much noted of them which were present, and especiallie of one called sir Piers
of Exton. This knight incontinentlie departed from the court, with eight strong persons in
his companie, and came to Pomfret, commanding the esquier that was accustomed to sew and take
the assaie before king Richard, to doo so no more, saieng; “Let him eat now, for he shall not
long eat.” King Richard sat downe to dinner, and was serued without courtesie or assaie, wherevpon
much maruelling at the sudden change, he demanded of the esquier whie he did not his dutie;
“Sir (said he) I am otherwise commanded by sir Piers of Exton, which is newlie come from K.
Henrie.” When king Richard heard that word, he tooke the keruing knife in his hand, and strake
the esquier on the head, saieng The diuell take Henrie of Lancaster and thée togither. And
with that word, sir Piers entred the chamber, well armed, with eight tall men likewise armed,
euerie of them hauing a bill in his hand.

King Richard perceiuing this, put the table from him, & steping to the formost man, wrung the
bill out of his hands, & so valiantlie defended himselfe, [Sidenote: The desperat manhood of
king Richard.] that he slue foure of those that thus came to assaile him. Sir Piers being halfe
dismaied herewith, lept into the chaire where king Richard was wont to sit, while the other
foure persons fought with him, and chased him about the chamber. And in conclusion, as king
Richard trauersed his ground, from one side of the chamber to an other, [Sidenote: K. Richard
murthered.] & comming by the chaire, where sir Piers stood, he was felled with a stroke of
a pollax which sir Piers gaue him upon the head, and therewith rid him out of life, without
giuing him respit once to call to God for mercie of his passed offenses. It is said, that sir
Piers of Exton, after he had thus slaine him, wept right bitterlie, as one striken with the
pricke of a giltie conscience, for murthering him, whome he had so long time obeied as king.
After he was thus dead, his bodie was imbalmed, and séered, and couered with lead, all saue
the face, to the intent that all men might sée him, and perceiue that he was departed this
life: for as the corps was conueied from Pomfret to London, in all the townes and places where
those that had the conueiance of it did staie with it all night, they caused dirige to be soong
in the euening, and masse of requiem in the morning; and as well after the one seruice as the
other, his face discouered, was shewed to all that courted to behold it.

[Sidenote: The dead bodie of K. Richard brought to the Tower.] Thus was the corps first brought
to the Tower, and after through the citie, to the cathedrall church of saint Paule bare faced,
where it laie thrée daies togither, that all men might behold it. There was a solemne obsequie
doone for him, both at Paules, and after at Wesminster, at which time, both at dirige ouernight,
and in the morning at the masse of requiem, [Sidenote: He is buried at Langlie.] the king and
the citizens of London were present. When the same was ended, the corps was commanded to be
had vnto Langlie, there to be buried in the church of the friers preachers. The bishop of Chester,
the abbats of saint Albons and Waltham, celebrated the exequies for the buriall, none of the
nobles nor anie of the commons (to accompt of) being present: neither was there anie to bid
them to dinner after they had laid him in the ground, and finished the funerall seruice. He
was after by king Henrie the fift remooued to Westminster, and there honorablie intoomed with
quéene Anne his wife, although the Scots vntrulie write, that he escaped out of prison, and
led a vertuous and a solitarie life in Scotland, and there died, [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of
Fabian pag. 378.] & is buried (as they hold) in the blacke friers at Sterling. ¶ But Fabian
and others doo as it were point out the place of his interrement, saieng that he lieth intoomed
on the south side of saint Edwards shrine, with an epitaph expressing partlie his proportion
of bodie and partlie his properties of mind, as after followeth in a rimed hexastichon:

  Prudens & mundus, Richardus iure secundus,
  Perfatum victus, iacet hîc sub marmore pictus,
  Verax sermone, fuit & plenus ratione,
  Corpore procerus, animo prudens vt Homerus,
  Ecclesiæ fauit, elatus suppeditauit,
  Quemuis prostrauit, regalia qui violauit.

[Sidenote: Forren princes not without cause abhorre to heare of the shamefull murther of king
Richard.] When the newes of king Richards deposing was reported in France, king Charles and
all his court woondering, detested and abhorred such an iniurie doone to an annointed king,
to a crowned prince, and to the head of a realme: but in especiall, Walerane earle of saint
Paule, which had married king Richards halfe sister, mooued with great disdaine towards king
Henrie, ceassed not to stirre king Charles & his councell to make warres against the Englishmen,
and he himselfe sent letters of defiance into England. The earles sute was easilie agréed vnto,
and an armie roiall appointed with all speed, to inuade England. The armie was come downe into
Picardie, redie to be transported into England: but when it was certeinelie knowen, that king
Richard was dead, and that the enterprise of his deliuerance (which was chéeflie meant) was
frustrate and void, the armie was dissolued. But when the certeintie of K. Richards death was
intimate to the Gascoignes, [Sidenote: How the Gascoignes tooke the death of K. Richard.] the
most part of the the wisest men of the countrie were right pensiue: for they iudged verelie,
that hereby the English nation should be brought to dishonour, and losse of their ancient fame
and glorie, for committing so heinous an offense against their king and souereigne lord, the
memorie whereof (as they thought) would neuer die: and cheeflie, the citizens of Burdeaux tooke
the matter verie sore at the stomach: for they bare excéeding fauour to king Richard, because
he was borne and brought vp in their citie, and therefore more than all the residue they shewed
themselves to abhorre so heinous a déed.

The Frenchmen hauing understanding hereof, thought with themselues that now was the time for
them to practise with the Gascoignes to reduce them from the English obeisance, vnder their
subiection. [Sidenote: The duke of Bourbon.] Herevpon came Lewes duke of Burbon vnto Agen,
and wrote to diuerse cities and townes, on the confines of Guien, exhorting them with large
promises, and faire sugred words, to reuolt from the Englishmen, and to become subiects to
the crowne of France; but his trauell preuailed not: for the people vnderstanding that the
English yoke was but easie in comparison to the French bondage, determined to abide rather
in their old subiection, [Sidenote: Froissard.] than for a displeasure irrecouerable to aduenture
themselues on a new doubtfull perill; yet it was doubted, least the cities of Burdeaux, Dar,
and Baion, would haue reuolted, if the lords of the marches about those places had leaned to
them in that purpose, for they sent their commissioners to Agen, to treate with the duke of
Burbon. But forsomuch as the lords, Pomiers, Mucident, Duras, Landuras, Copane, Rosem, & Langurant,
were minded to continue still English, those cities durst not without them turne to the French
obeisance, for they could not haue stirred out of their gates, but those lords would haue béene
readie at their elbowes, to haue caught them by the sléeues.

King Henrie being aduertised of the Frenchmens couert meanings, and also of the wauering minds
of the Gascoignes, sent Thomas Persie earle of Worcester with two hundred men of armes, and
four hundred archers into Guien, to aid and assist sir Robert Knols, his lieutenant there.
[Sidenote: Polydor. Froissard.] The chiefest capteines that accompanied the earle in this iournie
were these: first, his nephew sir Hugh Hastings, sir Thomas Colleuill, sir William Lisle, Iohn
de Graillie base sonne to the capitall de Boeuf, sir William Draiton, sir Iohn Daubreticourt:
also there went with him the bishop of London and master Richard Doall or Dolleie. [Sidenote:
The earle of Worcester sent into Gascoigne.] The earle at his arriual so wiselie intreated
the noble men, so grauelie persuaded the magistrats of the cities and townes, and so gentlie
and familiarlie vsed and treated the commons, that he not onelie appeased their furie and malice,
but brought them to louing and vniforme obeisance, receiuing of them othes of obedience, &
loiall fealtie, which doone, he returned againe into England with great thanks.

The French king perceiuing he could not bring his purpose about, [Sidenote: Ambassadors from
the French king.] neither by inuading England, nor by practising with the Gascoignes, sent
a solemne ambassage into England, requiring to haue his daughter the ladie Isabell, sometime
espoused to king Richard, restored to him againe. King Henrie gentlie receiued those that were
sent to him about this message, [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Fabian, pag. 364.] and for answer,
promised to send his commissioners vnto Calis, which should further commune and conclude with
them. ¶ This séemeth dissonant from the report of Fabian deriued out of Gagwine. For he saith
that Charles hearing of the suppression of K. Richard, sent 2 of his houshold knights into
England, requiring king Henrie the fourth, then newlie made king, to send home his daughter
Isabell, latelie married vnto king Richard, with such dowrie as with hir was promised. In dooing
of which message king Henrie took such displeasure, that he threw the said two knights in prison;
where through one of them (named Blanchet) died in England, and, the other called Henrie, after
great sicknesse returned into France: wherefore if Fabian plaie not the fabler, those that
were sent on the said message were not gentlie receiued of king Henrie; vnlesse to be cast
in prison and discourteouslie dealt withall stand countable for beneuolence & gentle interteinment.
But to remit this and the like variances among writers to such as can reconcile them, let vs
returne to the storie.

It was not inough that K. Henrie was thus troubled now in the first yere of his reigne, with
ciuill sedition, and the couert practises of Frenchmen; but that the Scots also tooke vpon
them to make open warre against him: it chanced (as in the Scotish chronicles more at large
appeareth) that George of Dunbar, [Sidenote: George earle of March fléeth into England.] earle
of the marches of Scotland, being in displeasure with Robert king of Scots, fled into England,
to Henrie earle of Northumberland, whervpon the Scotish king depriued him of all his dignities
and possessions, and caused his goods to be confiscate, and after wrote to the king of England,
requiring him if he would haue the truce anie longer to continue, [Sidenote: The answer of
king Henrie to the Scotish ambassadors.] either to deliuer into his possession the earle of
March and other traitors to his person, or else to banish them out of his realmes and dominions.
King Henrie discréetly answerd the herald of Scotland, that the words of a prince ought to
be kept: and his writings and seale to be inuiolate: and considering that he had granted a
safe conduct to the earle and his companie, [Sidenote: Open warre proclaimed by the king of
Scots against England. Thom. Wals.] he should neither without cause reasonable breake his promise,
nor yet deface his honor. Which answer declared to the king of Scots, he incontinentlie proclaimed
open warre against the king of England, with fire and sword. Herevpon, one sir Robert Logon,
a Scotish knight, with certeine ships well appointed for the warre, meant to haue destroied
the English fléet that was come on the coasts of Scotland, about Aberden, to fish there: [Sidenote:
Robert Logon taken prisoner.] but (as it chanced) he met with certeine ships of Lin, that fought
with him, and tooke him prisoner, with the residue of his companie, so that he quite failed
of his purpose, and came to the losse himselfe.

[Sidenote: The Iles of Orkenie spoiled by Englishmen.] At the same time, the Englishmen spoiled
also certeine of the Iles of Orkenie. [Sidenote: Mortalitie of people.] This summer, great
death chanced in this land, manie dieing of the pestilence, wherewith sundrie places were infected.
King Henrie perceiuing that policie oftentimes preuenteth perill, [Sidenote: King Henrie inuadeth
Scotland.] and vnderstanding the naughtie purposes of the Scots, gathered a great armie, and
entred into Scotland, burning townes, villages, and castels, with a great part of the townes
of Edenburgh and Léeth, [Sidenote: The duke of Rothsaie.] and besieged the castell of Edenburgh
in the end of September, whereof was capteine Dauid duke of Rothsaie, and a prince of the realme,
with Archembald earle of Dowglas, [Sidenote: The duke of Albanie.] hauing with them manie hardie
men of warre. Robert duke of Albanie, that was appointed gouernour of the realme, because the
king was sicke and not méet to rule, sent an herald vnto king Henrie, [Sidenote: Anno Reg.
2.] promising him battell within six daies at the furthest, if he would so long tarrie, which
king Henrie promised to doo right gladlie, and gaue to the herald for bringing him so acceptable
newes, a gowne of silke, and a cheine of gold. But king Henrie staied six daies, and sixtéene
too, without hearing any word of the gouernors comming. Then the winter beginning to wax cold,
and foule weather still increasing, caused the king to breake vp his siege, and so returned
without battell or skirmish offered.

[Sidenote: King Henrie returneth home. The Scots burne in Northumberland.] In the meane time
that the king was thus in Scotland, the Scots made a rode into Northumberland, and burned diuerse
townes in Bamburroughshire. At the kings comming backe to Yorke, there were two strangers,
the one a Frenchman, [Sidenote: Iusts at Yorke.] and the other an Italian, requiring to accomplish
certeine feats of armes, against sir Iohn Cornewall, and Ianico de Artois. [Sidenote: Sir Iohn
Cornewall marrieth the kings sister.] Their request was granted, and the strangers were put
to the worst, whereby sir Iohn Cornewall obteined the kings fauour so farre foorth, that he
married the kings sister, the widow of Iohn Holland, earle of Huntington. Yet some said, that
the knight and the countesse were agréed aforehand, without the kings consent. In the kings
absence, [Sidenote: The welshmen rebell by the setting on of Owen Glendouer.] whilest he was
foorth of the realme in Scotland against his enimies, the Welshmen tooke occasion to rebell
vnder the conduct of their capteine Owen Glendouer, [Sidenote: Iohn Stow.] [Sidenote: Owen
Glendouer what he was.] dooing what mischeefe they could deuise, vnto their English neighbours.
This Owen Glendouer was sonne to an esquier of Wales, named Griffith Vichan: he dwelled in
the parish of Conwaie, within the countie of Merioneth in North Wales, in a place called Glindourwie,
which is as much to saie in English, as The vallie by the side of the water of Dée, by occasion
whereof he was surnamed Glindour Dew.

He was first set to studie the lawes of the realme, and became an vtter barrester, or an apprentise
of the law (as they terme him) and serued king Richard at Flint castell, when he was taken
by Henrie duke of Lancaster, [Sidenote: Tho. Walsi.] though other haue written that he serued
this king Henrie the fourth, before he came to atteine the crowne, in roome of an esquier,
and after, by reason of variance that rose betwixt him and the lord Reginald Greie of Ruthin,
about the lands which he claimed to be his by right of inheritance: when he saw that he might
not preuaile, [Sidenote: The ocassion that mooued him to rebell.] finding no such fauor in
his sute as he looked for, he first made warre against the said lord Greie, wasting his lands
and possessions with fire and sword, [Sidenote: The king entreth into wales, meaning to chastise
the rebels.] cruellie killing his seruants and tenants. The king aduertised of such rebellious
exploits, enterprised by the said Owen, and his vnrulie complices, determined to chastise them,
as disturbers of his peace, and so with an armie entered into Wales; but the Welshmen with
their capteine withdrew into the mounteines of Snowdon, so to escape the reuenge, which the
king meant towards them. The king therefore did much hurt in the countries with fire and sword,
sleing diuerse that with weapon in hand came foorth to resist him, and so with a great bootie
of beasts and cattell he returned.

[Sidenote: The emperor of Constantinople cōmeth into Englād.] The emperour of Constantinople
comming into England to sue for aid against the Turkes, was met by the king on Blackeheath,
vpon the feast day of saint Thomas the apostle, and brought vnto London with great honor. The
king bare all his charges, presenting him with gifts at his departure, [Sidenote: 1401] [Sidenote:
A Parlement.] meet for such an estate. After the feast of the Epiphanie, a parlement was holden,
in which an act was made, against those that held opinions in religion, contrarie to the receiued
doctrine of the church of Rome; ordeining, that wheresoeuer any of them were found and prooued
to set foorth such doctrine, they should be apprehended, and deliuered to the bishop their
diocesane; and if they stood stiffelie in their opinions, and would not be reformed, [Sidenote:
One burnt in Smithfield.] they should be deliuered to the secular power, to be burnt to ashes.
The first that tasted the smart of this statute, was one William Hawtrée or Sawtrée a priest,
that being apprehended was burnt in Smithfield, in time of this parlement.

[Sidenote: Additions of the chronicles of Flanders.] About the same time, king Henrie according
to promise made (as ye have heard) vnto the French ambassadors, sent ouer into the countrie
of Guisnes, [Sidenote: There was also the erle of Deuonshire, as Froissard saith.] Edward earle
of Rutland, otherwise in king Richards daies intitled duke of Aumarle, son to Edmund duke of
Yorke, Henrie earle of Northumberland, and his sonne the lord Henrie Persie, the lord Yuan
Fitzwarren, the bishops of Winchester and Lincolne: where the duke of Burbon, [Sidenote: The
hath Froissard. Commissioners met to treat of peace.] the lords Charles d’Albert, Charles de
Hangest, Iohn de Chastelmorant, the Patriarche of Ierusalem, and the bishops of Paris and Beauuois,
were readie there to commune with them, and so they assembling togither at sundrie times and
places, the Frenchmen required to haue queene Isabell to them restored, but the Englishmen
séemed loth to depart with hir, requiring to haue hir married to Henrie Prince of Wales, [Sidenote:
The French king troubled with a frensie.] one in bloud and age in all things to hir equall;
but the Frenchmen would in no wise condescend thereto, without their kings consent, who at
that present was not in case to vtter his mind, being troubled with his woonted disease. The
commissioners then began treat of peace, [Sidenote: Truce for 26 yeares.] and at length renewed
the truce to endure for six and twentie yeares yet to come; wherevnto the foure yeares passed
being added, made vp the number of thirtie yeares, according to the conclusion agreed vpon,
in the life time of king Richard.

[Sidenote: Hall.] Some authors affirme, that there was a new league concluded, [Sidenote: The
Frenchmen demand a dower for quéene Isabell.] to continue, during the liues of both the princes.
The Frenchmen diuerse times required to haue some dower assigned foorth for queene Isabell,
but that was at all times vtterlie denied, for that the marriage betwixt hir and king Richard
was neuer consummate, by reason whereof she was not dowable. Neuerthelesse, she was shortlie
after sent home, vnder the conduct of the earle of Worcester, associat with diuerse other noble
and honorable personages, both men and women, hauing with hir all the iewels, ornaments, [Sidenote:
Additions of the chron. of Flanders.] and plate which she brought into England, with a great
surplusage besides giuen to hir by the king. She was deliuered betwixt Bullongne and Calis,
to Valeran earle of saint Paule, [Sidenote: She is deliuered home.] the French kings lieutenant
in Picardie, who being accompanied with the bishop of Chartres, the lord de Hugueuile, the
ladie of Monpensier sister to the erle of March, the ladie of Lucenburgh sister to the said
earle of saint Paule, & diuerse other ladies and gentlewomen, which receiued hir with great
ioy and gladnesse, and taking leaue of the English lords and ladies, they conueied hir to the
dukes of Burgognie and Burbon, [Sidenote: She is conueied to Paris.] that attended for hir,
not far off, upon a hill, with a great number of people. They first conueied hir to Bullogne,
& after to Abuile, from whence the duke of Orleance conueied hir to Paris, vnto the presence
of the king hir father, [Sidenote: Hir second marriage.] and the queene hir mother: she was
after giuen in marriage vnto Charles, sonne to Lewes duke of Orleance. [Sidenote: Anno Reg.
3. Owen Glendouer.] About the same time, Owen Glendouer and his Welshmen did much hurt to the
kings subiects. One night as the king was going to bed, [Sidenote: The danger of the king to
haue béene destroied.] he was in danger to haue beene destroied; for some naughtie traitorous
persons had conueied into his bed a certeine iron made with smiths craft, like a caltrop, with
three long prickes, sharp and small, standing vpright, it such sort, that when he had laid
him downe, & that the weight of his bodie should come vpon the bed, he should have beene thrust
in with those pricks, and peraduenture slaine: but as God would, the king not thinking of any
such thing, chanced yet to féele and perceiue the instrument before he laid him downe, and
so escaped the danger. ¶ Howbeit he was not so soone deliuered from feare; for he might well
haue his life in suspicion, & prouide for the preseruation of the same; sith perils of death
crept into his secret chamber, and laie lurking in the bed of downe where his bodie was to
be reposed and to take rest. Oh what a suspected state therefore is that of a king holding
his regiment with the hatred of his people, the hart grudgings of his courtiers, and the peremtorie
practises of both togither? Could he confidentlie compose or setle himselfe to sleepe for feare
of strangling? Durst he boldly eat and drinke without dread of poisoning? Might he aduenture
to shew himselfe in great méetings or solemne assemblies without mistrust of mischeefe against
his person intended? What pleasure or what felicitie could he take in his princelie pompe,
which he knew by manifest and fearfull experience, to be enuied and maligned to the verie death?
The state of such a king is noted by the poet in Dionysius, as in a mirror, [Sidenote: Hor.
lib. ca. 3, Ode. 1.] concerning whom it is said,

  Districtus ensis cui super impia
  Ceruice pendet, non Siculæ dapes
  Dulcem elaborabunt saporem,
  Non auium cytharæq. cantus.

[Sidenote: 1402.] [Sidenote: The earle of Warwike depareth this life. A blasing starre.] This
yeare, the eight day of April deceassed the lord Thomas Beauchampe earle of Warwike. In the
moneth of March appeared a blasing starre, first betwéene the east part of the firmament and
the North, flashing foorth fire and flames round about it, and lastlie shooting foorth fierie
beams towards the north, foreshewing (as was thought) the great effusion of bloud that followed,
about the parts of Wales and Northumberland. For much about the same time, Owen Glendouer (with
his Welshmen) fought with the lord Greie of Ruthen, comming foorth to defend his possessions,
which the same Owen wasted and destroied: and as the fortune of that daies worke fell out,
[Sidenote: The lord Greie of Ruthen taken in fight by Owē Glendouer] the lord Greie was taken
prisoner, and manie of his men were slaine. This hap lifted the Welshmen into high pride, and
increased meruelouslie their wicked and presumptuous attempts.

About Whitsuntide a conspiracie was deuised by certeine persons, that wished the kings death,
[Sidenote: A brute was spred abroad that king Richard was liuing.] mainteining and bruting
abroad, that king Richard was aliue, and therefore exhorted men to stand with him, [Sidenote:
A priest takē.] for shortlie he would come to light, and reward such as tooke his part with
iust recompense. Herewith, there was a priest taken at Ware, or (as some books haue) at Warwike,
who had a kalendar or roll, in which a great number of Names were written, more than were in
any wise guiltie of the fact, as afterwards appeared by the same priests confession. For being
examined, whether he knew such persons as he had so inrolled, & were there present before him,
he said he neuer knew them at all; and being demanded wherefore he had then so recorded their
names, he answered, because he thought they would gladlie doo what mischief they could against
king Henrie, vpon any occasion offered in reuenge of the iniuries doone to king Richard, by
whom they had beene aduanced, and princelie preferred. When therefore there appeared no more
credit in the man, [Sidenote: He is executed.] he was condemned, drawen, hanged, and quartered,
and diuerse that had beene apprehended about that matter, were released, and set at libertie.
[Sidenote: The prior of Laund apprehended.] Shortlie after, the prior of Laund (who for his
euil gouernment had béene depriued of his state and dignitie) was likewise executed, not for
attempting any thing of himselfe, but onlie for that he confessed, that he knew euil counsell
and concealed it. His name was Walter Baldocke, a canon sometime in Dunstable, and by king
Richard promoted to the priorship of Laund.

[Sidenote: Greie friers apprehended.] Also the same time, certeine greie friers were apprehended
for treason which they had deuised to bring to passe, and one of them, whose name was Richard
Frisebie, being asked what he would doo if king Richard had béene aliue, and present with them,
answered stoutlie, that he would fight against any man in his quarrell; euen to death. [Sidenote:
A greie frier hanged in his habit.] Herevpon, he was condemned, drawen, and hanged in his friers
wéed, to the great confusion of his brethren; but they made earnest instance to haue his bodie
taken downe, and buried with diriges and exequies, and had their sute granted. [Sidenote: Sir
Roger Claringdon.] Sir Roger of Claringdon knight was also put to death about this conspiracie,
with two of his seruants, the one an esquier, the other a yeoman. He was base sonne (as was
reported) vnto Edward, eldest sonne to king Edward the third, [Sidenote: The diuell appeareth
in likenesse of a greie frier.] surnamed the blacke prince. On Corpus Christi daie at euensong
time, the diuell (as was thought) appeared in a towne of Essex called Danburie, entring into
the church in likenesse of a greie frier, behauing himselfe verie outragiouslie, plaieng his
parts like a diuell indéed, so that the parishioners were put in a maruellous great fright.

At the same instant, there chanced such a tempest of wind, thunder, and lightning, that the
highest part of the roofe of that church was blowen downe, and the chancell was all to shaken,
rent, and torne in péeces. [Sidenote: Eight friers executed.] Within a small while after, eight
of those greie friers that had practised treason against the king were brought to open iudgement,
and conuicted were drawen and headed at London; and two other suffered at Leicester, all which
persons had published king Richard to be aliue. Owen Glendouer, according to his accustomed
manner, robbing and spoiling within the English borders, caused all the forces of the shire
of Hereford to assemble togither against them, vnder the conduct of Edmund Mortimer earle of
March. But cōming to trie the matter by battell, [Sidenote: The earle of March taken prisoner
in batell by Owen Glendouer.] whether by treason or otherwise, so it fortuned, that the English
power was discomfited, the earle taken prisoner, and aboue a thousand of his people slaine
in the place. The shamefull villanie vsed by the Welshwomen towards the dead carcasses, was
such, as honest eares would be ashamed to heare, and continent toongs to speake thereof. The
dead bodies might not be buried, without great summes of monie giuen for libertie to conueie
them awaie.

[Sidenote: The suspicion of K. Henrie grounded vpō a guiltie conscience.] The king was not
hastie to purchase the deliuerance of the earle March, bicause his title to the crowne was
well inough knowen, and therefore suffered him to remaine in miserable prison, wishing both
the said earle, and all other of his linage out of this life, with God and his saincts in heauen,
so they had beene out of the waie, for then all had béene well inough as he thought. But to
let these things passe, [Sidenote: The kings daughter maried into Germanie.] the king this
yeare sent his eldest daughter Blanch, accōpanied with the earle of Summerset, the bishop of
Worcester, the lord Clifford, and others, into Almanie, which brought hir to Colin, and there
with great triumph she was married to William duke of Bauier, sonne and heire to Lewes the
emperour. [Sidenote: The deceasse of the duke of Yorke.] The same time, the lord Edmund of
Langlie duke of Yorke departed this life, and was buried at Langlie with his brethren. [Sidenote:
Scots ouerthrowen.] The Scots vnder the leding of Patrike Hepborne, of the Hales the yoonger,
entring into England, were ouerthrowen at Nesbit, in the marches, as in the Scotish chronicle
ye may find more at large. This battell was fought the two and twentith of Iune, in this yeare
of our Lord 1402.

Archembald earle Dowglas sore displeased in his mind for this ouerthrow, procured a commission
to inuade England, and that to his cost, [Sidenote: Scots vanquished at Homildon.] as ye may
likewise read in the Scotish histories. For at a place called Homildon, they were so fiercelie
assailed by the Englishmen, vnder the leading of the lord Persie; surnamed Henrie Hotspur,
and George earle of March, that with violence of the English shot they were quite vanquished
and put to flight, on the Rood daie in haruest, with a great slaughter made by the Englishmen.
We know that the Scotish writers note this battell to haue chanced in the yeare 1403. But we
following Tho. Walsingham in this place, and other English writers, for the accompt of times,
[Sidenote: The number slaine.] haue thought good to place it in this yeare 1402, as in the
same writers we find it. There were slaine of men of estimation, sir Iohn Swinton, sir Adam
Gordon, sir Iohn Leuiston, sir Alexander Ramsie of Dalehousie, [Sidenote: Prisoners taken.]
and three and twentie knights, besides ten thousand of the commons: and of prisoners among
other were these, Mordacke earle of Fife, son to the gouernour Archembald earle Dowglas, which
in the fight lost one of his eies, Thomas erle of Murrey, Robert earle of Angus, and (as some
writers haue) the earles of Atholl & Menteith, with fiue hundred other of meaner degrées. After
this, the lord Persie, [Sidenote: The castell of Cocklawes besieged by the lord Persie.] hauing
bestowed the prisoners in suer kéeping, entered Tiuidale, wasting and destroieng the whole
countrie, and then besieged the castell of Cocklawes, whereof was capteine one sir Iohn Grenlow,
who compounded with the Englishmen, that if the castell were not succoured within three moneths,
then he would deliuer it into their hands.

The first two moneths passed, and no likelihood of rescue appeared; but yer the third moneth
was expired, the Englishmen being sent for to go with the king into Wales, raised their siege
and departed, leauing the noble men prisoners with the earle of Northumberland, and with his
sonne the lord Persie, [Sidenote: The professors of wicklifs doctrine.] to keepe them to the
kings vse. In this meane while, such as misliked with the doctrine and ceremonies then vsed
in the church, ceassed not to vtter their consciences, though in secret, to those in whome
they had affiance. But as in the like cases it commonlie hapneth, they were bewraied by some
that were thought chieflie to fauour their cause, as by sir Lewes Clifford knight, who hauing
leaned to the doctrine a long time, did now (as Thomas Walsingham writeth) disclose all that
he knew vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, to shew himselfe as it were to haue erred rather
of simplenesse and ignorance, than of frowardnesse or stubborn malice. The names of such as
taught the articles and conclusions mainteined by those which then they called Lollards or
heretikes, [Sidenote: Sir Lewes Clifford bewraieth his fellowes.] the said sir Lewes Clifford
gaue in writing to the said archbishop. Edmund Mortimer earle of March, prisoner with Owen
Glendouer, [Sidenote: The earle of March marieth the daughter of Owen Glendouer.] whether for
irksomnesse of cruell captiuitie, or feare of death, or for what other cause, it is vncerteine,
agréed to take part with Owen, against the king of England, and tooke to wife the daughter
of the said Owen.

Strange wonders happened (as men reported) at the natiuitie of this man, for the same night
he was borne, all his fathers horsses in the stable were found to stand in bloud vp to the
bellies. [Sidenote: Anno Reg. 4. A parlement.] The morow after the feast of saint Michaell,
a parlement began at Westminster, which continued the space of seauen weekes, in the same was
a tenth and a halfe granted by the cleargie, and a fiftéenth by the communaltie. Moreouer,
the commons in this parlement besought the king to haue the person of George earle of March
a Scotishman, [Sidenote: George earle of March recommended to the king by parlement.] recommended
to his maiestie, for that the same earle shewed himselfe faithfull to the king & his realme.
¶ There was also a statute made, [Sidenote: 1403.] [Sidenote: Ambassadors.] that the friers
beggers should not receiue any into their order, vnder the age of fourteene yeares. In this
fourth yeare of king Henries reigne, ambassadors were sent ouer into Britaine, to bring from
thence the duches of Britaine, the ladie Iane de Nauarre, the widow of Iohn de Montford, late
duke of Britaine, surnamed the conqueror, with whom by procurators the king had contracted
matrimonie. In the beginning of Februarie, those that were sent returned with hir in safetie,
but not without tasting the bitter stormes of the wind and weather, that tossed them sore to
and fro, before they could get to land. The king met hir at Winchester, where the seuenth of
Februarie, the marriage was solemnized betwixt them.

Whilest these things were thus in dooing in England, Waleran earl of saint Paule, bearing still
a deadlie and malicious hatred toward king Henrie, [Sidenote: The earle of saint Paule in the
Ile of Wight.] hauing assembled sixtéene or seuentéene hundred men of warre, imbarked them
at Harflew, and taking the sea, landed in the Ile of Wight, in the which he burned two villages,
and foure simple cotages, and for a triumph of so noble an act, made foure knignts. But when
he heard that the people of the Ile were assembled and approched to fight with him, he hasted
to his ships and returned home: wherewith the noble men of his companie were displeased, considering
his prouision to be great and his gaine small. [Sidenote: The earle of Cleremont in Gascoigne.]
In the same verie season, Iohn earle of Cleremont sonne to the duke of Bourbon, wan in Gascoigne
out of the Englishmens possession, the castels of saint Peter, saint Marie, and the New castell;
and the lord de la Bret wan the castell of Carlassin, which was no small losse to the English
nation.

Henrie earle of Northumberland, with his brother Thomas earle of Worcester, and his sonne the
lord Henrie Persie, surnamed Hotspur, which were to king Henrie in the beginning of his reigne,
both faithfull freends, and earnest aiders, began now to enuie his wealth and felicitie; and
especiallie they were gréeved, bicause the king demanded of the earle and his sonne such Scotish
prisoners as were taken at Homeldon and Nesbit: for of all the captiues which were taken in
the conflicts foughten in those two places, there was deliuered to the kings possession onlie
Mordake earle of Fife, the duke of Albanies sonne, though the king did diuers and sundrie times
require deliuerance of the residue, and that with great threatnings: wherewith the Persies
being sore offended, for that they claimed them as their owne proper prisoners, and their peculiar
preies, by the counsell of the lord Thomas Persie earle of Worcester, whose studie was euer
(as some write) to procure malice, and set things in a broile, [Sidenote: The request of the
Persies.] came to the king vnto Windsore (vpon a purpose to prooue him) and there required
of him, that either by ransome or otherwise, he would cause to be deliuered out of prison Edmund
Mortimer earle of March, their cousine germane, whome (as they reported) Owen Glendouer kept
in filthie prison, shakled with irons, onelie for that he tooke his part, and was to him faithfull
and true.

The king began not a little to muse at this request, and not without cause: for in déed it
touched him somewhat neere, sith this Edmund was sonne to Roger earle of March, sonne to the
ladie Philip, daughter of Lionell duke of Clarence, the third sonne of king Edward the third;
which Edmund at king Richards going into Ireland, was proclamed heire apparant to the crowne
and realme, whose aunt called Elianor, the lord Henrie Persie had married; and therefore king
Henrie could not well heare, that anie man should be in earnest about the aduancement of that
linage. The king when he had studied on the matter made answer that the earle of March was
not taken prisoner for his cause, nor in his seruice, but willinglie suffered himselfe to be
taken, bicause he would not withstand the attempts of Owen Glendouer and his complices, and
therefore he would neither ransome him, nor reléeue him.

The Persies with this answer and fraudulent excuse were not a little fumed, [Sidenote: The
saieng of the L. Persie.] insomuch that Henrie Hotspur said openlie: Behold, the heire of the
relme is robbed of his right, and yet the robber with his owne will not redeeme him. So in
this furie the Persies departed, minding nothing more than to depose king Henrie from the high
type of his roialtie, and to place in his seat their cousine Edmund earle of March, whom they
did not onlie deliuer out of captiuitie, [Sidenote: The conspiracies of the Persies with Owen
Glendouer.] but also (to the high displeasure of king Henrie) entered in league with the foresaid
Owen Glendouer. Héerewith, they by their deputies in the house of the archdeacon of Bangor,
[Sidenote: An indenture tripartite.] diuided the realme amongst them, causing a tripartite
indenture to be made and sealed with their seales, by the couenants whereof, [Sidenote: A diuision
of that which they had not.] all England from Seuerne and Trent, south and eastward, was assigned
to the earle of March: all Wales, & the lands beyond Seuerne westward, were appointed to Owen
Glendouer: and all the remnant from Trent northward, to the lord Persie.

[Sidenote: A vaine prophesie.] This was doone (as some haue said) through a foolish credit
giuen to a vaine prophesie, as though king Henrie was the moldwarpe, cursed of Gods owne mouth,
and they three were the dragon, the lion, and the woolfe, which should diuide this realme betwéene
them. Such is the deuiation (saith Hall) and not diuination of those blind and fantasticall
dreames of the Welsh prophesiers. King Henrie not knowing of this new confederacie, and nothing
lesse minding than that which after happened, gathered a great armie to go againe into Wales,
[Sidenote: The Persies raise their powers.] whereof the earle of Northumberland and his sonne
were aduertised by the earle of Worcester, and with all diligence raised all the power they
could make, [Sidenote: They craue aid of Scots.] and sent to the Scots which before were taken
prisoners at Homeldon, for aid of men, promising to the earle of Dowglas the towne of Berwike,
and a part of Northumberland, and to other Scotish lords great lordships and seigniories, if
they obteined the upper hand. The Scots in hope of gaine, and desirous to be reuenged of their
old greefes, came to the earle with a great companie well appointed.

[Sidenote: The archbish. of Yorke of counsell with the Persies in conspiracie.] The Persies
to make their part séeme good, deuised certeine articles, by the aduise of Richard Scroope,
archbishop of Yorke, brother to the lord Scroope, whome king Henrie had caused to be beheaded
at Bristow. [Sidenote: Thom. Wals.] These articles being shewed to diuerse noblemen, and other
states of the realme, mooued them to fauour their purpose, in so much that manie of them did
not onelie promise to the Persies aid and succour by words, but also by their writings and
seales confirmed the same. Howbeit when the matter came to triall, the most part of the confederates
abandoned them, and at the daie of the conflict left them alone. Thus after that the conspirators
had discouered themselues, the lord Henrie Persie desirous to procéed in the enterprise, vpon
trust to be assisted by Owen Glendouer, [Sidenote: The earle of Worchester gouernour to the
prince slippeth from him.] the earle of March, & other, assembled an armie of men of armes
and archers foorth of Cheshire and Wales. [Sidenote: Hall.] Incontinentlie his vncle Thomas
Persie earle of Worcester, that had the gouernement of the prince of Wales, who as then laie
at London in secret manner, conueied himselfe out of the princes house, and comming to Stafford
(where he met his nephue) they increased their power by all waies and meanes they could deuise.
The earle of Northumberland himselfe was not with them, but being sicke, had promised vpon
his amendement to repaire vnto them (as some write) with all conuenient spéed.

[Sidenote: The pretense of the Persies, as they published it abroad.] These noble men, to make
their conspiracie to séem excusable, besides the articles aboue mentioned, sent letters abroad,
wherein was conteined, that their gathering of an armie tended to none other end, but onlie
for the safegard of their owne persons, and to put some better gouernment in the commonwealth.
For whereas taxes and tallages were dailie leuied, vnder pretense to be imploied in defence
of the realme, the same were vainlie wasted, and vnprofitablie consumed: and where through
the slanderous reports of their enimies, the king had taken a greeuous displeasure with them,
they durst not appeare personallie in the kings presence, vntill the prelats and barons of
the realme had obteined of the king licence for them to come and purge themselues before him,
by lawfull triall of their péeres, whose iudgement (as they pretended) they would in no wise
refuse. Manie that saw and heard these letters, did commend their diligence, and highlie praised
their assured fidelitie and trustinesse towards the commonwealth.

But the king vnderstanding their cloaked drift, deuised (by what meanes he might) to quiet
and appease the commons, [Sidenote: The kings answer to the Persies libell.] and deface their
contriued forgeries; and therefore he wrote an answer to their libels, that he maruelled much,
sith the earle of Northumberland, and the lord Henrie Persie his sonne, had receiued the most
part of the summes of monie granted to him by the cleargie and communaltie, for defence of
the marches, as he could euidentlie prooue what should mooue them to complaine and raise such
manifest slanders. And whereas he vnderstood, that the earles of Northumberland and Worcester,
and the lord Persie had by their letters signified to their freends abroad, that by reason
of the slanderous reports of their enimies, they durst not appeare in his presence, without
the mediation of the prelats and nobles of the realme, so as they required pledges, whereby
they might safelie come afore him, to declare and alledge what they had to saie in proofe of
their innocencie, he protested by letters sent foorth vnder his seale, that they might safelie
come and go, without all danger, or anie manner of indamagement to be offered to their persons.

But this could not satisfie those men, but that resolued to go forwards with their enterprise,
they marched towards Shrewsburie, vpon hope to be aided (as men thought) by Owen Glendouer,
and his Welshmen, [Sidenote: Poore K. Richard is still aliue with thē that wish K. Henries
ouerthrow.] publishing abroad throughout the countries on each side, that king Richard was
aliue, whome if they wished to sée, they willed them to repaire in armour vnto the castell
of Chester, where (without all doubt) he was at that present, and redie to come forward. This
tale being raised, though it were most vntrue, yet it bred variable motions in mens minds,
causing them to wauer, so as they knew not to which part they should sticke; and verelie, diuers
were well affected towards king Richard, speciallie such as had tasted of his princelie bountifulnes,
of which there was no small number. And to speake a truth, no maruell it was, if manie enuied
the prosperous state of king Henrie, sith it was euident inough to the world, that he had with
wrong vsurped the crowne, and not onelie violentlie deposed king Richard, but also cruellie
procured his death; for the which vndoubtedlie, both he and his posteritie tasted such troubles,
as put them still in danger of their states, till their direct succeeding line was quite rooted
out by the contrarie faction, as in Henrie the sixt and Edward the fourth it may appeare.

But now to returne where we left. King Henrie aduertised of the proceedings of the Persies,
foorthwith gathered about him such power as he might make, and being earnestlie called vpon
by the Scot, the earle of March, to make hast and giue battell to his enimies, before their
power by delaieng of time should still too much increase, [Sidenote: The kings spéedie diligence.]
he passed forward with such spéed, that he was in sight of his enimies, lieng in campe néere
to Shrewesburie, before they were in doubt of anie such thing, for the Persies thought that
he would have staid at Burton vpon Trent, till his councell had come thither to him to giue
their aduise what he were best to doo.

[Sidenote: The Persies troubled with the kings sudden comming.] By reason of the kings sudden
cōming in this sort, they staied from assaulting the towne of Shrewesburie, [Sidenote: The
lord Persie exhorteth his complices to stick to their tackle.] which enterprise they were readie
at that instant to haue taken in hand, and foorth with the lord Persie (as a capteine of high
courage) began to exhort the capteines and souldiers to prepare themselues to battell, sith
the matter was growen to that point, that by no meanes it could be auoided, so that (said he)
this daie shall either bring vs all to aduancement & honor, or else if it shall chance vs to
be ouercome, shall deliuer vs from the kings spitefull malice and cruell disdaine: for plaieng
the men (as we ought to doo) better it is to die in battell for the commonwealths cause, than
through cowardlike feare to prolong life, which after shall be taken from vs, by sentence of
the enimie.

[Sidenote: The number of the Persies armie.] Herevpon, the whole armie being in number about
fourtéene thousand chosen men, promised to stand with him so long as life lasted. There were
with the Persies as chiefteines of this armie, the earle of Dowglas a Scotish man, the baron
of Kinderton, sir Hugh Browne, and sir Richard Vernon knights, with diuerse other stout and
right valiant capteins. [Sidenote: The Persies sent their articles to the king.] Now when the
two armies were incamped, the one against the other, the earle of Worcester and the lord Persie
with their complices sent the articles (whereof I spake before) by Thomas Caiton, and Thomas
Saluain esquiers to king Henrie, [Sidenote: King Henrie charged with periurie.] vnder their
hands and seales, which articles in effect charged him with manifest periurie, in that (contrarie
to his oth receiued vpon the euangelists at Doncaster, when he first entred the realme after
his exile) he had taken vpon him the crowne and roiall dignitie, imprisoned king Richard, caused
him to resigne his title, and finallie to be murthered. Diuerse other matters they laid to
his charge, as leuieng of taxes and tallages, contrarie to his promise, infringing of lawes
& customes of the realme, and suffering the earle of March to remaine in prison, [Sidenote:
Procurers & protectors of the commonwealth.] without trauelling to haue him deliuered. All
which things they as procurers & protectors of the common-wealth, tooke vpon them to prooue
against him, as they protested vnto the whole world.

[Sidenote: The kings answer to the messengers that brought the articles.] King Henrie after
he had read their articles, with the defiance which they annexed to the same, answered the
esquiers, that he was readie with dint of sword and fierce battell to prooue their quarrell
false, and nothing else than a forged matter, not doubting, but that God would aid and assist
him in his righteous cause, against the disloiall and false forsworne traitors. The next daie
in the morning earlie, being the euen of Marie Magdalene, they set their battels in order on
both sides, and now whilest the warriors looked when the token of battell should be giuen,
the abbat of Shrewesburie, [Sidenote: The king offereth to pardon his aduersaries.] and one
of the clearks of the priuie seale, were sent from the king vnto the Persies, to offer them
pardon, if they would come to any reasonable agréement. By their persuasions, the lord Henrie
Persie began to giue eare vnto the kings offers, & so sent with them his vncle the earle of
Worcester, to declare vnto the king the causes of those troubles, and to require some effectuall
reformation in the same.

It was reported for a truth, that now when the king had condescended vnto all that was resonable
at his hands to be required, [Sidenote: The earle of worchesters double dealing in wrong reporting
the kings words.] and seemed to humble himselfe more than was meet for his estate, the earle
of Worcester (vpon his returne to his nephue) made relation cleane contrarie to that the king
had said, in such sort that he set his nephues hart more in displeasure towards the king, than
euer it was before, driuing him by that meanes to fight whether he would or not: then suddenlie
blew the trumpets, the kings part crieng S. George vpon them, the aduersaries cried Esperance
Persie, and so the two armies furiouslie ioined. The archers on both sides shot for the best
game, laieng on such load with arrowes, that manie died, and were driuen downe that neuer rose
againe.

[Sidenote: Hall. The Scots.] The Scots (as some write) which had the fore ward on the Persies
side, intending to be reuenged of their old displeasures doone to them by the English nation,
set so fiercelie on the kings fore ward, led by the earle of Stafford, that they made the same
draw backe, and had almost broken their aduersaries arraie. The Welshmen also which before
had laine lurking in the woods, mounteines, and marishes, hearing of this battell toward, [Sidenote:
The welshmen comme to aid the Persies.] came to the aid of the Persies, and refreshed the wearied
people with new succours. The king perceiuing that his men were thus put to distresse, what
with the violent impression of the Scots, and the tempestuous stormes of arrowes, that his
aduersaries discharged fréely against him and his people, it was no need to will him to stirre:
for suddenlie with his fresh battell, he approached and relieued his men; so that the battell
began more fierce than before. Here the lord Henrie Persie, and the earle Dowglas, a right
stout and hardie capteine, not regarding the shot of the kings battell, nor the close order
of the ranks, pressing forward togither bent their whole forces towards the kings person, [Sidenote:
The earle of March. Tho. Walsin.] comming vpon him with speares and swords so fiercelie, that
the earle of March the Scot, perceiuing their purpose, withdrew the king from that side of
the field (as some write) for his great benefit and safegard (as it appeared) for they gaue
such a violent onset vpon them that stood about the kings standard, that slaieing his standard-bearer
sir Walter Blunt, and ouerthrowing the standard, they made slaughter of all those that stood
about it, as the earle of Stafford, that daie made by the king constable of the realme, and
diuerse other.

[Sidenote: Hall.] [Sidenote: The valiance of the yoong prince.] The prince that daie holpe
his father like a lustie yoong gentleman: for although he was hurt in the face with an arrow,
so that diuerse noble men that were about him, would haue conueied him foorth of the field,
yet he would not suffer them so to doo, least his departure from amongst his men might happilie
haue striken some feare into their harts: and so without regard of his hurt, he continued with
his men, [Sidenote: A sore battell & well mainteined.] & neuer ceassed, either to fight where
the battell was most hot, or to incourage his men where it séemed most néed. This battell lasted
thrée long houres, with indifferent fortune on both parts, till at length, the king crieng
saint George victorie, brake the arraie of his enimies, and aduentured so farre, [Sidenote:
The valiant dooings of the earle Dowglas.] that (as some write) the earle Dowglas strake him
downe, & at that instant slue sir Walter Blunt, and thrée other, apparelled in the kings sute
and clothing, saieng: I maruell to sée so many kings thus suddenlie arise one in the necke
of an other. The king in deed was raised, [Sidenote: The high manhood of the king.] & did that
daie manie a noble feat of armes, for as it is written, he slue that daie with his owne hands
six and thirtie persons of his enimies. The other on his part incouraged by his doings, [Sidenote:
The lord Persie slaine.] fought valiantlie, and slue the lord Persie, called sir Henrie Hotspurre.
To conclude, the kings enimies were vanquished, and put to flight, in which flight, the earle
of Dowglas, for hast, falling from the crag of an hie mounteine, [Sidenote: The earle Dowglas
taken prisoner.] brake one of his cullions, and was taken, and for his valiantnesse, of the
king frankelie and freelie deliuered.

[Sidenote: The earle of Worcester taken.] There was also taken the earle of Worcester, the
procuror and setter foorth of all this mischéefe, sir Richard Vernon, and the baron of Kinderton,
[Sidenote: Knights slaine on the kings part.] with diuerse other. There were slaine vpon the
kings part, beside the earle of Stafford, to the number of ten knights, sir Hugh Shorlie, sir
Iohn Clifton, sir Iohn Cokaine, sir Nicholas Gausell, sir Walter Blunt, sir Iohn Caluerleie,
sir Iohn Massie of Podington, sir Hugh Mortimer, and sir Robert Gausell, all the which receiued
the same morning the order of knighthood: sir Thomas Wendesleie was wounded to death, and so
passed out of this life shortlie after. There died in all vpon the kings side sixteene hundred,
and foure thousand were gréeuouslie wounded. On the contrarie side were slaine, besides the
lord Persie, the most part of the knights and esquiers of the countie of Chester, [Sidenote:
The slaughter of Cheshire men at this battell.] to the number of two hundred, besides yeomen
and footmen, in all there died of those that fought on the Persies side, about fiue thousand.
This battell was fought on Marie Magdalene euen, being saturdaie. [Sidenote: The earle of Worcester
and others beheaded.] Vpon the mondaie folowing, the earle of Worcester, the baron of Kinderton,
and sir Richard Vernon knights, were condemned and beheaded. The earles head was sent to London,
there to be set on the bridge.

The earle of Northumberland was now marching forward with great power, which he had got thither,
either to aid his sonne and brother (as was thought) or at least towards the king, [Sidenote:
The earle of westmerland raiseth a power against the earle of Northumberland.] to procure a
peace: but the earle of Westmerland, and sir Robert Waterton knight, had got an armie on foot,
and meant to meet him. The earle of Northumberland, taking neither of them to be his freend,
turned suddenlie back, and withdrew himselfe into Warkewoorth castell. [Sidenote: The king
goeth to Yorke.] The king hauing set a staie in things about Shrewesburie, went straight to
Yorke, from whence he wrote to the earle of Northumberland, willing him to dismisse his companies
that he had with him, [Sidenote: The earle of Northumberland commeth to the king.] and to come
vnto him in peaceable wise. The earle vpon receipt of the kings letters came vnto him the morow
after saint Laurence daie, hauing but a few of his seruants to attend him, and so excused himselfe,
that the king (bicause the earle had Berwike in his possession, and further, had his castels
of Alnewike, Warkewoorth, and other, fortified with Scots) dissembled the matter, gaue him
faire words, and suffered him (as saith Hall) to depart home, although by other it should séeme,
that he was committed for a time to safe custodie.

The king returning foorth of Yorkeshire, determined to go into Northwales, [Sidenote: The welshmen
molest the English subiects.] to chastise the presumptuous dooings of the vnrulie Welshmen,
who (after his comming from Shrewesburie, and the marches there) had doone much harme to the
English subiects. But now where the king wanted monie to furnish that enterprise, and to wage
his souldiers, there were some that counselled him to be bold with the bishops, and supplie
his want with their surplusage. But as it fortuned, the archbishop of Canturburie was there
present, who in the name of all the rest boldlie made answer, [Sidenote: It was spoken like
a prelat.] that none of his prouince should be spoiled by anie of those naughtie disposed persons;
but that first with hard stripes they should vnderstand the price of their rash enterprise.
But the king neuerthelesse so vsed the matter with the bishops for their good wils, [Sidenote:
A tenth leuied of the cleargie.] that the archbishop at length to pleasure him, calling the
cleargie togither, got a grant of a tenth, towards the kings necessarie charges.

The Britaines vnder the conduct of the lord of Cassils, spoiled and burnt the towne of Plimmouth,
and returned without receiuing anie damage, but immediatlie therevpon, the westerne men manning
foorth a fléet, [Sidenote: William Wilford.] vnder the gouernement of one William Wilford esquier,
[Sidenote: Ships taken.] made saile ouer to the coasts of Britaine, where they tooke aboue
fortie ships laden with oile, sope, and Rochell wine, to the quantitie of a thousand tunne,
or much thereabouts. In returning homewards, they burnt fortie other vessels, and landing at
Pennarch, they burnt townes and villages six leagues within the countrie, togither with the
towne of saint Matthew, and all the buildings there, thrée leagues round about the same towns.
[Sidenote: Anno Reg. 5. A parlement at Couentrie.] About the feast of All saints, a parlement
began at Couentrie, and continued there till saint Andrewes tide: but at length, bicause vittels
waxed déere, [Sidenote: Adiorned to London.] and lodging was streict, it was adiorned from
thence vnto London, there to begin againe in the octaues of the Epiphanie. [Sidenote: A pardon.]
The same time, a pardon was granted and proclamed, for all such as had taken part with the
Persies against the king, and likewise for other offenders, those excepted that had consented
to betraie Calis, [Sidenote: Frenchmen inuade the Ile of Wight.] whom the king sent thither
to suffer for their offences. A little before Christmas the Frenchmen meant to haue robbed
and spoiled the Ile of Wight, but when a thousand of them were set on land, and had got togither
a great bootie of cattell; suddenlie there came vpon them such number of people that they were
constrained to withdraw to their ships, leauing their preie behind them, [Sidenote: They are
repelled.] and no small number of their men to paie for their shot, so that they wan little
by that iournie, returning home with shame and dishonor.

[Sidenote: 1404.] [Sidenote: The parlement beginneth againe.] [Sidenote: The earle of Northumberland
restored.] This yeare in the parlement holden at London (beginning the morow after the feast
of saint Hilarie, and continuing twelue wéeks) the earl of Northumberland was restored vnto
his former dignities, [Sidenote: The Ile of Man.] lands and goods, the Ile of Man onlie excepted,
which by reason of the forfeiture made by the earle of Salisburie, the king had first giuen
vnto him, and now depriued him thereof, where all his other lands, possessions, and liuings
were wholie to him and his heires restored. [Sidenote: A subsidie.] By authoritie of the same
parlement a subsidie was also granted to the king, of euerie knights fée twentie shillings,
whether the same were holden of him by menaltie, or otherwise. Moreouer, euerie man and woman
that might dispend in lands the value of twentie shillings & so vpward, aboue the reprises,
whether the same lands belonged to the laie fee, or to the church, paied for euerie pound twelue
pence: and those that were valued to be woorth in goods twentie pounds and vpwards, [Sidenote:
Abr. Fl. out of Tho. Walsin. Hypod. pag. 164.] paid also after the rate of lands, that is,
twelue pence for euerie pound. ¶ This séemeth to be that subsidie which Thomas Walsingham calleth
a sore surcharging subsidie, or an vnaccustomed tax: the forme and maner wherof (saith he)
I had here interlaced, but that the verie granters and authors thereof had rather that the
posteritie should be vtterlie ignorant thereof, and neuer heare of it; sithens it was granted
vpon this condition, that hereafter it should not be drawne into example; neither might the
euidences thereof be kept in the kings treasurie, nor in the excheker; but the records thereof
presentlie (after the iust accounts giuen vp) burned; neither should writs or commissions be
sent abroad against the collectors or inquirers hereof for their better inquest.

[Sidenote: The Frenchmens demand of the Ile of Wight.] The Frenchmen about the same time came
before the Ile of Wight with a great nauie, and sent certeine of their men to the shore, to
demand in name of king Richard, and of his wife quéene Isabell, [Sidenote: The answer of the
Ilandmen.] a tribute or speciall subsidie in monie, of the inhabitants of that Ile; who answered,
that king Richard was dead, and queene Isabell sometime his wife had béene sent home to hir
parents and countrie, without condition of anie dowrie or tribute: wherefore, they answered
reasonablie, that none they would giue: but if the Frenchmen had desire to fight, they willed
them to come on land, and there should be none to resist them; and after they were on land,
they promised to giue them respit for six houres space to refresh themselues, and that time
being once expired, they should not faile to haue battell. When the Frenchmen heard of this
stout answer made by the Ilandmen, they had no lust to approch néere to the land, but returned
without further attempt.

[Sidenote: The duke of Orleance his challenge.] About this season, the duke of Orleance, brother
to the French king, a man of no lesse pride than hautinesse of courage, wrote letters to king
Henrie, aduertising him, that for the loue he bare to the noble feats of chiualrie, he could
imagine nothing either more honorable or cōmendable to them both, than to meet in the field
each part with an hundred knights and esquiers, all being gentlemen, both of name and armes,
armed at all points, and furnished with speares, axes, swords, and daggers, and there to fight
and combat to the yeelding; and euerie person, to whome God should send victorie, to haue his
prisoner, & him to ransome at his pleasure, offering himselfe with his companie to come to
his citie of Angulesme, so that the king would come to the lands of Burdeaux, and there defend
this challenge.

[Sidenote: The answer of king Henrie.] The king of England grauelie answered herevnto, that
he maruelled why the duke vnder colour of dooing déeds of armes for a vaine-glorie, would now
séeke to breake the peace betwixt the realmes of England and France, he being sworne to mainteine
same peace sith he might further vnderstand, that no king annointed, of verie dutie, was bound
to answer anie challenge, but to his péere of equall state and dignitie: and further declared,
that when opportunitie serued, he would passe the sea, and come into his countrie of Gascoigne,
with such companie as he thought conuenient, and then might the duke set forward with his band,
for the accomplishment of his couragious desire, promising him in the word of a prince, not
thence to depart, till the duke either by fulfilling his owne desire in manner aforesaid, or
by singular combat betwéene them two onelie, for auoiding of more effusion of Christian bloud,
should thinke himselfe fullie satisfied. To this and much more conteined in the kings answer,
the duke replied, and the king againe reioined, not without tawnts and checks vnfitting for
their estates. The duke of Orleance offended highlie (as he might séeme) furnished against
the king of England with an armie of six thousand men, entered into Guien, [Sidenote: The duke
of Orleance besiegeth Vergi in Guien.] and besieged the towne of Vergi, whereof was capteine
sir Robert Antlfield, a right hardie and valiant knight, hauing with him onelie thrée hundred
Englishmen, which defended the fortresse so manfullie, that the duke (after he had laine three
moneths) and lost manie of his men, without honour or spoile returned into France.

After this, the admerall of Britaine highlie incouraged, for that the last yeere he had taken
certeine English ships laden with wines, accompanied with the lord du Chastell, a valiant baron
of Britaine, and twelue hundred men of armes, sailed foorth with thirtie ships from S. Malos,
and came before the towne of Dartmouth, and would haue landed; [Sidenote: The lord du Chastell
slaine.] but by the puissance of the townesmen and aid of the countrie, they were repelled,
in the which conflict, the lord du Chastell, and two of his brethren, with foure hundred other
were slaine, and aboue two hundred taken prisoners and put to their ransoms, [Sidenote: Owen
Glendouer wasted the English marches.] amongst whom the lord of Baqueuille the marshall of
Britaine was one. All this summer, Owen Glendouer and his adherents, robbed, burned, and destroied
the countries adioining néere to the places where he hanted, and one while by sleight & guileful
policie, an other while by open force, he tooke and slue manie Englishmen, brake downe certeine
castels which he wan, and some he fortified and kept for his owne defense. Iohn Trenor bishop
of Assaph, considering with himselfe how things prospered vnder the hands of this Owen, fled
to him, and tooke his part against the king. About the same time, [Sidenote: Crueltie of the
Britains & Flemings.] the Britaines and the Flemings tooke certeine ships of ours laden with
merchandize, and slue all the mariners, or else hanged them.

[Sidenote: The countes of Oxford.] Also, the old countesse of Oxford, mother to Robert Veere
late duke of Ireland, that died at Louaine, caused certeine of hir seruants, and other such
as she durst trust, to publish and brute abroad, [Sidenote: K. Richard once againe aliue.]
thorough all the parts of Essex, that king Richard was aliue, and that he would shortlie come
to light, and claime his former estate, honor, and dignitie. She procured a great number of
harts to be made of siluer and gold, such as king Richard was woont to giue unto his knights,
esquiers, & fréends, to weare as cognizances, to the end that in bestowing them in king Richards
name, she might the sooner allure men to further hir lewd practises: and where the fame went
abroad, that king Richard was in Scotland with a great power of Frenchmen and Scots, readie
to come to recouer his realme, manie gaue the more light credit vnto this brute thus set foorth
by the said countesse.

[Sidenote: Serlo one of K. Richard’s chamber.] The persuasions also of one Serlo, that in times
past was one of king Richards chamber, greatlie increased this errour, for the same Serlo,
hearing in France (whither he was fled) that his maister king Richard was in Scotland aliue,
conueied himselfe thither, to vnderstand the truth of that matter, and finding there one indeed
that greatlie resembled him in all lineaments of bodie, but yet was not the man himselfe (as
he well perceiued) vpon malice that he bare to king Henrie, aduertised by letters sent vnto
diuerse of king Richards freends, that he was aliue indéed, and shortlie would come to shew
himselfe openlie to the world, when he had once made his waie readie to recouer his kingdome,
to the confusion of his enimies, and comfort of his fréends. These forged inuentions caused
manie to beleeue the brute raised by the countesse of Oxford, for the which they came in trouble,
were apprehended and committed to prison. The countesse hir selfe was shut vp in close prison,
[Sidenote: The countesse of Oxford committed to prison.] and all hir goods were confiscat,
and hir secretarie drawen and hanged, that had spred abroad this fained report, in going vp
and downe the countrie, blowing into mens eares that king Richard was aliue, [Sidenote: Hir
secretary executed.] & affirming that he had spoken with him in such a place and in such a
place, apparelled in this raiment and that raiment, with such like circumstances.

[Sidenote: The earle of Northumberland cōmeth to the king.] About the feast of saint Iohn Baptist,
at the kings commandement, the earle of Northumberland came to Pomfret, and brought with him
his nephues, and his nephues sonnes, whereby he cleared himselfe of a great deale of suspicion,
manie doubting before his comming that he had given euill counsell to the yoong men, whereby
to mooue them to rebellion, [Sidenote: Sir William Clifford bringeth Serlo to the king.] and
to withstand the king. Sir William Clifford also came with the earle, and brought the foresaid
Serlo with him, whom he had apprehended vpon his comming to him at Berwike, in hope to haue
found succour at his hands; in consideration whereof the king pardoned the said sir William
Clifford of his disobedience shewed, in keeping the castell of Berwike against him, in which
dooing he had committed manifest treason.

[Sidenote: Serlo examined for the duke of Glocesters death.] This Serlo being knowen to be
the man that had béene the chiefe murtherer of the duke of Glocester, when he was made awaie
at Calis, was diligentlie examined who were helpers with him in the execution thereof, and
after what sort they made him awaie: Serlo knowing there was no waie with him but death, would
not vtter any other, but confessed for his owne part, he was worthie for that wicked déed to
die ten thousand deaths, and shewed such outward appearance of repentance, that manie sore
lamented his case, and promised to hire priests to sing masses, (as the manner was) for his
soule, of their owne costs and charges. [Sidenote: He is drawen through euery goode towne.]
He was condemned to die at Pomfret, and was drawen from thence through euerie good towne, [Sidenote:
He is executed at Lōdon.] through which those that had the conueiance of him passed with him
till they came to London, where he was executed, confessing euerie thing to be true concerning
his wicked pretense, as before is recited: and further, that when he perceiued how their counterfeit
practise would come to light and be openlie reuealed, he meant to haue returned into France,
but wanting monie, he thought to have béene relieued with some portion at the hand of the said
sir William Clifford, and this caused him to come vnto Berwike, to shew him his necessitie,
who to make his owne peace, did apprehend him, and present him to the king, as before ye haue
heard.

[Sidenote: Anno Reg. 6.] King Henrie wanting monie in the feast of saint Faith the virgine,
assembled at Couentrie his high court of parlement, in the which, the lord Stephan Scroope
of Masham, and the lord Henrie Fitz Hugh obteined first to haue places of barons. [Sidenote:
The leymens parlement.] Moreouer, it is to be noted, that this was called The laie mans parlement,
bicause the shiriffes were appointed to haue a speciall regard, that none should be chosen
knights for the counties, nor burgesses for the cities and townes, that had any skill in the
lawes of the land. This was doone, and when they came togither to talke of the weightie affaires
of the realme, speciallie how the king might be relieued with monie, to beare such charges
as he was knowen to be at, as well in defending the realme from the Scots and Welshmen at home,
as from the Britains, [Sidenote: Strife betwixt the laitie and spiritualtie.] Flemings, and
Frenchmen abroad, it was thought most expedient, that the spiritualtie should be depriued of
their temporall possessions, to the reliefe of the kings necessitie. Herevpon rose great altercation
betwixt the cleargie and the laitie; the knights affirming, that they had oftentimes serued
the king, not onelie with their goods, but also with their persons in great dangers and ieopardies,
[Sidenote: The archbishop of Canterburie answereth for his brethren.] whilest the spiritualtie
sat at home, and holp the king nothing at all. Thomas Arundell, archbishop of Canturburie stoutlie
answered herevnto, that the cleargie had alwaie giuen to the king as much as the laitie had
doone, considering they had oftener giuen their tenths to him than the laitie their fiftéens:
also, that more of their tenants went foorth into the kings warres, than the tenants of them
of the laie fée: beside this, they praied day and night for the kings good successe against
his enimies.

[Sidenote: Sir Iohn Cheinie speaker of the parlement.] When the speaker named sir Iohn Cheinie,
in replieng by plaine speach, séemed little to esteeme such praiers of the church, the archbishop
was set in a great chafe, and with sharpe words declaring what he thought must needs follow,
both of the king and kingdome, when praiers and suffrages of churchmen came to be so little
set by, he grew to such impatiencie, that he flatlie told the speaker, [Sidenote: The archb.
chafeth.] that although he séemed little to estéeme of the religion of the cleargie, he would
not haue him to thinke, that he should take awaie the possessions of the church, [Sidenote:
He spake like a lord.] without finding such as would seeke to withstand him, for if (said he)
the archbishop of Canturburie maie liue, thou shalt haue hot taking awaie any manner of thing
that is his. After this, when the archbishop perceiued that the king winked at these matters,
he rose from his place and comming before the king, knéeled downe, and besought him to consider,
how through the fauour and grace of the almightie God, he had atteined to the kingdome, and
therefore he ought to remember his first purpose and intent, which was, to saue vnto euerie
man his right, so far as in him laie.

He willed him likewise to haue in consideration the oth which he willinglie had receiued, that
is, that he should aduance the honor of the church, and the ministers thereof cherish and mainteine.
Also, to haue in mind the danger and dishonour that redounded to such as brake their othes:
so that he besought him to permit and suffer the church to inioy the priuileges and liberties,
which in time of his predecessors it had inioied, requesting him to stand in awe of that king,
by whom all kings did reigne; and to feare the censures and condemnation that those incurred,
which tooke and bereft from the church any good or right belonging to it, who most certeinelie
(said he) are accursed. [Sidenote: The kings answer to the archbishop.] When the archbishop
had vsed this, or the like speach, the king commanded him to go to his seat againe, assuring
him, that his intent and purpose was to leaue the church in as good state, or better, than
he found it.

The archbishop herewith turning to the knights and burgesses of the parlement, said vnto them;
“You, and such other as you be, haue giuen counsell vnto the king and his predecessors, to
confiscate and take into their hands the goods and possessions of the celles, which the Frenchmen
and Normans possessed here in England, and affirmed that by the same he and they should heape
vp great riches, and indéed those goods and possessions (as is to be prooued) were worth manie
thousands of gold; and yet it is most true, that the king at this day is not halfe one marke
of siluer the richer thereby, for you haue begged and gotten them out of his hands, and haue
appropriated the same vnto your selves, so that we may coniecture verie well, that you request
to haue our temporalties, not to aduance the kings profit, but to satisfie your owne greedie
covetousnesse, for vndoubtedlie if the king (as God forbid he should) did accomplish your wicked
purposes and minds, he should not be one farthing the richer the yeare next after: and trulie,
sooner will I suffer this head of mine to be cut off from my shoulders, than that the church
should lose the least right that apperteineth to it.”

The knights said little, but yet they procéeded in their sute to haue their purpose forward,
which the archbishop perceiuing (as an other Argus, hauing his eie on each side, to marke what
was doone) laboured so to disappoint their dooings, that he wan the favour of certeine of the
temporall lords to assist him, who constantlie auouched by their consents, that the church
should neuer be spoiled of the temporalties, and herein they acquited the archbishop and prelats,
one pleasure for an other, which they had doone for them before, when the commons in this parlement
required, that all such lands and reuenues as sometime belonged to the crowne, and had béene
giuen awaie, either by the king, or by his predecessors king Edward, and king Richard, should
be againe restored to the kings vse; vnto which request, the archbishop and other the prelats
would in no wise consent: [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Walsi. Hypod. pag. 167.] thus by
the stout diligence of the archbishop Arundell that petition of the commons, touching the spiritual
temporalties, came to none effect. [Yea the knights themselues, who verie instantlie had stood
in this error, acknowledging their maliciousness & guiltinesse herein, besought the archbishop
of Canturburie to pardon them; and gaue thanks that by his couragiousnesse the church in this
so troublesome a time reuiued, calling to mind the saieing of an ethnike, by way of application,
to the said archbishops his praise:

  -------sub principe duro
  Temporibúsq; malis ausus es esse bonus.]

[Sidenote: Two fiftéens granted.] Two fiftéens were granted by the commons, with condition,
that the same should be paid vnto the hands of the lord Furniuall, who should sée that monie
imploied for maintenance of the kings warres. Moreouer, [Sidenote: Letters patents reuoked.]
at the importunate sute of the commons, the letters patents that had béene made to diuerse
persons of annuities to them granted by king Edward and king Richard, [Sidenote: A tenth and
a halfe granted by the cleargie.] were called in and made void, not without some note of dishonor
to the king. The cleargie granted to the king a tenth and a halfe, notwithstanding that the
halfe of one tenth latelie granted was yet behind, and appointed to be paid vpon saint Martins
daie now next comming. About this season, great losse happened in Kent, by breaking in of waters,
[Sidenote: Ouerflowing of the sea.] that ouerflowed the sea banks, as well in the archbishop
of Canturburies grounds, as other mens, whereby much cattell was drowned. Neither did England
alone bewaile her losses by such breakings in of the sea, but also Zealand, Flanders, & Holland
tasted of the like damage.

[Sidenote: The death of Williā Wickham.] William Wickham bishop of Winchester, being a man
of great age, deceassed this yeare, leauing behind him a perpetuall memorie of his name, for
the notable monuments which he erected, in building two colleges, one at Winchester for grammarians,
and the other at Oxenford called the new college, purchasing lands and reuenues for the maintenance
of students there, to the great commoditie of the commonwealth: for from thence, as out of
a good nursserie, haue come foorth diuerse men in all ages excellentlie learned in all sciences.
¶ And héere I haue not thought it impertinent to speake somewhat of this worthie prelat (considering
that by him so great a benefit hath returned to the commonwealth) according to such notes as
I haue séene collected by that painfull traueller in search of antiquities Iohn Leland, who
saith, that as some haue supposed, the said Wickham, otherwise called Perot, was base sonne
to one Perot, the towne-clerke of Wickham in Hampshire, of which place he tooke his surname,
and that one maister Wodall a gentleman, dwelling in the said towne, brought him vp at schoole,
where he learned his grammar, and to write verie faire, in so much that the constable of Winchester
castell, a great ruler in those daies in Hampshire, got him of maister Wodall, and reteined
him to be his secretaire, with whome he continued, till king Edward the third, comming to Winchester,
conceiued some good liking of the yoong man, and tooke him to his seruice, and withall vnderstanding
that he was minded to be a churchman, he first made him parson and deane of saint Martins in
London, then archdeacon of Buckingham.

But for so much as his seruice was right acceptable to the king, as he that with great dexteritie
could handle such affaires of the state, or other matters of charge as were committed to his
hands, the king still kept him about his person, as one of his chéefe chapleins of houshold,
and imploied him in sundrie offices, as occasions serued: and first he made him surueior of
his works and buildings, namelie at Windsore, in reparing of that castell, and also at Quinburrough,
where, by the kings appointment, a strong fortresse was raised, for defence of the realme on
that side. [Sidenote: He was also at one time treasurer of England (as Leland gathereth.)]
After this, he was aduanced to the kéeping of the priuie seale, made ouerséer of the wards
and forrests, also treasuror of the kings reuenues in France, and at length was made bishop
of Winchester. Yet the Blacke prince did not greatlie fauour him, wherevpon Wickham procured
to kéepe him occupied in warres beyond the seas. But at length Iohn duke of Lancaster, and
Alice Perers king Edwards concubine, conceiuing some great displeasure against him, found meane
to procure the king to banish him the realme, and then he remained in Normandie and Picardie
for the space of seauen yeares, or thereabout, and might not be restored so long as king Edward
liued. But after his deceasse, about the second yeare of king Richard the seconds reigne, he
was restored home, and purchased a general pardon for all matters past that might be surmized
against him, or laid to his charge.

Afterwards he bare himselfe so uprightlie in that dangerous time, when such misliking and priuie
enuie reigned betwixt the king and his nobles, that both parts séemed to like of him, insomuch
that when the king made him lord chancellor, there was not anie that greatlie repined thereat;
and verelie in that the king made choise of him before others to occupie that place, it argueth
there was not so euill a disposition in the king, nor lacke of discretion in order of gouernment,
as writers seeme to charge him with. But where other could not so well beare iniuries at others
hands as happilie Wickham could, the fire of dissention cheeflie kindled thereof. For if the
duke of Ireland, and the earle of Suffolke, with those of that faction could haue refrained
to shew their displeasures, when the duke of Glocester and other his complices pinched at them
(for that they saw the king haue them in more estimation than they wished) matters might haue
béene qualified peraduenture with lesse adoo, and without danger to haue insued to either part.
But howsoeuer it went with them, it may doubtlesse be easilie coniectured, that Wickham was
a man of singular wisedome, and politike forecast, that could from meane degrée in such wise
clime aloft, and afterwards passe through the chances and changes of variable fortune, kéeping
himselfe euer so in state, that he grew at length to be able to furnish the chargeable expenses
of two such notable foundations which he left behind him, to make his name immortall. But leauing
the consideration hereof to others, I will returne to the purpose from whence I haue thus far
stepped.

[Sidenote: 1405.] [Sidenote: The earle of Marches sonnés. Thom. Walsin.] In this sixt yeare,
the fridaie after saint Valentines daie, the earle of March his sonnes earlie in the morning
were taken foorth of Windsore castell, and conueied awaie, it was not knowne whither at the
first, but such search and inquirie was made for them that shortlie after they were heard of,
and brought backe againe. The smith that counterfeited the keies, by the which they that conueied
them thence got into the chamber where they were lodged, [Sidenote: The ladie Spenser cōmitted
to ward.] had first his hands cut off, and after his head striken from his shoulders. The ladie
Spenser, sister to the duke of Yorke and widow of the lord Thomas Spenser, executed at Bristow
(as before yee haue heard) being apprehended and committed to close prison, [Sidenote: She
accuseth hir brother the duke of Yorke.] accused hir brother the duke of Yorke, as chéefe authour
in stealing awaie the said earle of March his sonnes. And further, that the said duke ment
to haue broken into the manor of Eltham the last Christmasse, by scaling the wals in the night
season, the king being there the same time, to the intent to haue murthered him. For to prooue
hir accusation true she offered that if there were anie knight, or esquier, that would take
vpon him to fight in hir quarrell, if he were ouercome, she would be content to be burnt for it.

[Sidenote: Williā Maidstone esquier offred to fight in his ladies quarrell.] One of hir esquiers
named William Maidstone, hearing what answer his ladie and mistresse propounded, cast downe
his hood, and proffered in hir cause the combat. The duke likewise cast downe his hood, readie
by battell to cleare his innocencie. But yet the kings sonne lord Thomas of Lancaster arrested
him, and put him vnder safe kéeping in the Tower, till it were further knowne what order should
be taken with him, [Sidenote: The earle marshall accused.] and in the meane time were all his
goods confiscate. The same time was Thomas Mowbraie earle marshall accused, as priuie to the
purpose of the duke of Yorke, touching the withdrawing of the earle of March his children,
who confessed indéed that he knew of the dukes purpose: but yet in no wise gaue his consent
therevnto, and therefore besought the king to be good and gratious lord vnto him for concealing
the matter, and so he obteined pardon of that offense.

The king had assembled at the same time the most part of the nobilitie at London, to consult
with them for diuerse weightie matters, concerning the state of the common-wealth, and about
some aid of monie which he required: [Sidenote: The k. wanteth monie & can get none of the
lords.] but the lords shewed themselues not willing to satisfie his request. He therefore caused
the spirituall lords as well as the temporall, to méet at S. Albons in the Lent season, about
the same matter; but yet obteined not his purpose, by reason the barons were sore against him,
and so at length on Palme sundaie they went their waie, each man to his home, hauing gratified
the king in nothing concerning his demand. In the meane time, to wit the fiftéenth of March
at a place in Wales called Huske, in a conflict fought betwixt the Welshmen and certeine of
the princes companie, the sonne of Owen Glendouer was taken, and fiftéene hundred Welshmen
taken and slaine. Also in Maie about the feast daie of S. Dunstane, was the chancellor of the
said Owen taken prisoner, and a great number of other taken and slaine. The prisoners were
brought vp to London, where the chancellor was commited to safe keeping in the Tower.

[Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Wals. Hypod. pag. 159.] ¶ This was a shrewd discomfiture to
the Welsh by the English, on whome sinister lot lowred, at such time as more than a thousand
of them were slaine in a hot skirmish; and such shamefull villanie executed vpon the carcasses
of the dead men by the Welshwomen; [Sidenote: Iust. lib. 1. Herod. lib. 1. Val. Max. lib. 8.
cap. 7.] as the like (I doo belieue) hath neuer or sildome beene practised. For though it was
a cruell déed of Tomyris quéene of the Massagets in Scythia, against whome when Cyrus the great
king of Persia came, and had slaine hir sonne, she by hir policie trained him into such streicts,
that she slue him and all his host; and causing a great vessel to be filled with the bloud
of Cyrus and other Persians, did cast his head thereinto, saieng; Bloud thou hast thirsted
and now drinke thereof thy fill: againe, though it was a cruell déed of Fuluia the wife of
Marcus Antonius (at whose commandement Popilius cut off the head and hands of that golden mouthed
orator Tullie, which afterwards were nailed vp ouer the place of common plées at Rome) to hold
in her hands the toong of that father of eloquence cut out of his head after the same was parted
from his shoulders, and to pricke it all ouer with pins and néedels: yet neither the crueltie
of Tomyris nor yet of Fuluia is comparable to this of the Welshwomen; which is worthie to be
recorded to the shame of a sex pretending the title of weake vessels, and yet raging with such
force of fiercenesse and barbarisme. For the dead bodies of the Englishmen, being aboue a thousand
lieng vpon the ground imbrued in their owne bloud, was a sight (a man would thinke) greeuous
to looke vpon, and so farre from exciting and stirring vp affections of crueltie; that it should
rather haue mooued the beholders to commiseration and mercie: yet did the women of Wales cut
off their priuities, and put one part thereof into the mouthes of euerie dead man, in such
sort that the cullions hoong downe to their chins; and not so contented, they did cut off their
noses and thrust them into their tailes as they laie on the ground mangled and defaced. This
was a verie ignominious déed, and a woorsse not committed among the barbarous: which though
it make the reader to read it, and the hearer to heare it, ashamed: yet bicause it was a thing
doone in open sight, and left testified in historie; I see little reason whie it should not
be imparted in our mother toong to the knowledge of our owne countrimen, as well as vnto strangers
in a language vnknowne. And thus much by waie of notifieng the inhumanitie and detestable demeanour
of those Welshwomen, after the conflict betwéene the English and the Welsh, whereof desultorie
mention is made before pag. 520, where Edmund Mortimer earle of March was taken prisoner.

Valeran earle of S. Paule, by the assent of the French king, assembled fiue hundred men of
armes, fiue hundred Genowaies with crossebowes, [Sidenote: The castell of Marke besieged about
the middest of Maie as Iac. Meir. saith. Sir Philip Hall.] and a thousand Flemings on foot,
with the which he laid siege to the castell of Marke, thrée leagues from Calis, vpon the fiftéenth
daie of Iulie. Capteine of the castell as then for the king of England was one sir Philip Hall,
hauing with him foure score archers, and four and twentie other soldiers, which defended the
place so manfullie, that the earle retired into the towne, and there lodged, fortifieng it
for feare of rescue that might come from Calis. The next daie he gaue an other assault to the
castell, and tooke the vtter court, wherin was found a great number of horsses, kine, and other
cattell. The next daie there issued foorth of Calis two hundred men of armes, two hundred archers,
and three hundred footmen, with ten or twelue wagons laden with vittels and artillerie, conducted
by sir Richard Aston knight, lieutenant of the English pale for the earle of Summerset, capteine
generall of those marches.

The Frenchmen aduertised that the Englishmen were comming to remooue the siege, issued not
foorth of their lodgings, but kept them within their closure. Neuerthelesse, the Englishmen
shot so sharpelie and closelie togither, that the Flemings and footmen began to flie: the men
of armes fearing the slaughter of their horsses, ran awaie with a light gallop. The Genowaies
which had spent the most part of their shot at the assaults made to the castell, shewed small
resistance, [Sidenote: The earle of S. Paule put to flight. Ia. Meir.] and so all the number
of the French part were slaine and put to flight. The earle of S. Paule and diuerse other escaped
awaie, and by S. Omers got to Therouenne, or (as others saie) to saint Omers. But there were
taken to the number of thrée or foure score, and amongst other the lord de Dampier seneshall
of Ponthien, monsieur de Weriners, monsieur de Vineles, monsieur de Noielles, monsieur Iohn
de Hangests capteine of Bullongne, the lord de Rambures, monsieur Lionell Darreis capteine
of Graueling, monsieur Peter Rasser capteine of Arde, also Combernard capteine of Tirouan,
Boid Chanon capteine of Montoire, Iohn Chanon capteine of Lisle, Stenebecke capteine of Ralingham,
the bastard of Burneuill capteine of Burburgh. There were slaine about 60, and among them as
cheefe sir Robert Berengueuill, the lord of Quercus, Morell de Saucuses, the lord Courbet de
Rempeupret, and others.

The Englishmen had the spoile of the earls campe, and being returned to Calis, within fiue
daies after there issued foorth about fiue hundred men meaning to haue woone the towne of Arde
with a sudden assault, [Sidenote: Arde assaulted by Englishmen.] which they gaue to it in the
night time. But sir Manfrid de Bois, and the lord Rigine, did so valiantlie defend it, that
the Englishmen with losse of fortie of their men were constreined to returne vnto Calis, after
they had burnt the dead bodies in an old house, for that the enimies should not perceiue what
losse the Englishmen had susteined. After this, the French king, to auoid perils, laid in garison
at Bullongne, and in other places, the marques of Pount, sonne to the duke of Bar, the earle
of Dampnie, [Sidenote: The marques du Pount.] and sir Iohn Harpadan a knight of great renowne
and estimation. The duke of Burgognie likewise sent a number of soldiers vnto Graueling, vnder
the leading of one Iohn Vandenwall, and to other fortresses alongst the coast he sent new supplies,
for doubt of the Englishmens inuasions.

[Sidenote: An armie sent to Calis and to the sea.] The king of England in deed hearing of the
preparation made for warre by the Frenchmen, leuied foure thousand men which he sent vnto Calis,
and to the sea, of the which 3000 were vnder the conduct of the kings sonne. [Sidenote: Chr.
Fland. Ia. Meir. The English men besieged the castell of Sluis.] The lord Thomas of Lancaster,
and the earle of Kent, the two and twentith daie of Maie (as some write) came vpon the coast
of Flanders, and entring the hauen of Sluis, burnt foure great ships which they found there
lieng at anchor. On the fift daie after their comming into that hauen they went on land, thinking
to haue fought with the duke of Burgognie. But as other write, after they had besieged the
castell that stood in the mouth of the hauen, and loosing thrée score of their men, amongst
which they name one to beare the title of earle of Penbroke (whom they buried for the time
in the church of Mude) fiue daies after their comming thither they determined to depart from
thence, perceiuing the castell would not easilie be woone, but first they spoiled the countrie
about them, and burnt Heis fléet, otherwise called Condekirke, and diuerse other places thereabout.

This doone, they tooke vp the bodie of him whom the Flemish writers call the earle of Penbroke,
and got them againe to the sea, for that they were aduertised how the duke of Burgognie meant
to besiege Calis. Wherevpon raising their siege thus from Sluis castell, they returned vnto
the defense of the towne of Calis, so much desired of the French nation. As they returned homewards,
they met with three caricks of Genoa, of the which one hauing the wind with hir, meant to haue
ouerthrowne the ship wherein the lord Thomas of Lancaster was aboord: but by the good foresight
of the master of the ship that ruled the sterne, suddenlie turning the same, the violent swaie
of that huge vessell comming so vpon them, was auoided; but yet the caricke stroke off the
nose of the English ship, and brused hir on the side. Then began the fight verie cruell, till
the earle of Kent came to the rescue: [Sidenote: A great fight by sea.] and so finallie after
a great conflict and bloudie battell betwixt the caricks and English ships, [Sidenote: Thre
caricks are taken.] the victorie remained with the Englishmen, [Sidenote: Townes in Normandie
burnt.] who taking the caricks, turned their sailes towards Normandie, where they arriued and
burnt the townes of Hoggue, Mountburge, Berflie, saint Petronils and other, to the number of
thirtie six, passing foorth into the countrie without resistance, the space of thirtie miles,
spoiling all that came in their waie. This doone, they returned, and brought the caricks into
the chamber at Rie, where one of them by misfortune of fire perished, to the losse & no gaine
of either of the parties.

[Sidenote: The duke of Burgognie prepareth to besiege Calis.] Iohn duke of Burgognie hauing
obteined licence to besiege Calis, prepared an armie of six thousand men of armes, fiftéene
hundred crosbowes, & twelue thousand footmen, the which being assembled, and all necessarie
prouision readie at saint Omers, he was by the French king countermanded, and not suffered
to proceed anie further in that weightie enterprise. [Sidenote: The chéefe root of the malice
betwixt the dukes of Burgognie & Orleance.] And this was thought to be partlie the cause of
the malice that he conceiued against the duke of Orleance, supposing that through him (enuieng
his glorie) he was thus disappointed of his purpose. Whilest such dooings were in hand betwixt
the English and French, as the besieging of Marke castell by the earle of saint Paule, and
the sending foorth of the English fléet, vnder the gouernance of the lord Thomas of Lancaster,
and the earle of Kent, the king was minded to haue gone into Wales against the Welsh rebels,
that vnder their chéefteine Owen Glendouer, ceassed not to doo much mischéefe still against
the English subiects.

But at the same time, to his further disquieting, [Sidenote: A new cōspiracie against king
Henrie by the earle of Northumberland & others.] there was a conspiracie put in practise against
him at home by the earle of Northumberland, who had conspired with Richard Scroope archbishop
of Yorke. Thomas Mowbraie earle marshall sonne to Thomas duke of Norfolke, who for the quarrell
betwixt him and king Henrie had béene banished (as ye haue heard) the lords Hastings, Fauconbridge,
Berdolfe, and diuerse others. It was appointed that they should meet altogither with their
whole power, vpon Yorkeswold, at a daie assigned, and that the earle of Northumberland should
be cheefteine, promising to bring with him a great number of Scots. The archbishop accompanied
with the earle marshall, deuised certeine articles of such matters, as it was supposed that
not onelie the commonaltie of the Realme, but also the nobilitie found themselues gréeued with:
which articles they shewed first vnto such of their adherents as were néere about them, & after
sent them abroad to their fréends further off, assuring them that for redresse of such oppressions,
they would shed the last drop of blood in their bodies, if néed were.

[Sidenote: The archbishop of yorke one of the chéefe conspirators.] The archbishop not meaning
to staie after he saw himselfe accompanied with a great number of men, that came flocking to
Yorke to take his part in this quarrell, foorthwith discouered his enterprise, causing the
articles aforesaid to be set vp in the publike stréets of the citie of Yorke, and vpon the
gates of the monasteries, that ech man might vnderstand the cause that mooued him to rise in
armes against the king, the reforming whereof did not yet apperteine vnto him. Herevpon knights,
esquiers, gentlemen, yeomen, and other of the commons, as well of the citie, townes and countries
about, being allured either for desire of change, or else for desire to see a reformation in
such things as were mentioned in the articles, [Sidenote: The archbishop in armor.] assembled
togither in great numbers; and the archbishop comming foorth amongst them clad in armor, incouraged,
exhorted, and (by all meanes he could) pricked them foorth to take the enterprise in hand,
and manfullie to continue in their begun purpose, promising forgiuenesse of sinnes to all them,
whose hap it was to die in the quarrell: and thus not onelie all the citizens of Yorke, but
all other in the countries about, that were able to beare weapon, came to the archbishop, and
the earle marshall. [Sidenote: The estimation which men had of the archbishop of Yorke.] In
déed the respect that men had to the archbishop, caused them to like the better of the cause,
since the grauitie of his age, his integritie of life, and incomparable learning, with the
reuerend aspect of his amiable personage, mooued all men to haue him in no small estimation.

The king aduertised of these matters, meaning to preuent them, left his iournie into Wales,
and marched with all spéed towards the north parts. [Sidenote: The earl of westmerland and
the lord Iohn of Lancaster the kings sonne prepare themselues to resist the kings enimies.]
Also Rafe Neuill earle of Westmerland, that was not farre off, togither with the lord Iohn
of Lancaster the kings sonne, being informed of this rebellious attempt, assembled togither
such power as they might make, and together with those which were appointed to attend on the
said lord Iohn to defend the borders against the Scots, as the lord Henrie Fitzhugh, the lord
Rafe Eeuers, the lord Robert Umfreuill, & others, [Sidenote: The forest of Galtree.] made forward
against the rebels, and comming into a plaine within the forrest of Galtree, caused their standards
to be pitched downe in like sort as the archbishop had pitched his, ouer against them, being
farre stronger in number of people than the other, for (as some write) there were of the rebels
at the least twentie thousand men.

[Sidenote: The subtill policie of the earle of westmerland.] When the earle of Westmerland
perceiued the force of the aduersaries, and that they laie still and attempted not to come
forward vpon him, he subtillie deuised how to quaile their purpose, and foorthwith dispatched
messengers vnto the archbishop to vnderstand the cause as it were of that great assemblie,
[Sidenote: The archbishops protestation why he had on him armes.] and for what cause (contrarie
to the kings peace) they came so in amour. The archbishop answered, that he tooke nothing in
hand against the kings peace, but that whatsoeuer he did, tended rather to aduance the peace
and quiet of the common-wealth, than otherwise; and where he and his companie were in armes,
it was for feare of the king, to whom he could haue no free accesse, by reason of such a multitude
of flatterers as were about him; and therefore he mainteined that his purpose to be good &
profitable, as well for the king himselfe, as for the realme, if men were willing to vnderstand
a truth: & herewith he shewed foorth a scroll, in which the articles were written wherof before
ye haue heard.

The messengers returning to the earle of Westmerland, shewed him what they had heard & brought
from the archbishop. When he had read the articles, he shewed in word and countenance outwardly
that he liked of the archbishops holie and vertuous intent and purpose, promising that he and
his would prosecute the same in assisting the archbishop, who reioising hereat, gaue credit
to the earle, and persuaded the earle marshall (against his will as it were) to go with him
to a place appointed for them to commune togither. Here when they were met with like number
on either part, the articles were read ouer, and without anie more adoo, the earle of Westmerland
and those that were with him agréed to doo their best, to see that a reformation might be had,
according to the same.

[Sidenote: The earle of westmerlāds politike dealing.] The earle of Westmerland vsing more
policie then the rest: “Well (said he) then our trauell is come to the wished end: and where
our people haue beene long in armour, let them depart home to their woonted trades and occupations:
in the meane time let vs drinke togither in signe of agreement, that the people on both sides
maie sée it, and know that it is true, that we be light at a point.” They had no sooner shaken
hands togither, but that a knight was sent streight waies from the archbishop, to bring word
to the people that there was peace concluded, commanding ech man to laie aside his armes, and
to resort home to their houses. The people beholding such tokens of peace, as shaking of hands,
and drinking togither of the lords in louing manner, they being alreadie wearied with the vnaccustomed
trauell of warre, brake vp their field and returned homewards: but in the meane time, whilest
the people of the archbishops side withdrew awaie, the number of the contrarie part increased,
according to order giuen by the earle of Westmerland; [Sidenote: The archbishop of Yorke and
the earle marshall arrested. Exton.] and yet the archbishop perceiued not that he was deceiued,
vntill the earle of Westmerland arrested both him and the earle marshall with diuerse other.
Thus saith Walsingham.

But others write somwhat otherwise of this matter, affirming that the earle of Westmerland
in deed, and the lord Rafe Eeuers, procured the archbishop & the earle marshall, to come to
a communication with them, vpon a ground iust in the midwaie betwixt both the armies, where
the earle of Westmerland in talke declared to them how perilous an enterprise they had taken
in hand, so to raise the people, and to mooue warre against the king, aduising them therefore
to submit themselues without further delaie vnto the kings mercie, and his sonne the lord Iohn,
who was present there in the field with banners spred, redie to trie the matter by dint of
sword if they refused this counsell: and therefore he willed them to remember themselues well:
& if they would not yeeld and craue the kings pardon, he had them doo their best to defend
themselues.

Herevpon as well the archbishop as the earle marshall submitted themselues vnto the king, and
to his sonne the lord Iohn that was there present, and returned not to their armie. Wherevpon
their troops scaled and fled their waies: but being pursued, manie were taken, manie slaine,
and manie spoiled of that that they had about them, & so permitted to go their waies. Howsoeuer
the matter was handled, true it is that the archbishop, and the earle marshall were brought
to Pomfret to the king, who in this meane while was aduanced thither with his power, [Sidenote:
The archbishop of Yorke, the earle marshall, & others put to death.] and from thence he went
to Yorke, whither the prisoners were also brought, and there beheaded the morrow after Whitsundaie
in a place without the citie, that is to vnderstand, the archbishop himselfe, the earle marshall,
sir Iohn Lampleie, and sir Robert Plumpton. [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Walsin. Hypod.
pag. 168.] ¶ Vnto all which persons though indemnitie were promised, yet was the same to none
of them at anie hand performed. By the issue hereof, I meane the death of the foresaid, but
speciallie of the archbishop, the prophesie of a sickelie canon of Bridlington in Yorkshire
fell out to be true, who darklie inough foretold this matter, [Sidenote *: Archiepiscopus.]
& the infortunate euent thereof in these words hereafter following, saieng:

  Pacem tractabunt, sed fraudem subter arabunt,
  Pro nulla marca, saluabitur ille* hierarcha.

[Sidenote: The archbishop reputed a martyr.] The archbishop suffered death verie constantlie,
insomuch as the common people tooke it he died a martyr, affirming that certeine miracles were
wrought as well in the field where he was executed, as also in the place where he was buried:
and immediatlie vpon such bruits, both men and women began to worship his dead carcasse, whom
they loued so much, when he was aliue, till they were forbidden by the kings fréends, and for
feare gaue ouer to visit the place of his sepulture. The earle marshalls bodie by the kings
leaue was buried in the cathedrall church, manie lamenting his destinie; but his head was set
on a pole aloft on the wals for a certeine space, till by the kings permission [after the same
had suffered manie a hot sunnie daie, and manie a wet shower of raine] it was taken downe and
buried togither with the bodie.

After the king, accordinglie as séemed to him good, had ransomed and punished by gréeuous fines
the citizens of Yorke (which had borne armour on their archbishops side against him) he departed
frō Yorke with an armie of thirtie and seuen thousand fighting men, [Sidenote: The lords executed.]
furnished with all prouision necessarie, marching northwards against the earle of Northumberland.
At his cōming to Durham, the lord Hastings, the lord Fauconbridge, sir Iohn Colleuill of the
Dale, and sir Iohn Griffith, being conuicted of the conspiracie, were there beheaded. The earle
of Northumberland, hearing that his counsell was bewraied, and his confederats brought to confusion,
through too much hast of the archbishop of Yorke, with thrée hundred horsse got him to Berwike.
The king comming forward quickelie, wan the castell of Warkewoorth. [Sidenote: The earle of
Northumberland.] Wherevpon the earle of Northumberland, not thinking himselfe in suertie at
Berwike, fled with the lord Berdolfe into Scotland, where they were receiued of Dauid lord Fleming.

The king comming to Berwike, commanded them that kept the castell against him to render it
into his hands, and when they flatlie denied so to doo, [Sidenote: Berwike castell yéelded
to the king.] he caused a péece of artillerie to be planted against one of the towers, and
at the first shot ouerthrowing part thereof, they within were put in such feare, that they
simplie yéelded themselues without any maner of condition, wholie to remaine at the kings pleasure.
[Sidenote: The sonne of the lord Greistoke and others put to death. Exton.] Herevpon the chiefest
of them, to wit, sir Willian Greistoke, sonne to Rafe baron of Greistoke, sir Henrie Beinton,
and Iohn Blenkinsop, with foure or fiue other were put to death, and diuerse other were kept
in prison. Some write that the earle of Northumberland at his entring into Scotland, deliuered
the towne of Berwike vnto the Scots, who hearing of king Henries approch, and despairing to
defend the towne against him, set fire on it and departed. There was not one house that was
left vnburnt, except the friers and the church.

After that the king had disposed things in such conuenient order as stood with his pleasure
at Berwike, [Sidenote: The castell of Alnewike yéelded to the king.] he came backe, and had
the castell of Alnewike deliuered vnto him, with all other the castels that belonged to the
erle of Northumberland in the north parts, as Prodhow, Langlie, [Sidenote: The K. passeth into
wales.] Cockermouth, Aluham, and Newstéed. Thus hauing quieted the north parts, he tooke his
iournie directlie into Wales, where he found fortune nothing fauourable vnto him, for all his
attempts had euill successe, [Sidenote: He looseth his cariages.] in somuch that losing fiftie
of his cariages through abundance of raine and waters, [Sidenote: He returneth.] he returned;
and comming to Worcester, he sent for the archbishop of Canturburie, and other bishops, declaring
to them the misfortune that had chanced to him, in consideration whereof he requested them
to helpe him with some portion of monie, towards the maintenance of his warres, for the taming
of the presumptuous and vnquiet Welshmen.

[Sidenote: Hall. The marshall Mōtmerācie sent to aid Owen Glendouer.] In the meane time, the
French king had appointed one of the marshals of France called Montmerancie, and the master
of his crosbowes, with twelue thousand men to saile into Wales to aid Owen Glendouer. They
tooke shipping at Brest, and hauing the wind prosperous, landed at Milford hauen, with an hundred
and fourtie ships, as Thomas Walsingham saith; though Enguerant de Monstrellet maketh mention
but of an hundred and twentie. The most part of their horsses were lost by the waie for lacke
of fresh water. The lord Berkleie, and Henrie Paie, espieng their aduantage, burnt fiftéene
of those French ships, as they laie at road there in the hauen of Milford: and shortlie after
the same lord Berkleie, and sir Thomas Swinborne, with the said Henrie Paie, tooke other fourtéene
ships, as they came that waie with prouision of vittels and munition foorth of France to the
aid of the other.

In the meane while the marshall Montmerancie, with his armie, [Sidenote: Carmarden woone by
the French.] besieged the towne of Carmarden, and wan it by composition, granting to the men
of warre that kept it against him, licence to depart whither they would, & to take with them
all their mooueable goods: the castell of Penbroke they assaulted not, estéeming it to be so
well manned, [Sidenote: Hereford west manfullie defended.] that they shuld but lose their labour
in attempting it. Notwithstanding they besieged the towne of Hereford west, which neuerthelesse
was so well defended by the earle of Arundell and his power, that they lost more than they
wan, [Sidenote: Enguerant de Monstrellet saith they burnt the townes but could not win the
castell.] and so they departed towards the towne of Denbigh, where they found Owen Glendouer
abiding for their comming, with ten thousand of his Welshmen. Here were the Frenchmen ioifullie
receiued of the Welsh rebels, [Sidenote: The suburbs of worcester burnt.] and so when all things
were prepared, they passed by Glamorganshire towards Worcester, and there burnt the suburbes:
but hearing of the kings approch, they suddenlie returned towards Wales.

The king with a great puissance followed, and found them imbattelled on a high mounteine, where
there was a great vallie betwixt both the armies, so that either armie might plainelie perceiue
the other, and either host looked to be assailed of his aduersarie, & therefore sought to take
the aduantage of ground. Thus they continued for the space of eight daies from morning till
night, readie to abide, but not to giue battell. There were manie skirmishes, [Sidenote: French
lords slaine.] and diuerse proper feats of armes wrought in that meane while, in the which
the French lost manie of their nobles and gentlemen, as the lord Patroullars de Tries, brother
to the marshall of France, the lord Matelonne or Martelonne, the lord de la Valle, and the
bastard of Bourbon, with other, to the number (as some haue written) of fiue hundred. But Enguerant
de Monstrellet affirmeth, that vpon their returne into France, there wanted not aboue thréescore
persons of all their companies.

After they had laine thus one against another the space of eight daies (as before is said)
vittels began to faile, so that they were inforced to dislodge. The French and Welshmen withdrew
into Wales, and though the Englishmen followed, yet impeached with the desart grounds and barren
countrie, thorough which they must passe, as our felles and craggie mounteins, from hill to
dale, from marish to wood, from naught to woorsse (as Hall saith) without vittels or succour,
the king was of force constrained to retire with his armie, and returne againe to Worcester,
in which returne the enimies tooke certeine cariages of his laden with vittels. [Sidenote:
The Frenchmen returne home. Anno Reg. 7.] The Frenchmen after the armies were thus withdrawne,
returned into Britaine, making small brags of their painefull iournie.

This yeare at London, the earle of Arundell maried the bastard daughter of the king of Portingale,
the king of England and the quéene with their presence honoring the solemnitie of that feast,
which was kept with all sumptuous roialtie, the morrow after saint Katharins daie. ¶ And on
the daie of the Conception of our ladie, the ladie Philip king Henries daughter was proclamed
quéene of Denmarke, Norwaie, and Sweden, in presence of such ambassadors, as the last summer
came hither from the king of those countries, to demand hir in marriage for him, [Sidenote:
Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Walsin. Roiston burned.] and had so trauelled in the matter, that finallie
they obteined it. ¶ On the daie of the translation of saint Martine, the towne of Roiston was
on fire. [Sidenote: 1406.] [Sidenote: A parlement.] This yeare the first of March a parlement
began, which continued almost all this yeare: for after that in the lower house they had denied
a long time to grant to any subsidie: yet at length, a little before Christmasse, [Sidenote:
A fiftéenth grāted by the temporaltie.] in the eight yeare of his reigne they granted a fifteenth
to the losse and great damage of the communaltie, for through lingering of time, the expenses
of knights and burgesses grew almost in value to the summe that was demanded.

[Sidenote: A new kind of subsidie granted by the cleargie.] Moreouer, by the clergie a new
kind of subsidie was granted, to the king, to be leuied of stipendarie priests and friers mendicants,
and other such religious men as soong for the dead, celebrating (as they termed it) anniuersaries:
euerie of them gaue halfe a marke, in reliefe of other of the cleargie that had still borne
the burthen for them before. Whervpon now they murmured and grudged sore, for that they were
thus charged at that present. The same time the earle of Northumberland, and the lord Bardolfe,
warned by the lord Dauid Fleming, that there was a conspiracie practised to deliuer them into
the king of Englands hands, [Sidenote: The lord Fleming lost his life for giuing knowledge
to the earle of Northumberland of that which was meant against him.] fled into Wales to Owen
Glendouer. This cost the lord Fleming his life: for after it was knowne that he had disclosed
to the earle of Northumberland what was meant against him, and that the earle therevpon was
shifted awaie, certeine of the Scots slue the said lord Fleming.

Wherevpon no small grudge rose betwixt those that so slue him, and the said lord Flemings friends.
For this and other matters, [Sidenote: Dissention amōg the Scotish nobilitie.] such dissention
sproong vp amongst the Scotish nobilitie, that one durst not trust another, so that they were
glad to sue for a truce betwixt England and them, which was granted to indure for one yeare,
as in some books we find recorded. This truce being obteined, Robert king of Scotland (vpon
considerations, [Sidenote: Eleuen years saith Harding.] as in the Scotish historie ye may read
more at large) sent his eldest son Iames intituled prince of Scotland (a child not past nine
yeares of age) to be conueied into France, [Sidenote: The prince of Scotland staid here in
England.] vnder the conduct of the earle of Orkenie, and a bishop, in hope that he might there
both remaine in safetie, and also learne the French toong.

But it fortuned, that as they sailed neare to the English coast about Flambrough head in Holdernesse,
their ship was taken and staied by certeine mariners of Claie (a towne in Norffolke) that were
abroad the same time; and so he and all his companie being apprehended the thirtith of March,
was conueied to Windsore, where though he had letters from his father, which he presented to
the king, conteining a request in his sonnes behalfe for fauour to be shewed towards him, if
by chance he landed within any of his dominions: yet was he deteined, and as well he himselfe
as the earle of Orkenie was committed to safe keeping in the Tower of London, but the bishop
got away and escaped (as some write) by what means I know not. By the Scotish writers we find
that this chanced in the yeare 1404, that is two yeares before the time noted in diuerse English
writers, as Thomas Walsingham and other. But Harding saith it was in the ninth yeare of king
Henries reigne, to wit, in the yeare 1408.

But whensoeuer it chanced, it is to be thought, that there was no truce at that present betweene
the two realmes, but that the warre was rather open, [Sidenote: Hall.] sith diuerse English
rebels still remained in Scotland, and were there succored to the high displeasure of king
Henrie. ¶ By authoritie of the parlement that all this time continued, [Sidenote: Robert Halome
archb. of Yorke.] the Britons that serued the quéene, with two of hir daughters were banished
the realme. Robert Halome chancellor of Oxford, as then being in the popes court at Rome, was
created archbishop of Yorke. ¶ Moreouer the same time, the pope gaue vnto Thomas Langlie the
bishoprike of Durham, which by the death of Walter Skirlow was then void. In the summer of
this yeare, the ladie Philip the kings yoonger daughter was sent ouer to hir affianced husband,
[Sidenote: The king and the quéene brought hir to Lin where she took shipping.] [Sidenote:
Tho. Walsi.] Erike king of Denmarke, Norwaie, and Sweden, being conueied thither with great
pompe, and there married to the said king, where she tasted (according to the common spéech
vsed in praieng for the successe of such as match togither in mariage) both ioy and some sorrow
among. There attended hir thither Henrie Bowet bishop of Bath, and the lord Richard brother
to the duke of Yorke.

There was a iusts held at London, betwixt the earle of Kent and the erle of Marre a Scotishman;
also sir Iohn Cornewall, and the lord Beaumont, [Sidenote: An. Reg. 8.] [Sidenote: The duke
of Yorke restored to libertie.] against other two Scotish knights, whereof the honor remained
with the Englishmen. In the parlement which yet continued, the duke of Yorke was restored to
his former libertie, estate and dignitie, [Sidenote: The earle of Kent in fauor with the king.]
where manie supposed that he had beene dead long before that time in prison. Edmund Holland
earle of Kent was in such fauour with king Henrie, that he not onelie aduanced him to high
offices and great honors, [Sidenote: He marrieth a daughter of Barnabo lord of Millane.] but
also to his great costs and charges obteined for him the ladie Lucie, eldest daughter, and
one of the heirs of the lord Barnabo of Millane, which Barnabo paied to him 100000 ducates,
in the church of S. Marie Oueries in Southwarke, by the hands of Don Alfonso de Cainuola, vpon
the day of the solemnization of the marriage, which was the foure and twentith of Ianuarie.

[Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Walsi. Hypod. pag. 161.] ¶ In this yeare Roger of Walden departed
this life; who hauing béene tossed vp and downe with sundrie changes of fortune, tried in a
short time how inconstant, vncerteine variable, wandering, vnstable, and flitting she is; which
when she is thought firmelie to stand, she slipperinglie falleth; and with a dissembling looke
counterfaiteth false ioies. [Sidenote: Roger of waldens variable fortune.] For by the meanes
of hir changeablenesse, the said Roger of a poore fellow, grew vp to be high lord treasuror
of the realme, and shortlie after archbishop of Canturburie; but by what right, the world knoweth;
considering that the lord Thomas Arundell was then liuing. Anon after he was deposed from his
dignitie, and lead the life of an ordinarie priuat man a long time; within a while after againe
he was promoted and made bishop of London, which sée he had not possessed a full yeare, but
was depriued, and Nicholas Hobwith succeeded in his roome. So that hereby men are taught not
to be proud of their preferment, nor to reckon of them as of perpetuities, sithens they may
be as soone dispossessed as possessed of them; and for that all estates & degrées depend vpon
Gods power and prouidence, whereof the poet diuinelie saieth, [Sidenote: Ouid. lib. de Pont. 4.]

  Ludit in humanis diuina potentia rebus,
    Et certam præsens vix habet hora fidem.

[Sidenote: An addition of Francis Thin.] In this yeare the seuenth of Maie was Thomas Langlie
consecrated bishop of Durham after the decease of Walter Skirlow. In which place he continued
one and thirtie yeares. He among other his beneficiall déeds beautified the church of Durham
for euer with a chanterie of two chapleines. Besides which for the increase of learning (wherwith
himselfe was greatlie furnished) he built two schooles, the one for grammar to instruct youth,
whereby in following time they might be made more able to benefit themselues and serue their
countrie: and the other of musicke, wherein children might be made apt to serue God and the
church, both which schooles he erected in a parcell of ground cōmonlie called The plaie gréene.
To which buildings (for he was one that delighted much therein, and like vnto the philosopher
Anaxagoras supposed that there was not any more earthlie felicitie, than to erect sumptuous
palaces, wherby after their death the memorie of the founders might haue continuance) he added
manie sumptuous parts of the palace of Durham. In the towne whereof he did also from the ground
(of most statelie stone) erect a new gaole with the gate-house to the same, in that place where
of old it remained, and then by iniurie of time fallen downe and consumed. This man inioied
the sée of Durham almost the whole time of thrée kings, that is; about six yeares and six moneths
in the time of Henrie the fourth, nine yeares and fiue moneths in the time of Henrie the fift,
and fifteene yeares in the time of Henrie the sixt; during the gouernment of all which princes,
he was all his life time highlie estéemed and reuerenced for his singular wisedome, and for
the great authoritie he bare in publike, betwéene whome and the maior of Newcastell arose great
contention, about a bridge called Tinebridge in the towne of Gateshed or Goteshed, in Latine
called Caput capræ. But in the yeare of our redemption 1416, and of Henrie the fift, the fourth,
and of his bishoprike, the eleuenth, this bishop had the recouerie thereof, as appeareth by
the letter of atturnie of the said bishop, made to diuerse to take possession of the same.

The letter of atturnie wherby the bishop authorised diuerse to take possession of Tinebridge.

According wherevnto in the said yeare, possession was deliuered in the presence of these persons,
whose names I thinke not vnmeet for their posterities cause to be remembred, being persons
of good credit and of antiquitie, that is to saie, Iohn Lomelie, Rafe Ewraie, Robert Hilton,
William Fulthrop, William Tempest, Thomas Suerties, Robert *Cogniers, [Sidenote *: Coniers.]
William Claxton shiriffe of Durham, Robert de ✝Egle, [Sidenote ✝: Ogle.] Iohn Bertram, Iohn
Widerington, and Iohn Middleton knights of Northumberland, Christopher Morslie, Will. Osmunderlaw
knights of Westmerland; and also in the presence of these esquiers, Robert Hilton, Robert Ewrie,
William Bowes, Iohn Coniers, William Lampton the elder, Iohn de Morden, William Lampton the
yoonger, Hugh Burunghell, Iohn Britlie, William Bellingham, Robert Belthis, Henrie Talboies;
Thomas Garbois, Iohn de Hutton, William Hutton, Thomas Cooke of Fisburn, and fiue others. This
bishop also procured certeine liberties from the pope in the church of Durham, by vertue of
which grant they which were excommunicate (and might not inioy the priuilege of any sacraments,
in other places throughout the bishoprike) should yet baptise their children in a font of that
church, in an especiall place appointed therefore, and also receiue the other sacraments there
to be administred vnto them. He died the eight and twentith of Nouember in the yeare of our
redemption 1437, and was buried in the church of Durham in the chanterie which he had before
erected. Before whose death at his manour of Holdon he builded all the west gates there of
goodlie stone and lime, with the chambers thereto belonging on which he placed his armes.

[Sidenote: 1407.] [Sidenote: The duke of Orleance besiegeth townes in Gascoigne.] The duke
of Orleance hauing leuied a mightie armie, had besieged the townes of Burge and Blaie in Gascoigne,
meaning with force to win the same; but so it fortuned, that for the space of eight wéekes
togither, there passed not one daie without tempest of raine, snow, and haile, mixed with winds
and lightnings, which killed as well men as cattell, by reason whereof he lost (as was reported)
six thousand men, so that he was constreined to breake vp his camps from before both those
townes, and to get him awaie with dishonor, for all his brags and boasts made at his first
comming thither. [Sidenote: Henrie Paie a valiant seaman.] The same time, Henrie Paie and certeine
other persons of the fiue ports, with fiftéene ships, tooke an hundred and twentie prises,
which laie at anchor in and about the coast of Britaine, laden with iron, salt, oile, & Rochell
wines.

In this season also billes were set vp in diuerse places of London, [Sidenote: K. Richard still
aliue as was feigned.] and on the doore of Paules church, in which was conteined that king
Richard being aliue and in health, would come shortlie with great magnificence & power to recouer
againe his kingdome: but the contriuer of this deuise was quicklie found out, apprehended,
and punished according to his demerits. ¶ The citie of London this yeare in the summer was
so infected with pestilent mortalitie, that the king durst not repaire thither, nor come neere
to it. Whervpon he being at the castell of Leeds in Kent, and departing from thence, tooke
ship at Quinburgh in the Ile of Shepie, to saile ouer vnto Lée in Essex, and so to go to Plaschie,
there to passe the time till the mortalitie was ceassed.

As he was vpon the sea, [Sidenote: The king in danger to be taken by French pirats.] certeine
French pirats which laie lurking at the Thames mouth to watch for some preie, got knowledge
by some meanes (as was supposed) of kings passage, and therevpon as he was in the middest of
his course, they entred among his fléet, and tooke foure vessels next to the kings ship, [Sidenote:
Sir Thomas Rampston taken.] and in one of the same vessels sir Thomas Rampston the kings vicechamberlaine,
with all his chamber stuffe and apparell. They followed the king so néere, that if his ship
had not béene swift, [Sidenote: The king escaped through swiftnesse of his ship.] he had landed
sooner in France than in Essex: but such was his good hap, that he escaped and arriued at his
appointed port. The lord Camois, [Sidenote: The lord Camois put in blame.] that was commanded
with certeine ships of warre to waft the king ouer (whether the wind turned so that he could
not kéepe his direct course, or that his ship was but a slug) ran so far in the kings displeasure,
that he was attached & indited, for that (as was surmized against him) he had practised with
the Frenchmen, that the king might by them haue béene taken in his passage.

Yee haue heard that the pope by vertue of his prouision had giuen the archbishoprike of Yorke
vnto maister Robert Halom; but the king was so offended therewith, that the said Robert might
in no wise inioy that benefice, [Sidenote: Henrie Bowet archbishop of Yorke.] and so at length,
to satisfie the kings pleasure, maister Henrie Bowet was translated from Bath vnto Yorke, and
maister Robert Halom was made bishop of Salisburie then void by remoouing of Henrie Chichellie
to S. Dauids. [Sidenote: Abirusewith.] The lord Henrie prince of Wales this yeare in the summer
season besieged the castell of Abirusewith, and constreined them within to compound with him
vnder certeine conditions for truce; [Sidenote: Owen Glendouer.] but the prince was no sooner
from thence departed, but that Owen Glendouer by subtill craft entered the castell, put out
the kéepers, and charging them with treason for concluding an agréement without his consent,
placed other in that fortresse to defend it to his vse.

About the feast of the Assumption of our ladie, [Sidenote: Sir Robert Knols departeth this
life. Bermondsey.] that ancient warriour and worthie knight sir Robert Knols departed this
life: he was (as before yée haue heard) borne of meane parentage, but growen into such estimation
for his valiant prowesse, as he was thought méet to haue the leading of whole armies, and the
rule and gouernment of large prouinces. For not long before his deceasse, he being gouernour
of Aquitaine, [Sidenote: S. Albons.] incumbred with age, resigned his office vnto sir Thomas
Belfort, a right valiant capteine, and therewith returned into England, where he died at a
manour place of his in Norffolke, & from thence brought to London in a litter, [Sidenote: He
was buried in the white friers.] with great pompe and much torch light, was buried in the church
of White friers in Fleetstreet by the ladie Constance his wife, where was doone for him a solemne
obsequie, with a great feast, and liberall dole to the poore.

Besides the diuerse noble exploits, and famous warlike enterprises atchiued by this valiant
sonne of Mars, [Sidenote: He built Rochester bridge commonlie called Knols bridge.] he (to
continue the perpetuall memorie of his name) builded the bridge of Rochester, ouer the riuer
of Medwaie with a chappell at the end thereof; he repared also the bodie of the church of the
White friers where he was buried, which church was first founded by the ancestour of the lord
Greie of Codner. [Sidenote: Thom. Wals.] He also founded a college of secular priests at Pomfret,
and did manie other things in his life right commendable. Sir Thomas Rampston constable of
the tower was drowned, in comming from the court as he would haue shut the bridge, [Sidenote:
An. Reg. 9.] the streame being so big, that it ouerturned his barge. This yeare the twentith
of October began a parlement holden at Glocester, [Sidenote: Thom Wals. A subsidie.] but remooued
to London as should appeare in Nouember; for (as we find) in that moneth this yéere 1407, and
ninth of this kings reign, a subsidie was granted by authoritie of a parlement then assembled
at London, to be leuied through the whole realme.

[Sidenote: The lord Camois arreigned & acquited.] The lord Camois was arreigned the last of
October, before Edmund earle of Kent that daie high steward of England, and by his péeres acquit
of the offense, whereof he had beene indicted (as before yee haue heard) and so dismissed at
the barre, was restored againe both to his goods, lands, and offices. ¶ This yeare the winter
was excéeding sharpe through frost and snow that continued & couered the ground by all the
moneths of December, Ianuarie, Februarie, and March, insomuch that thrushes, blackbirds, and
manie thousand birds of the like smaller size, perished with verie cold and hunger.

[Sidenote: 1408.] The earle of Northumberland, and the lord Bardolfe, after they had béene
in Wales in France and Flanders, to purchase aid against king Henrie, were returned backe into
Scotland, and had remained there now for the space of a whole yeare: and as their euill fortune
would, whilest the king held a councell of the nobilitie at London, [Sidenote: The earle of
Northumb. & the lord Bardolfe returne into Englād.] the said earle of Northumberland and lord
Bardolfe, in a dismall houre, with a great power of Scots returned into England, recouering
diuerse of the earls castels and seigniories, for the people in great numbers resorted vnto
them. Héerevpon incouraged with hope of good successe, they entred into Yorkeshire, & there
began to destroie the countrie. At their cōming to Threske, they published a proclamation,
signifieng that they were come in comfort of the English nation, as to reléeue the common-wealth,
willing all such as loued the libertie of their countrie, to repaire vnto them, with their
armor on their backes, and in defensible wise to assist them.

The king aduertised hereof, caused a great armie to be assembled, and came forward with the
same towards his enimies: but yer the king came to Notingham, [Sidenote: The shiriffe of Yorkeshire.]
sir Thomas, or (as other copies haue) Rafe Rokesbie shiriffe of Yorkeshire, assembled the forces
of the countrie to resist the earle and his power, comming to Grimbaut brigs, beside Knaresborough,
there to stop them the passage; but they returning aside, got to Weatherbie, and so to Tadcaster,
and finallie came forward vnto Bramham more, [Sidenote: His hardie corage to fight.] neere
to Haizelwood, where they chose their ground méet to fight vpon. The shiriffe was as readie
to giue battell as the earle to receiue it, and so with a standard of S. George spred, set
fiercelie vpon the earle, who vnder a standard of his owne armes incountered his aduersaries
with great manhood. There was a sore incounter and cruell conflict betwixt the parties but
in the end the victorie fell to the shiriffe. [Sidenote: The earle of Northumberland slaine.]
The lord Bardolfe was taken, but sore wounded, so that he shortlie after died of the hurts.
¶ As for the earle of Northumberland, he was slaine outright: so that now the prophesie was
fulfilled, which gaue an inkling of this his heauie hap long before; namelie, [Sidenote: Abr.
Fl. out of Tho. Walsin. Hypod. pag. 172]

  Stirps Persitina periet confusa ruina.

For this earle was the stocke and maine root of all that were left aliue called by the name
of Persie; and of manie more by diuerse slaughters dispatched. For whose misfortune the people
were not a little sorrie, making report of the gentlemans valiantnesse, renowne, and honour,
and applieng vnto him certeine lamentable verses out of Lucane, saieng;

  Sed nos nec sanguis, nec tantùm vulnera nostri
  Affecere senis; quantum gestata per vrbem
  Ora ducis, quæ transfixo deformia pilo
  Vidimus.

For his head, full of siluer horie heares, being put vpon a stake, was openlie carried through
London and set vpon the bridge of the same citie: in like maner was the lord Bardolfes. The
bishop of Bangor was taken and pardoned by the king, for that when he was apprehended, he had
no armor on his backe. This battell was fought the ninteenth day of Februarie. ¶ The king to
purge the North parts of all rebellion, and to take order for the punishment of those that
were accused to haue succoured and assisted the earle of Northumberland, went to Yorke, where
when manie were condemned, and diuerse put to great fines, and the countrie brought to quietnesse,
[Sidenote: The abbat of Hails hanged.] he caused the abbat of Hailes to be hanged, who had
béene in armour against him with the foresaid earle.

[Sidenote: The earle of Kent sent to the sea.] In the beginning of March, the king sent Edmund
Holland earle of Kent with an armie of men imbarked in certeine ships of warre vnto the sea,
bicause he had knowledge that diuerse rouers were wafting about the coasts of this land, and
did much hurt. When the earle had serched the coasts, and could meet with no enimie abrode,
he was aduertised by espials, that the pirats hearing of his comming to sea were withdrawne
into Britaine: wherefore the said earle intending to be reuenged on them, whome he sought,
directed his course thither, and finding that they had laid vp their ships in the hauens, so
as he could not fight with them by sea, he lanched out his boates, [Sidenote: Briake in Britaine
assaulted by the Englishmen.] and with his fierce souldiers tooke land, and manfullie assaulted
the towne of Briake standing by the sea side. They within stoutlie defended themselues, dooing
their best to repell the Englishmen, with throwing darts, [Sidenote: The earle of Kent woūded
to death.] casting stones, and shooting quarels; in which conflict the earle receiued a wound
in his head, so that he died thereof within fiue daies after.

[Sidenote: Briake taken by force.] The Englishmen not dismaied with his death, but the more
desirous to obteine their purpose, continued their assaults, till by fine force they entered
the towne, set it on fire, and slue all that made resistance; and after for want of a generall
to command what should be doone, they being pestered with preies and prisoners, returned into
England. ¶ The countesse of Kent that was daughter (as yée haue heard) to Bernabo viscont lord
of Millaine, hauing no issue by hir husband, was now mooued by the king after hir husbands
death, to marrie with his bastard brother the earle of Dorset, a man verie aged and euill visaged;
[Sidenote: The countes of Kent maketh hir owne choise of hir second husband.] wherevpon she
misliking him, meant rather to satisfie hir owne fancie, and therefore chose for hir husband
Henrie Mortimer, a goodlie yoong bacheller, by whome she had issue a daughter named Anne, married
to sir Iohn Awbemond.

This yeare, the next daie after the feast daie of Marie Magdalen, [Sidenote: A disputation
betwixt diuines of Oxford & Cambridge for their obediēce to the pope.] in a councell holden
at London by the cleargie, the doctors of the vniuersities of Cambridge and Oxenford being
there, with the rest assembled, debated the matter, whether they ought to withdraw from the
pope, paiments of monie, and their accustomed obedience, considering that contrarie to his
word and promise so solemnlie made, and with an oth confirmed, he withdrewe himselfe from the
place where he (according to couenants) should haue béene present, to aduance an agréement
and concord in the church. ¶ Vpon the euen of the Natiuitie of our ladie, there chanced such
flouds through abundance of raine, [Sidenote: An. Reg. 10.] [Sidenote: The cardinal of Burges
cōmeth into England in disfauor of pope Gregorie.] as the like had not béene séene afore by
anie man then liuing. Also about the feast of All saints, the cardinal of Burges came into
England, to informe the king and the cleargie of the inconstant dealing of pope Gregorie, in
like maner as he had informed the French king and the Frenchmen, to the end that he might persuade
both these kings which were accounted the chéefe in christendome, to put vnto their helping
hands, that the same pope Gregorie might be induced to obserue and performe that oth, which
he had receiued, so as by the roiall authoritie of those two kings, concord might be had in
the church. The French king (as this cardinall alleged) following the aduise of the learned
men of the vniuersities of Paris, Bologna, Orleans, Tholouse, and Montpellier, [Sidenote: The
resolutiō of the French king concerning the two popes.] to auoid the danger of fauouring schisme,
determined to obeie neither the one nor the other that contended for the papasie, vntill peace
and concord might be restored in Christes church. The king vnderstanding the purpose of the
cardinall, shewed him what courtesie might be deuised, offering to beare his charges, so long
as it pleased him to remaine in England, and promising him to consider aduisedlie of the matter.

[Sidenote: 1409.] [Sidenote: A cōuocation at S. Paules in London.] This yeare after the Epiphanie
the archbishop of Canturburie called the cleargie of the prouince of Canturburie to a conuocation
in Paules church at London, [Sidenote: Ambassaders appointed to go to the councell at Pisa.]
to choose sufficient persons that might go vnto the generall councell, appointed to be kept
at Pisa: herevpon were chosen Robert Halom bishop of Salisburie, Henrie Chichleie bishop of
saint Dauid, & Thomas Chillingden prior of Christes church in Canturburie. The king before
this had sent ambassadors vnto pope Gregorie, [Sidenote: The contents of the kings letters
to the pope.] and also to the cardinals; to wit, sir Iohn Coluill knight, and maister Nicholas
Rixton clearke, with letters, signifieng the gréefe he had conceiued for the inconuenience
that fell in the christian common-wealth thorough the schisme; and withall putting the pope
in remembrance what mischéefe and destruction of people had chanced by the same schisme. These
and the like matters, to vtter what desire he had to haue a vnitie in the church, he declared
frankelie in his letters directed to the pope, so as it might appear to the world, how soberlie
and modestlie he sought to induce the pope to procure peace & concord in the church.

An extract of the kings letter to pope Gregorie.

MOST holie father, if the seat apostolicall would vouchsafe by prouidence to consider, how
great dangers haue inuaded the whole world vnder the pretext of schisme, and speciallie the
slaughter of christian people, which is of aboue two hundred thousand (as it is auouched) by
the outrage of warres and battell sproong vp in sundrie parts of the world; & now latelie to
the number of thirtie thousand (by meanes of the dissention about the bishoprike of Leods betweene
two, one contending vnder the authoritie of true pope, and the other vnder the title of antipape)
slaine in a foughten field, whereof we make report with greefe; trulie the said seat would
be pensiue in spirit, and with due sorow troubled in mind; yea at the motion of a good conscience,
it would rather giue ouer the honour of that apostolicall seat, than suffer such detestable
deeds further to be committed, vnder the cloke of dissimulation, taking example of the true
and naturall mother, which pleading before king Salomon, chose rather to part with hir owne
child, than to see him cut in sunder. And although by that new creation of nine cardinals,
against your oth (that we maie vse the words of others) made by you, wherof a vehement cause
of woondering is risen, it maie in some sort be supposed (as it is likelie) that your intent
respecteth not anie end of schisme; yet farre be it alwaies from the world, that your circumspect
seat should be charged by anie person with so great inconstancie of mind, whereby the last
errour might be counted woorsse than the first, &c.

An extract of the said kings letter to the cardinals.

We being desirous to shew how great zeale we had, & haue, that peace might be granted & given
to the church by the consent of the states of our realme, haue sent ouer our letters to our
lord the pope, according to the tenure of a copie inclosed within these presents effectuallie
to be executed. Wherefore we doo earnestlie beseech the reuerend college of you; that if happilie
the said Gregorie be present at the generall councell holden at Pisa, about the yeelding vp
of the papasie, according to the promise and oth by him manie a time made, to fulfill your
and our desires, as we wish and beare our selues in hand he will doo; that you will so order
things concerning his estate, that thereby God maie cheeflie be pleased, and as well Gregorie
himselfe, as we, who deseruedlie doo tender his honour and commoditie with all our harts, maie
be beholden to giue you and euerie of you manifold thanks.

[Sidenote: Wicklifs doctrine mainteined by the learned.] This yeare certeine learned men in
Oxford and other places, publikelie in their sermons mainteined and set foorth the opinions
and conclusions of Wickliffe. This troubled the bishops and other of the clergie sore, insomuch
that in their conuocation house, the six and twentith of Iune, by a speciall mandat of the
lord chancellor in presence of the procurators, regents, and others, as Richard Courtneie,
Richard Talbot, [Sidenote: Sentēce pronounced against Wicklifs books.] Nicholas Zouch, Walter
Midford, & such like in great multitude: sentence was pronounced by Iohn Wels, doctor of the
canon law against the books of Iohn Wickliffe doctor of diuinitie, intituled De sermone in
monte, Triologorum de simonia, De perfectione statuum, De ordine Christiano, De gradibus cleri
ecclesiæ: and to these was added the third treatise, which he compiled of logike or sophistrie.
These books and the conclusions in the same conteined, the chancellor of the vniuersitie of
Oxford by common consent and assent of the regents and non regents of the same vniuersitie,
reproued, disanulled and condemned, inhibiting on paine of the great cursse and depriuation
of all degrées scholasticall, that none from thencefoorth should affirme, teach, or preach
by anie manner of meanes or waies, the same hereticall books (as they tearmed them) conteining
anie the like opinions as he taught and set foorth in the same books.

[Sidenote: Fabian. Iusts in Smithfield.] This yeare about Midsummer, were roiall iusts holden
at London in Smithfield betwixt the seneschall of Heinault, and certeine Henewers challengers,
[Sidenote: Owen Glendouer endeth his life in great miserie.] and the earle of Summerset, and
certeine Englishmen defendants. The Welsh rebell Owen Glendouer made an end of his wretched
life in this tenth yeare of king Henrie his reigne, being driuen now in his latter time (as
we find recorded) to such miserie, that in manner despairing of all comfort, he fled into desert
places and solitarie caves, where being destitute of all releefe and succour, dreading to shew
his face to anie creature, and finallie lacking meat to susteine nature, [Sidenote: An. Reg.
11.] [Sidenote: Officers made.] for méere hunger and lacke of food, miserablie pined awaie
and died. [Sidenote: 1410] [Sidenote: A parlement.] This yeare Thomas Beaufort earle of Surrie
was made chancellor, and Henrie Scroope lord treasuror. A parlement began this yeare in the
quindene of saint Hilarie, in which the commons of the lower house exhibited a bill to the
king and lords of the vpper house, conteining effect as followeth.

A supplication to the king.

[Sidenote: Tho. Walsi. Fabian.] To the most excellent lord our k. and to all the nobles in
this present parlement assembled, your faithfull commons doo humblie signifie, that our souereigne
lord the king might haue of the temporall possessions, lands & reuenues which are lewdlie spent,
consumed and wasted by the bishops, abbats, and priors, within this realme, so much in value
as would suffice to find and susteine one hundred and fiftie earles, one thousand & fiue hundred
knights, six thousand and two hundred esquiers, and one hundred hospitals more than now be.

[Sidenote: Thom. Wals.] The king (as some write) vpon aduised consideration hereof had, misliked
of the motion, & therevpon commanded that from thencefoorth they should not presume to studie
about anie such matters. An other thing the commons sued to haue granted vnto them, but could
not obteine: which was, that clearks conuicted should not from thence foorth be deliuered to
the bishops prison. Moreouer they demanded to haue the statute either reuoked or qualified,
which had béene established by authoritie of parlement, in the second yeare of this kings reigne,
against such as were reputed to be heretiks, or Lollards. By force whereof it was prouided,
that wheresoeuer such manner of persons should be found and knowne to preach or teach their
erronious doctrine, [Sidenote: King Henrie a fauorer of the clergie.] they should be attached
with the kings writ, and brought to the next goale: but the king séemed so highlie to fauour
the cleargie, that the commons were answered plainelie, they should not come by their purpose,
but rather that the said statute should be made more rigorous and sharpe for the punishment
of such persons.

[Sidenote: Iohn Badbie burnt.] [Sidenote: Tho. Walsi.] During this parlement one Iohn Badbie
a tailor, or (as some write) a smith, being conuict of heresie, was brought into Smithfield,
and there in a tun or pipe burnt to death, in pitifull manner. [Sidenote: The prince being
present at the execution offereth him pardon.] The kings eldest sonne the lord Henrie prince
of Wales being present, offered him his pardon, first before the fire was kindled, if he would
haue recanted his opinions; and after when the fire was kindled, hearing him make a roring
noise verie pitifullie, the prince caused the fire to be plucked backe, and exhorting him being
with pitifull paine almost dead, to remember himselfe, and renounce his opinions, promising
him not onelie life, but also thrée pence a daie so long as he liued to be paid out of the
kings coffers: [Sidenote: Notable constancie of Badbie.] but he hauing recouered his spirits
againe, refused the princes offer, choosing eftsoones to tast the fire, and so to die, than
to forsake his opinions. Wherevpon the prince commanded, that he should be put into the tun
againe, from thencefoorth not to haue anie fauour or pardon at all, and so it was doone, and
the fire put to him againe, and he consumed to ashes.

[Sidenote: The kings demand in parlement.] The king demanded in this parlement, that it might
be granted to him, to haue euerie yeare in which he held no parlement a tenth of the cleargie,
[Sidenote: A long parlement.] and a fifteenth of the laitie; but the estates would not agrée
therevnto, by reason whereof, [Sidenote: A fiftéenth granted.] the parlement continued till
almost the middle of Maie. At length they granted to giue him a fiftéenth, [Sidenote: Earle
of Surrie deceasseth.] not without murmuring and grudging of the commonaltie. About this season
died the lord Thomas Beauford earle of Surrie. The eleuenth of April or therabouts, the towne
of saint Omers was burnt by casuall fire togither with the abbeie, [Sidenote: Preparation made
to win Calis. Thom. Walsi.] in which towne was such strange and maruellous prouision of engines,
and all manner of furniture and preparation for the winning of Calis, as the like had neuer
béene séene nor heard of. Some write, that they of Calis standing in doubt of such purueiance,
& great preparation deuised to annoie them, procured a yoong man to kindle a fire, whereby
all that dreadfull prouision was consumed to ashes, and so they within Calis deliuered of a
great great deale of care and feare which they had thereof.

¶ But Tho. Walsingham maketh a full & complet declaration, both concerning the dukes deuise,
& also of the Calesians deliuerance from the danger of the same; which because it perfecteth
the report of this present matter, [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Thom. Wals. Hypod. pag. 175.]
I haue thought good to set downe word for word as I find it in his Hypodigme. About the ninth
of April (saith he) the towne of saint Andomaire was burned with the abbeie, wherein was hidden
and laid vp the execrable prouision of the duke of Burgognie, who had vowed either to destroie
the towne of Calis, [Sidenote: The engines of the duke of Burgognie against Calis that shot
out barrels of poison.] or else to subdue it to the will and pleasure of the French. There
a great manie engines to this daie no where seene, there an excéeding sort of vessels conteining
poison in them were kept in store, which he had aforehand prouided to cast out to the destruction
of the said towne. For he had gathered togither serpents, scorpions, todes, and other kinds
of venemous things, which he had closed and shut vp in little barrels, that when the flesh
or substance of those noisome creatures was rotten, and dissolued into filthie matter, he might
laie siege to Calis, and cast the said barrels let out of engines into the towne; which with
the violence of the throw being dasht in péeces, might choke them that were within, poison
the harnessed men touched therewith, & with their scattered venem infect all the stréets, lanes,
& passages of the towne. In the meane time, a certeine yoong man allured with couetousnesse
of gold, or lead with affection and loue towards the kings towne, asked of the gouernours what
reward he should deserue, that would discharge and set frée the towne from so great a feare,
and would burne all the prouision which they suspected. Herevpon they leuied a summe of that
yellow metall (namelie gold) wherewith the yoong man contented, went his waie, and with fire
readie made for the purpose, did not onelie burne the said venemous matter and infected stuffe,
but also togither with the monasterie almost the whole towne.

[Sidenote: Sir Robert Umfreuill viceadmerall.] [Sidenote: Harding.] [Sidenote: His exploit
in Scotland.] Moreouer this yeare sir Robert Umfreuill vice-admeral of England, annoied the
countries on the sea coasts of Scotland: for comming into the Forth with ten ships of warre,
and lieng there fourtéene daies togither, he landed euerie daie on the one side of the riuer
or the other, taking preies, spoiles & prisoners; notwithstanding the duke of Albanie, and
the earle Dowglas were readie there, with a great power to resist him: he burnt the galliot
of Scotland (being a ship of great account) with manie other vessels lieng the same time at
the Blackenesh ouer against Lieth. At his returne from thence, he brought with him fourtéene
good ships, and manie other great prises of cloathes, both woollen, and linnen, pitch, tarre,
woad, flower, meale, wheat and rie, [Sidenote: His surname Robert Mendmarket.] which being
sold abroad, the markets were well holpen thereby, so that his surname of Robert Mendmarket
séemed verie well to agrée with his qualities, which name he got by this occasion.

About foure years before this, he burnt the towne of Peples on the market daie, causing his
men to meat the cloathes which they got there with their bowes, [Sidenote: By what occasion
he came by that surname.] & so to sell them awaie, wherevpon the Scots named him Robert Mendmarket.
Shortlie after his returne from the sea now in this eleuenth yeare of king Henries reigne,
he made a road into Scotland by land, [Sidenote: The earle of Angus Umfreuill cōmonlie called
erle of Kime.] hauing with him his nephue yoong Gilbert Umfreuill earle of Angus (commonlie
called earle of Kime) being then but fourtéene yeares of age, and this was the first time that
the said earle spread his banner. They burnt at that time Iedwoorth, and the most part of Tiuidale.
[Sidenote: 1411.] [Sidenote: An. Reg. 12.] [Sidenote: A great death by the flix.] This yeare
there died of the bloudie flix in the citie of Burdeaux fourtéene thousand persons, and so
sore raged that disease in Gascoigne and Guien, that there wanted people to dresse their vines,
and presse their grapes. [Sidenote: John Prendergest and William Long.] Iohn Prendergest knight,
& William Long scowred the seas, as no pirat durst appeare, but that merchants & passengers
might passe to & fro in safetie. But yet through disdaine of some that enuied their good successe,
the same Prendergest and Long were accused of robberies which they should practise, in spoling
such ships as they met with, of diuerse things against the owners wils. Prendergest was driuen
to take sanctuarie at Westminster, and could not be suffered to lodge in anie mans house for
feare of the kings displeasure, commanding, that none should receiue him, and so was constreined
to set vp a tent within the porch of saint Peters church there, and to haue his seruants to
watch nightlie about him for doubt to be murthered of his aduersaries: but his associat William
Long laie still at the sea, till the lord admerall hauing prepared certeine vessels went to
the sea himselfe in person to fetch him: but yet he could not catch him vntill he had promised
him pardon, [Sidenote: Long committed to the Tower.] and vndertaken vpon his fidelitie that
he should haue no harme: but notwithstanding all promises, [Sidenote: The archbishop of Canturburie
not suffred to visit the vniuersitie of Oxenford.] vpon his comming in he was shut vp fast
in the Tower, and so for a time remained in durance. The archbishop of Canturburie minding
in this season to visit the vniuersitie of Oxenford, could not be suffered, in consideration
of priuileges which they pretended to haue.

[Sidenote: 1412.] The realme of France in this meane while was disquieted, [Sidenote: France
disquieted with two factions.] with the two factions of Burgognie and Orleance, in most miserable
wise, as in the French histories it maie further appeare. Neither could the king, being a lunatike
person, and féeble of braine, take any full order for reforming of such mischéefs, so that
the whole state of the kingdome was maruellouslie brought in decaie: [Sidenote: The duke of
Orleance murthered.] neither tooke those troubles end by the death of the duke of Orleance
(murthered at length through the practise of the duke of Burgognie) but rather more perilouslie
increased.

They tooke shipping at Douer, & landed at Sluis, from whence with speedie iournies in the latter
end of this twelfth yeare of king Henries reigne they came to Arras, where they found the duke
of Burgognie, of whom they were ioifullie receiued, & from thence he appointed them to go vnto
Peron, where he assembled a power also of his owne subiects, and remoouing from thence, he
marched through the countrie, by Roie, Bretueill, Beauois, and Gisors, till he came with his
armie vnto Pontois, where he remained about the space of thrée wéeks. [Sidenote: An. Reg. 13.]
From Pontois the two and twentith of October, the duke of Burgognie marched towards Paris,
and passing the riuer of Saine at Pont Meulene, he staid not till he came to Paris, into the
which he entred the 23 of October, late in the euening. The duke of Orleance laie at the same
time at saint Denis, with the more part of his armie, & the residue kept the towne of S. Clou,
where a bridge laie ouer the riuer of Saine. On the 9 of Nouember, [Sidenote: Saint Clou taken
by the helpe of the Englishmen.] with hard & sharpe fight the Englishmen gat the towne of saint
Clou, with the bridge, slue & drowned nine hundred souldiors that were set there to defend
that passage, besides 400 that were taken prisoners. They tooke also aboue 12 hundred horsses,
which they found in the towne, with great riches, whereof the men of warre made their profit.

[Sidenote: Sir Manserd de Bos put to death.] Among other prisoners, sir Manserd de Bos a valiant
capteine was taken, and shortlie after put to death, as diuerse other were which the Burgognians
bought of the Englishmen that had taken them prisoners. The tower that stood at the end of
the bridge could not be woon. [Sidenote: Harding.] At an other bickering also, it chanced that
the Englishmen, vnder the leading of the earle of Angus or Kime, had the vpper hand, and tooke
manie prisoners, whom the duke of Burgognie would that they should haue béene likewise put
to death as traitors to their countrie, but the said earle of Angus answered for himselfe,
and the residue of the Englishmen, that they would rather die all in the place, than suffer
their prisoners to be vsed otherwise than as men of war ought to be, that is, to haue their
liues saued, and to be ransomed according as the law of armes required, and by that meanes
they were preserued. The duke of Burgognie hauing the world at will (for the duke of Orleance
immediatlie after the losse of saint Clou, departing from saint Denis, got him into the high
countries) sent home the Englishmen with hartie thanks, and great rewards.

[Sidenote: Recor. Turris. Creations of noblemen.] This yeare, the king created his brother
Thomas Beauford earle of Dorset; [Sidenote: Hall.] and his sonne the lord Thomas of Lancaster,
that was lord steward of England, and earle of Aubemarle, he created duke of Clarence. Iohn
duke of Burgognie, [Sidenote: The Orleantiall factiō sueth to the K. of England for aid.] hauing
now the gouernance both of the French king and his relme, so persecuted the duke of Orleance
and his complices, that finallie they for their last refuge required aid of king Henrie, sending
ouer vnto him certeine persons as their lawfull procurators (of the which one was called Albert
Aubemont, a man of great wit, learning, & audacitie) to offer in name of the confederates vnto
the said king Henrie and to his sonnes, certeine conditions, [Sidenote: The confederates of
the Orleantiall faction.] which were made and concluded the yeare of our lord 1412, the eight
of Maie. The names of the chiefe confederats were these, Iohn duke of Berrie and earle of Poictou,
Charles duke of Orleance, and Valois erle of Blois, and Beaumont lord of Coucie and Ach, Iohn
duke of Bourbon, and Auuergne earle of Clearmont forest, and Lisle lord of Beaulieu, and Casteau
Chinon, Iohn duke of Alanson, Barnard earle of Arminacke, and others. The effect of the articles
which these confederats were agréed vpon touching their offer to the king of England, were
as followeth.

The articles of couenants which they offered to the king of England.

1 First, they offered their bodies, finances, and lands, to serue the king of England, his
heires, and successors, in all iust causes and actions, sauing alwaies their allegiance, knowing
that he would not further inquire of them.

2 Secondlie, they offered their sonnes and daughters, néeces and nephues, and all other their
kinsfolks to be bestowed in marriages accordingly to the pleasure of the king of England.

3 Thirdlie, they offered their castels, townes, treasures, & all their other goods, to serue
the forsaid king.

4 Fourthlie, they offered their fréends, alies, and well-willers to serue him, being the most
part of all the nobles of France, churchmen, clearkes, and honest citizens, as it should well
appeare.

5 Fiftlie, they offered to put him in possession of the duchie of Guien, which they were readie
to protest to belong vnto the king of England, in like and semblable wise, in libertie and
franchises, as any other king of England his predecessor had held and inioied the same.

6 Sixtlie, that they would be readie to recognise the lands which they possessed within that
duchie, to hold the same of the king of England, as of the verie true duke of Guien, promising
all seruices and homages after the best maner that might be.

7 Seuenthlie, they promised to deliuer vnto the king, as much as laie in them, all townes and
castels appertaining to the roialtie and seigniorie of the king of England, which are in number
twentie townes and castels: and as to the regard of other townes & fortresses which were not
in their hands, they would to the vttermost of their powers, helpe the king of England and
his heires to win them out of his aduersaries hands.

8 Eightlie, that the duke of Berrie, as vassall to the king of England; and likewise the duke
of Orleance his subiect and vassall, should hold of him by homage and fealtie, the lands and
seigniories hereafter following, that is to saie; the duke of Berrie to hold onelie the countie
of Ponthieu during his life, and the duke of Orleance to hold the countie of Angulesme during
his life, and the countie of Perigourt for euer, and the earle of Arminacke to hold foure castels
vpon certeine suerties and conditions, as by indenture should be appointed. For the which offers,
couenants and agreements, they requested of the king of England to condescend vnto these conditions
insuing.

The conditions which they requested of the king of England.

1 First, that the king of England, as duke of Guien should defend and succor them as he ought
to doo, against all men, as their verie lord and souereigne, and speciallie vntill they had
executed iustice fullie vpon the duke of Burgognie, for the crime which he committed vpon the
person of the duke of Orleance.

2 Secondlie, that he should assist them against the said duke of Burgognie and his fautors;
to recouer againe their goods, which by occasion of the said duke and his fréends they had
lost and béene depriued of.

3 Thirdlie, that he should likewise aid them in all iust quarels, for recouering of damages
doone to their fréends, vassals and subiects.

4 Fourthlie, to helpe and assist them for the concluding and establishing of a firme peace
betwixt both the realmes, so far as was possible. ¶ And further they besought the king of England
to send vnto them eight thousand men, to aid them against the duke of Burgognie and his complices,
which dailie procured the French king to make war vpon them séeking by all waies & meanes how
to destroie them.

The king of England louinglie interteined the messengers, and vpon consideration had of their
offers, as well for that he detested the shamefull murther of the duke of Orleance (which remained
vnpunished by support of such as mainteined the duke of Burgognie, who (as it appeared) would
keepe promise no longer than serued his owne turne) as also for that the same offers seemed
to make greatlie both for his honor and profit, thought that by the office of a king he was
bound in dutie to succour them that cried for iustice, and could not haue it; and namelie sith
in right they were his subiects and vassals, [Sidenote: The king of England taketh vpō him
to defend the Orleantiall faction.] he ought to defend them in maintenance of his superioritie
and seigniorie. Herevpon as duke of Guien, he tooke vpon him to succor and defend them against
all men, as their verie lord and souereigne, and so sending awaie the messengers, promised
to send them aid verie shortlie.

This feat was not so secretlie wrought, but that it was knowne streightwaies in France. [Sidenote:
The earle of saint Paule assaulteth the castell of Guisnes.] Wherefore the French kings councell
sent the earle of saint Paule downe into Picardie, with fiftéene hundred horssemen, and a great
number of footmen, who approching to Guisnes, attempted to assault the castell, but was repelled
and beaten backe, [Sidenote: His fortune against Englishmen.] so that he retired to the towne
of saint Quintines, as one that neuer wan gaine at the Englishmens hands, but euer departed
from them with losse and dishonor. In this meane season the French king being led by the duke
of Burgognie, pursued them that tooke part with the duke of Orleance, commonlie called Arminacks,
and after the winning of diuerse townes he besieged the citie of Burges in Berrie, comming
before it vpon saturdaie the eleuenth of Iune, with a right huge armie. Within this citie were
the dukes of Berrie and Burbon, the earle of Auxerre, the lord Dalbret, the archbishops of
Sens and Burges, the bishops of Paris and Chartres, hauing with them fifteene hundred armed
men, and foure hundred archers and arcubalisters.

There were with the king at this siege, his sonne the duke of Aquitane, otherwise called the
Dolphin, the dukes of Burgognie and Bar, and a great number of other earles, lords, knights,
and gentlemen; so that the citie was besieged euen till within the Faux burges of that side
towards Dun le Roie. The siege continued, till at length through mediation of Philibert de
Lignac, lord great maister of the Rhodes, and the marshall of Sauoie, that were both in the
kings campe, trauelling betwixt the parties, there were appointed commissioners on both sides
to treat for peace, to wit the master of the crosbowes, and the seneshall of Heinalt, and certeine
other for the king; and the archbishop of Burges, [Sidenote: A peace concluded betwixt the
two factions of Burgognie & Orleance.] with the lord of Gaucourt & others for the Orlientiall
side. These cōming togither on a fridaie, the fifteenth of Iulie in the Dolphins tent, vsed
the matter with such discretion, that they concluded a peace, & so on the wednesdaie next following,
the campe brake vp, & the king returned.

[Sidenote: The prince of Wales accused to his father.] Whilest these things were a dooing in
France, the lord Henrie prince of Wales, [Sidenote: Iohn Stow.] eldest sonne to king Henrie,
got knowledge that certeine of his fathers seruants were busie to giue informations against
him whereby discord might arise betwixt him and his father: for they put into the kings head,
not onelie what euill rule (according to the course of youth) the prince kept to the offense
of manie: but also what great resort of people came to his house, [Sidenote: The suspicious
gelousie of the king toward his son.] so that the court was nothing furnished with such a traine
as dailie followed the prince. These tales brought no small suspicion into the kings head,
least his sonne would presume to vsurpe the crowne, he being yet aliue, through which suspicious
gelousie, it was perceiued that he fauoured not his sonne, as in times past he had doone.

The Prince sore offended with such persons, as by slanderous reports, sought not onelie to
spot his good name abrode in the realme, but to sowe discord also betwixt him and his father,
wrote his letters into euerie part of the realme, to reprooue all such slanderous deuises of
those that sought his discredit. And to cleare himselfe the better, that the world might vnderstand
what wrong he had to be slandered in such wise: [Sidenote: The prince goeth to the court with
a great traine.] about the feast of Peter and Paule, to wit, the nine and twentith daie of
Iune, he came to the court with such a number of noble men and other his freends that wished
him well, [Sidenote: His strange apparell.] as the like traine had béene sildome seene repairing
to the court at any one time in those daies. He was apparelled in a gowne of blew satten, full
of small oilet holes, at euerie hole the néedle hanging by a silke thred with which it was
sewed. About his arme he ware an hounds collar set full of S S of gold, and the tirets likewise
being of the same metall.

The court was then at Westminster, where he being entred into the hall, not one of his companie
durst once aduance himselfe further than the fire in the same hall, notwithstanding they were
earnestlie requested by the lords to come higher: but they regarding what they had in commandement
of the prince, would not presume to doo in any thing contrarie there vnto. He himself onelie
accompanied with those of the kings house, was streight admitted to the presence of the king
his father, who being at that time gréeuouslie diseased, [Sidenote: The prince cōmeth to the
kings presēce.] yet caused himselfe in his chaire to be borne into his priuie chamber, where
in the presence of thrée or foure persons, in whome he had most confidence, he commanded the
prince to shew what he had to saie concerning the cause of his comming.

[Sidenote: His words to his father.] The prince knéeling downe before his father said: “Most
redoubted and souereigne lord and father, I am at this time come to your presence as your liege
man, and as your naturall sonne, in all things to be at your commandement. And where I vnderstand
you haue in suspicion my demeanour against your grace, you know verie well, that if I knew
any man within this realme, of whome you should stand in feare, my duetie were to punish that
person, thereby to remooue that greefe from your heart. Then how much more ought I to suffer
death, to ease your grace of that gréefe which you haue of me, being your naturall sonne and
liege man: and to that end I haue this daie made my selfe readie by confession and receiuing
of the sacrament. And therefore I beseech you most redoubted lord and deare father, for the
honour of God, to ease your heart of all such suspicion as you haue of me, and to dispatch
me héere before your knees, with this same dagger” [and withall he deliuered vnto the king
his dagger, in all humble reuerence; adding further, that his life was not so deare to him,
that he wished to liue one daie with his displeasure] “and therefore in thus ridding me out
of life, and your selfe from all suspicion, here in presence of these lords, and before God
at the daie of the generall iudgement, I faithfullie protest clearlie to forgiue you.”

[Sidenote: The kings wordes to the prince his son.] The king mooued herewith, cast from him
the dagger, and imbracing the prince kissed him, and with shedding teares confessed, that in
déed he had him partlie in suspicion, though now (as he perceiued) not with iust cause, and
therefore from thencefoorth no misreport should cause him to haue him in mistrust, and this
he promised of his honour. So by his great wisedome was the wrongfull suspicion which his father
had conceiued against him remooued, and he restored to his fauour. [Sidenote: Exton.] And further,
where he could not but gréeuouslie complaine of them that had slandered him so greatlie, to
the defacing not onelie of his honor, [Sidenote: The princes request to haue his accusors to
answer their wrōgful slanders.] but also putting him in danger of his life, he humblie besought
the king that they might answer their vniust accusation; and in case they were found to haue
forged such matters vpon a malicious purpose, that then they might suffer some punishment for
their faults, though not to the full of that they had deserued. The king séeming to grant his
resonable desire, yet told him that he must tarrie a parlement, that such offenders might be
punished by iudgement of their péeres: and so for that time he was dismissed, with great loue
and signes of fatherlie affection.

[Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of Angl. præliis.] ¶ Thus were the father and the sonne reconciled,
betwixt whom the said pick-thanks had sowne diuision, insomuch that the sonne vpon a vehement
conceit of vnkindnesse sproong in the father, was in the waie to be worne out of fauour. Which
was the more likelie to come to passe, by their informations that priuilie charged him with
riot and other vnciuill demeanor vnséemelie for a prince. Indeed he was youthfullie giuen,
growne to audacitie, and had chosen him companions agréeable to his age; with whome he spent
the time in such recreations, exercises, and delights as he fansied. But yet (it should séeme
by the report of some writers) that his behauiour was not offensiue or at least tending to
the damage of anie bodie; sith he had a care to auoid dooing of wrong, and to tender his affections
within the tract of vertue, whereby he opened vnto himselfe a redie passage of good liking
among the prudent sort, and was beloued of such as could discerne his disposition, which was
in no degree so excessiue, as that he deserued in such vehement maner to be suspected. In whose
dispraise I find little, but to his praise verie much, parcell whereof I will deliuer by the
waie as a metyard whereby the residue may be measured. The late poet that versified the warres
of the valorous Englishmen, speaking of the issue of Henrie the fourth saith of this prince
(among other things) as followeth: [Sidenote: In Angl. præliis, sub. Hen. 4.]

  --------procero qui natu maximus hæres
  Corpore, progressus cùm pubertatis ad annos
  Esset, res gessit multas iuueniliter audax,
  Asciscens comites quo spar sibi iunxerat ætas,
  Nil tamen iniustè commisit, nil tamen vnquam
  Extra virtutis normam, sapientibus æquè
  Ac aliis charus.

[Sidenote: Sir Iohn Prendergest restored to the kings fauour is sent to sea.] About the same
time, Iohn Prendergest knight, being restored to the kings fauour, with thirtie ships scowred
the seas, tooke good prises of wine and vitels, which reléeued the commons greatlie. Amongst
other enterprises, he landed vpon the sudden at Craal on the faire day, tooke the towne, and
robbed the faire, so as they that were come thither to sell their wares, had quicke vtterance
and slow paiment. King Henrie vnderstanding that the French king by setting on of the duke
of Burgognie in pursuing contrarie faction, [Sidenote: The duke of Clarence sent to aid the
duke of Orleance.] had besieged the citie of Burges (as before yée haue heard) determined with
all spéed to aid the duke of Orleance, & so about the feast of the Assumption of our ladie,
he sent ouer an armie of eight hundred men of armes, and nine thousand archers, vnder the leading
of his second sonne the duke of Clarence accompanied with Edward duke of Yorke, Thomas earle
of Dorset and diuerse other noble men and worthie capteins. They landed in the Baie de la Hogue
saint Wast, in the countrie of Constantine. The Englishmen swarmed like bées round about the
countrie, robbing and spoiling the same.

[Sidenote: Enguerant.] Shortlie after their departure from the place where they landed, there
came to them six hundred armed men of Gascoignes that were inrolled at Burdeaux. When newes
thereof came to the French court, being then at Auxerre, [Sidenote: The earle of Alanson and
Richmond sent to the duke of Clarence.] incontinentlie the earles of Alanson and Richmond were
dispatched to go vnto the English campe, bicause they had euer béene partakers with the duke
of Orleance, to giue them thanks for their paines, and to aduertise them of the peace that
had beene latelie concluded betwixt the parties, and therefore to take order with them, that
they might be satisfied, so as they should not spoile & waste the countrie, [Sidenote: The
duke of Clarence marcheth toward Guien.] as they had begun. But whereas the Englishmen were
gréedie to haue, and the duke of Orleance was not rich to paie, they marched on towards Guien
in good order, and what by sacking of townes, and ransoming of rich prisoners, they got great
treasure, and manie good preies and booties.

[Sidenote: Enguerant.] Being passed the riuer of Loire they spoiled the towne of Beaulieu,
[Sidenote: The lord of Rambures.] and with fire and sword wasted the countries of Touraine
and Maine. [Sidenote: The earles of Kent & Warwike sent ouer to Calis.] The lord de Rambures
appointed to resist such violence, was easilie vanquished. Moreouer, to the aid of the duke
of Orleance, the king of England sent ouer to Calis the earls of Kent and Warwike, with two
thousand fighting men, which spoiled and wasted the countrie of Bullennois, burnt the towne
of Samer de Bois, and tooke with assault the fortresse of Russalt, [Sidenote: Fabian. Coine
changed.] and diuerse other. This yeare, the king abased the coines of his gold and siluer,
causing the same to be currant in this realme, at such value as the other was valued before,
where indéed the noble was woorsse by foure pence than the former, [Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out
of Fabian, pag. 388. Thrée floods without ebbing betwéen.] and so likewise of the siluer, the
coines whereof he appointed to be currant after the same rate. ¶ In this yeare, and vpon the
twelfth day of October, were thrée flouds in the Thames, the one following vpon the other,
& no ebbing betweene: which thing no man then liuing could remember the like to be seene.

[Sidenote: Abr. Fl. out of R. Grafton, pag. 433, 434, in folio.] ¶ In this kings time, and
in the eighth yeare of his reigne (as Richard Grafton hath recorded) a worthie citizen of London
named Richard Whitington, mercer and alderman, was elected maior of the said citie, and bare
that office three times. This man so bestowed his goods and substance, that he hath well deserued
to be registred in chronicles. First he erected one house or church in London to be a house
of praier, [Sidenote: Whitington college erected.] and named the same after his owne name,
Whitington college, remaining at this daie. In the said church, besides certeine preests and
clearks, he placed a number of poore aged men and women, [Sidenote: Charitie.] builded for
them houses and lodgings, and allowed them wood coles, cloth, and wéekelie [Sidenote: Newgate
builded.] monie to their great reléefe and comfort. This man also at his owne cost builded
the gate of London called Newgate in the yéere of our Lord 1422, which before was a most ouglie
and lothsome prison. [Sidenote: S. Bartholomews hospital.] He also builded more than the halfe
of S. Bartholomews hospitall in west Smithfield. He builded likewise the beautifull librarie
in the graie friers in London now called Christs hospitall, standing in the north part of the
cloister thereof, where in the wall his armes be grauen in stone. He also builded for the ease
of the maior of London, his brethren, and the worshipfull citizens, on the solemne daies of
their assemblie, [Sidenote: Guildhall chapell.] a chapell adioining to the Guildhall; to the
intent that before they entered into anie of their worldlie affaires, they should begin with
praier and inuocation to God for his assistance: at the end ioining to the south part of the
said chapell, he builded for the citie a librarie of stone, for the custodie of their records
and other bookes. [Sidenote: Guildhall inlarged.] He also builded a great part of the east
end of Guildhall; and did manie other good déeds worthie of imitation. By a writing of this
mans owne hand, which he willed to be fixed as a schedule to his last will and testament, it
appeareth what a pitifull and relenting heart he had at other mens miseries, and did not onelie
wish but also did what he could procure for their releefe. In so much that he charged and commanded
his executors, as they would answer before God at the daie of the resurrection of all flesh,
that if they found anie debtor of his, whome if in conscience they thought not to be well worth
three times as much as they owght him, and also out of other mens debt, and well able to paie,
that then they should neuer demand it; for he clearelie forgaue it: and that they should put
no man in sute for anie debt due to him: A worthie memoriall of a notable minded gentleman.

[Sidenote: An. Reg. 14.] Yée haue heard how the duke of Clarence and his armie did much hurt
in the realme of France, [Sidenote: The Duke of Orleance cōmeth to the English armie.] in places
as he passed: wherevpon at length, the duke of Orleance being earnestlie called vpon to dispatch
the Englishmen out of France, according to an article comprised in the conclusion of the peace,
he came to the duke of Clarence, rendering to him and his armie a thousand gramersies, and
disbursed to them as much monie as he or his fréends might easilie spare; and for the rest
being two hundred and nine thousand frankes remaining vnpaid, he deliuered in gage his second
brother, Iohn duke of Angolesme, which was grandfather to king Francis the first, that reigned
in our daies, sir Marcell de Burges, and sir Iohn de Samoures, sir Archembald Viliers, and
diuerse other, which earle continued long in England, as after shall appeare. When this agreement
was thus made betwixt the dukes of Orleance and Clarence, the English armie with rich preies,
booties and prisoners came to Burdéaux, [Sidenote: The lord of Helie marshall of France.] making
warre on the frontiers of France, to their great game. In this meane while, the lord of Helie,
one of the marshals of France, [Sidenote: Sir Iohn Blunt.] with an armie of foure thousand
men, besieged a certeine fortresse in Guien, which an English knight, one sir Iohn Blunt kept,
who with thrée hundred men that came to his aid, discomfited, chased, and ouerthrew the French
power, tooke prisoners twelue men of name, and other gentlemen to the number of six score,
and amongst other, the said marshall, who was sent ouer into England, and put in the castell
of Wissebet, from whence he escaped, and got ouer into France, where seruing the duke of Orleance
at the battell of Agincort he was slaine among other. For it gréeued him to consider the great
malice of christian princes, that were bent vpon a mischéefous purpose to destroie one another,
to the perill of their owne soules, rather than to make war against the enimies of the christian
faith, [Sidenote: The king is vexed with sicknesse.] as in conscience (it séemed to him) they
were bound. He held his Christmas this yeare at Eltham, being sore vexed with sicknesse, so
that it was thought sometime, that he had beene dead; notwithstanding it pleased God that he
somwhat recouered his strength againe, and so passed that Christmasse with as much ioy as he might.

[Sidenote: 1413.] The morrow after Candlemas daie began a parlement, which he had called at
London, [Sidenote: A parlement.] but he departed this life before the same parlement was ended:
for now that his prouisions were readie, and that he was furnished with sufficient treasure,
soldiers, capteins, vittels, munitions, tall ships, strong gallies, and all things necessarie
for such a roiall iournie as he pretended to take into the holie land, he was eftsoons taken
with a sore sicknesse, [Sidenote: The k. sick of an apoplexie. Hall.] which was not a leprosie,
striken by the hand of God (saith maister Hall) as foolish friers imagined; but a verie apoplexie,
of the which he languished till his appointed houre, and had none other gréefe nor maladie;
so that what man ordeineth, God altereth at his good will and pleasure, not giuing place more
to the prince, than to the poorest creature liuing, when he séeth his time to dispose of him
this waie or that, as to his omnipotent power and diuine prouidence seemeth expedient. [Sidenote:
Hall.] During this his last sicknesse, he caused his crowne (as some write) to be set on a
pillow at his beds head, and suddenlie his pangs so sore troubled him, that he laie as though
all his vitall spirits had beene from him departed. Such as were about him, thinking verelie
that he had béene departed, couered his face with a linnen cloth.

[Sidenote: The prince taketh awaie the crowne before his father was dead.] The prince his sonne
being hereof aduertised, entered into the chamber, tooke the crowne, and departed. The father
being suddenlie reuiued out of that trance, quicklie perceiued the lacke of his crowne; and
hauing knowledge that the prince his sonne had taken it awaie, [Sidenote: He is blamed of the
king.] caused him to come before his presence, requiring of him what he meant so to misuse
himselfe. [Sidenote: His answer.] The prince with a good audacitie answered; [Sidenote: A guiltie
conscience in extremitie of sicknesse pincheth sore.] “Sir, to mine and all mens iudgements
you seemed dead in this world, wherefore I as your next heire apparant tooke that as mine owne,
and not as yours.” Well faire sonne (said the king with a great sigh) what right I had to it,
God knoweth. Well (said the prince) if you die king, I will haue the garland, and trust to
kéepe it with the sword against all mine enimies as you haue doone. [Sidenote: The death of
Henrie the fourth.] Then said the king, “I commit all to God, and remember you to doo well.”
With that he turned himselfe in his bed, and shortlie after departed to God in a chamber of
the abbats of Westminster called Ierusalem, the twentith daie of March, in the yeare 1413,
and in the yeare of his age 46, when he had reigned thirteene yeares, fiue moneths and od daies,
in great perplexitie and little pleasure [or fourtéene yeares, as some haue noted, who name
not the disease whereof he died, but refer it to sicknesse absolutelie, whereby his time of
departure did approach and fetch him out of the world: as Ch. Okl. saith, whose words may serue
as a funerall epigramme in memoriall of the said king Henrie:

  Henricus quartus his septem rexerat annos
  Ànglorum gentem summa cum laude & amore,
  Iàmq; senescenti fatalis terminus æui
  Ingruerat, morbus fatalem accerserat horam.]

[Sidenote: Ab. Fl. out of Angl. præl. sub. Hen. 4] [Sidenote: Fabian.] We find, that he was
taken with his last sickenesse, while he was making his praiers at saint Edwards shrine, there
as it were to take his leaue, and so to procéed foorth on his iournie: he was so suddenlie
and greeuouslie taken, that such as were about him, feared least he would haue died presentlie,
wherfore to reléeue him (if it were possible) they bare him into a chamber that was next at
hand, belonging to the abbat of Westminster, where they laid him on a pallet before the fire,
and vsed all remedies to reuiue him. At length, he recouered his spéech, and vnderstanding
and perceiuing himselfe in a strange place which he knew not, he willed to know if the chamber
had anie particular name, wherevnto answer was made, that it was called Ierusalem. Then said
the king; “Lauds be giuen to the father of heauen, for now I know that I shall die heere in
this chamber, according to the prophesie of me declared, that I should depart this life in
Ierusalem.”

Whether this was true that so he spake, as one that gaue too much credit to foolish prophesies
& vaine tales, or whether it was fained, as in such cases it commonlie happeneth, we leaue
it to the aduised reader to iudge. [Sidenote: He is buried at Canturburie.] His bodie with
all funerall pompe was conueied vnto Canturburie, [Sidenote: His issue.] and there solemnlie
buried, leauing behind him by the ladie Marie daughter to the lord Humfrie Bohun earle of Hereford
and Northampton, Henrie prince of Wales, Thomas duke of Clarence, Iohn duke of Bedford, Humfrie
duke of Glocester, Blanch duchesse of Bauier, and Philip quéene of Denmarke: by his last wife
Iane, he had no children. [Sidenote: His stature.] This king was of a meane stature, well proportioned,
and formallie compact, quicke and liuelie, and of a stout courage. In his latter daies he shewed
himselfe so gentle, that he gat more loue amongst the nobles and people of this realme, than
he had purchased malice and euill will in the beginning.

But yet to speake a truth, by his proceedings, after he had atteined to the crowne, what with
such taxes, tallages, subsidies, and exactions as he was constreined to charge the people with;
and what by punishing such as mooued with disdeine to see him vsurpe the crowne (contrarie
to the oth taken at his entring into this land, vpon his returne from exile) did at sundrie
times rebell against him, he wan himselfe more hatred, than in all his life time (if it had
beene longer by manie yeares than it was) had beene possible for him to haue weeded out & remooued.
And yet doubtlesse, woorthie were his subiects to tast of that bitter cup, sithens they were
so readie to ioine and clappe hands with him, for the deposing of their rightfull and naturall
prince king Richard, whose chéefe fault rested onlie in that, that he was too bountifull to
his fréends, and too mercifull to his foes; speciallie if he had not béene drawne by others,
to séeke reuenge of those that abused his good and courteous nature. ¶ But now to returne to
the matter present. The duke of Clarence immediatlie vpon knowlege had of his father king Henrie
the fourth his death, returned out of Guien into England, with the earle of Angolesme, and
other prisoners.

Now will we rehearse what writers of our English nation liued in the daies of this king. That
renowmed poet Geffrie Chaucer is woorthilie named as principall, a man so exquisitlie learned
in all sciences, that his match was not lightlie found any where in those daies; and for reducing
our English toong to a perfect conformitie, [Sidenote: Iohn Stow.] he hath excelled therein
all other; he departed this life about the yeare of our Lord 1402, as Bale gathereth: but by
other it appeareth, that he deceassed the fiue and twentith of October in the yeare 1400, and
lieth buried at Westminster, in the south part of the great church there, as by a monument
erected by Nicholas Brigham it doth appeare. Iohn Gower descended of that worthie familie of
the Gowers of Stitenham in Yorkeshire (as Leland noteth) studied not onelie the common lawes
of this realme, but also other kinds of literature, and great knowledge in the same, namelie
in poeticall inuentions, applieng his indeuor with Chaucer, to garnish the English toong, in
bringing it from a rude vnperfectnesse, vnto a more apt elegancie: for whereas before those
daies, the learned vsed to write onelie in Latine or French, and not in English, our toong
remained verie barren, rude, and vnperfect; but now by the diligent industrie of Chaucer and
Gower, it was within a while greatlie amended, so as it grew not onelie verie rich and plentifull
in words, but also so proper and apt to expresse that which the mind conceiued, as anie other
vsuall language. Gower departed this life shortlie after the deceasse of his déere and louing
freend Chaucer; to wit, in the yeare 1402, being then come to great age, and blind for a certeine
time before his death. He was buried in the church of saint Marie Oueries in Southwarke.

was aduanced to the gouernement of the see of Couentrie and Lichfield, and at length was remooued
from thence, and made archbishop of Yorke, he wrote an inuectiue against king Henrie, and at
length lost his head, as before ye haue heard; Iohn Wrotham, a Carmelite frier of London, and
after made warden of an house of his order in Calis.

Furthermore, Iohn Colbie, a Carmelite frier of Norwich; William Thorpe a northerne man borne,
and student in Oxenford, an excellent diuine, [Sidenote: Acts and moments of Iohn Fox.] and
an earnest follower of that famous clearke Iohn Wickliffe, a notable preacher of the word,

Saltwood castell, where at length he died; Stephen Patrington, borne in Yorkeshire, a frier
Carmelite, prouinciall of his order through England, of which brood there were at that season

he ended his life in the yeare of our Lord 1418, which was about the sixt yeare of the reigne
of king Henrie the fift; Iohn Purueie, an excellent diuine, procéeded master of art in Oxenford,
[Sidenote: Sée maister Fox, in his booke of Acts, and monuments.] he was apprehended for such
doctrine as he taught, contrarie to the ordinances of the church of Rome, and was at length
compelled by Thomas Arundell, archbishop of Canturburie, to recant at Paules crosse seuen speciall
articles, he wrote diuerse treatises, & was the second time committed to prison in king Henrie
the fift his daies, by Henrie Chichleie, that succeeded Arundell in gouernement of the church

of diuinitie professed at Oxenford; Thomas Rudburne, archdeacon of Sudburie, and bishop of
saint Dauids in Wales, succéeding after Stephan Patrington, he wrote a chronicle, and certeine

Finallie and to conclude, Nicholas Riston, who being sore greeued in mind, as diuerse other
in those daies, to consider what inconuenience redounded to the church, by reason of the strife
