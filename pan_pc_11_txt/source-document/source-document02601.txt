There the mountains, but in general not the lowlands, are occupied by this species. A certain
minimum of moisture may be of direct importance to the mouse and certainly is indirectly important,
because certain hydrophytic or mesophytic grasses used by the mouse for food, for protection
from enemies, and for shelter from the elements are dependent on the moisture. Areas suitable
for Microtus montanus are separated by deserts that are dominated by sagebrush and other xerophytic
plants or by forests or rocky exposures at higher altitudes. A relatively small percentage,
probably less than ten per cent, of the total area even in the more favorable parts of the
range of the species is suitable for occupancy. In these mice, as in other microtines (Elton,
1942; Piper, 1909), there are seasonal, and irregularly multiannual fluctuations in population
density, which sometimes are extreme. Consequently the mice at some times seem to be absent
from suitable habitats, and at some other times occur there in amazingly large numbers.

Because the species is broken up into partly isolated, or at times completely isolated, colonies
or local populations it may be supposed that various evolutionary forces such as selection
and random genetic drift operate to foster variation. The degree to which racial distinction
is attained may depend upon these forces and the time available. In Microtus montanus in the
eastern Rocky Mountains the degree of subspecific distinction is not great.

The study here reported upon is based on 1,187 specimens of Microtus montanus from Wyoming,
Colorado, Idaho and Montana, and on work in the field. I spent approximately four months in
the field in this area, in the summers of 1950, 1951, and 1952. The specimens studied were
arranged according to localities and the larger series were compared statistically. Each of
two series, totaling 136 specimens, was studied intensively to ascertain the kind and range
of variation within single populations. Twenty-seven measurements, various proportions based
on these measurements, and differences in color were analyzed. Fifteen characters, judged to
be most significant, were selected for use in comparing all series. In addition, certain characters
that can not be expressed easily by measurements, such as inflation of the auditory bullae
and the curvature of the zygomatic arch, were observed. The studies by A. B. Howell (1924)
of variation in Microtus montanus yosemite Grinnell in California and those by O. B. Goin (1943)
of Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus (Ord) were useful. The external measurements are
from the collectors' field labels. The measurements of the skull all were taken with dial calipers
reading to a tenth of a millimeter. The anteroposterior measurements of the skull all were
taken along the shortest line between the points specified below and are not necessarily along
a line parallel to the long axis of the skull. These measurements were taken on the left side
of the skull whenever possible. Some of the skulls are damaged and therefore some measurements
could not be taken and are omitted in the computations. Measurements are in millimeters.

The results of these studies were submitted to the Department of Zoology and the Graduate School
of the University of Kansas in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master
of Arts (1952) and are available in manuscript form at the Museum of Natural History and the
library of the University of Kansas.

EXPLANATION OF MEASUREMENTS

     Caudal index.--the length of the tail expressed as a percentage of
     the length of the head and body. The length of the head and body is
     the collector's measurement of total length less the length of the
     tail.

CRANIAL MEASUREMENTS OF LENGTH.

     Condylobasilar length.--from the exoccipital condyle to the most
     posterior point on the border of the alveolus of the upper incisor.

     Alveolobasilar length.--from the posterior border of the alveolus
     of the third upper molar to the posterior border of the alveolus of
     the incisor.

     Palatilar length.--from the anteriormost part of the posterior
     border of the bony shelf of the palate to the posteriormost part of
     the alveolus of the incisor.

     Alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row.--from the most posterior
     point of the alveolus of the third upper molar to the most anterior
     point of the alveolus of the first upper molar.

MEASUREMENTS OF BREADTH.

     Zygomatic breadth.--greatest transverse width.

     Interorbital breadth.--the breadth of the interorbital
     constriction.

     Lambdoidal breadth.--between the lateralmost points of the
     lambdoidal crest.

     Prelambdoidal breadth.--between the medialmost margins of the
     prominent fenestrae in the posterodorsal parts of the squamosal
     bones. To these fenestrae Howell (1924:995) applied the adjective
     "prelambdoidal," but other authors have used other names (see Hill,
     1935:127).

     Depth of braincase.--shortest distance from the ventral side of the
     cranium at the suture between the basioccipital and basisphenoid
     bones to the dorsal surface of the cranium (usually not
     perpendicular to the long axis of the skull).

The history of our knowledge of Microtus montanus in this area begins with the early work of
the United States Bureau of Biological Survey directed by C. H. Merriam (1891), and participated
in by Vernon Bailey (1900, 1917), Merritt Cary (1911, 1917), and others. The changes in nomenclature
which grew out of increased understanding of these mice through additional collecting are expressed
in the synonymies under the accounts of subspecies. As a result of my studies two of the three
subspecific names previously proposed for mice from this area have been retained although changes
are proposed in the ranges assigned to the two subspecies and two additional heretofore unrecognized
subspecies are named and described. Furthermore the additional specimens and my studies of
variation make modifications in the characterization of these subspecies necessary. Not all
of the samples here assigned to a single subspecies are identical and I therefore list and
discuss some of the local variants.

     Numerous members of summer field parties from the Museum of Natural
     History at the University of Kansas collected most of the specimens
     studied and wrote field notes that have been helpful. I am grateful
     to these persons and to Professor E. R. Hall and Dr. R. H. Baker
     for their assistance and helpful suggestions. Specimens in the
     following museums were made available by their respective curators:
     Chicago Natural History Museum by Mr. Colin C. Sandborn, The Museum
     of Zoology at the University of Michigan by Dr. E. T. Hooper, The
     American Museum of Natural History by Mr. G. G. Goodwin, The United
     States National Museum by Dr. David H. Johnson and the Biological
     Surveys Collection by Miss Viola S. Schantz. A fellowship from the
     National Science Foundation made possible the studies at the
     museums other than at the University of Kansas.

     1917 (part).

     Type.--Adult male No. 23853/31253, U. S. National Museum,
     Department of Agriculture collection, from Pahsimeroi Mountains,
     Custer County, Idaho; obtained by C. Hart Merriam and Vernon
     Bailey, September 16, 1890.

     Range.--Idaho; southwestern Montana; most of the southwestern
     half of Wyoming; southward to central Colorado. See figure 1.

     Comparisons.--Comparisons with subspecies named as new in this
     paper will be found in the accounts of those subspecies beyond.
     From Microtus montanus fusus Hall, the subspecies to the south,
     M. m. nanus from Idaho differs as follows: averages smaller;
     slightly darker and less reddish and less yellowish in color;
     slightly wider braincase (see measurement of prelambdoidal
     breadth); larger bullae.

     Measurements.--Average (= arithmetical mean) measurements of 34
     specimens, both male and female, from several localities in eastern
     Idaho are: total length, 151; length of tail, 39; hind foot, 19.2;
     condylobasilar length of the skull, 25.0; zygomatic breadth, 15.0;
     alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.4; prelambdoidal
     breadth, 8.9; and lambdoidal breadth, 11.7.

     Average and extreme measurements of six adult males from near
     Pocatello, Bannock County, Idaho, and nine adult males from near
     Afton, Lincoln County, Wyoming, are, respectively, as follows:
     total length, 143(135-150), 163(143-179); length of tail,
     35.1(33-38), 42.8(36-49); caudal index, 32.0(28.0-33.1),
     35.7(30.6-41.9); hind foot, 18.9(18-20), 18.8(17-20);
     condylobasilar length of skull, 24.4(24.0-26.0), 25.6(24.5-26.2);
     alveolobasilar length, 14.1(13.7-14.5), 14.6(13.8-15.0); palatilar
     length, 13.2(12.9-13.6), 13.8(13.2-14.5); alveolar length of upper
     molar tooth-row, 6.3(6.1-6.5), 6.3(6.0-6.6); depth of braincase,
     7.7(7.5-7.9), 8.0(7.7-8.3); lambdoidal breadth, 11.4(11.0-11.7),
     12.0(11.3-12.7); prelambdoidal breadth, 9.1(8.6-9.4), 8.7(8.0-9.4);
     zygomatic breadth, 14.3(13.8-14.7), 15.3(14.4-16.3); interorbital
     breadth, 3.6(3.5-3.7), 3.5(3.3-3.7). The average length of the
     nasal bones in the series from Pocatello is 7.1 mm. The averages,
     which have not been included in Table 1, for three measurements of
     the series from Carbon County, Wyoming, are as follows (Encampment,
     males; Encampment, females; Savery, males; and Savery, females,
     respectively): alveolobasilar length, 14.4, 14.3, 14.5, 14.3;
     interorbital breadth, 3.5, 3.4, 3.5, 3.4; depth of braincase, 7.8,
     7.6, 7.9, 7.6. Additional measurements are included in Table 1 for
     other series.

Discussion.--The name Microtus montanus caryi Bailey is here placed in synonymy under M. m.
nanus (Merriam). Vernon Bailey (1917) in his description of caryi made four assumptions that
have been found to be entirely or partly invalid. First, he assumed that this is an "extreme
variant which gradually changes in characters across Nevada and Utah, and reaches its maximum
variation in Wyoming." The differences pointed out in subsequent descriptions of subspecies
found in the above area do not show a gradual change in any character, or in the number of
characters, nor is caryi an extreme when compared with the other subspecies. Second, Microtus
nanus was not, as Bailey assumed, a different species than Microtus montanus. Third, he assumed
that the characteristics of adults of nanus were adequately ascertainable from the thirteen
topotypes available to him. Subsequent sampling from Idaho shows that the series of specimens
available to Bailey was made up mostly of young and subadult animals. Finally, caryi does not
occupy as Bailey stated "the meadows along streams in the arid sagebrush country of the Bear
River, Green River, and Wind River valleys" exclusively, or characteristically. When the localities
from which the species actually is known are plotted, it seems that the arid basin serves as
a barrier and that the species is more commonly and abundantly found in montane meadows in
the Transition and Canadian life-zones.

Certain samples, here assigned to M. m. nanus, that vary from the average of the subspecies
deserve comment. For example, mice from the area in Wyoming southwest of the Green River (in
the Uinta Mountains) have relatively smaller feet, but are larger in both total length and
size of skull. Specimens from near Afton, Lincoln County, Wyoming, are relatively large in
both total length and size of skull. This series and specimens from Teton County, Wyoming,
are intermediate between nanus from Idaho and the newly named subspecies from near Cody, Park
County, Wyoming, described below, in terms of both darkness and the amount of reddish color.
Mice from Laramie County are more richly reddish-brown. The specimens from near Savery, in
Carbon County, Wyoming, are darker. The alveolobasilar length relative to the condylobasilar
length is smaller in the series from along Deer Creek, 16 mi. S, 11 mi. W Waltman, Natrona
County, Wyoming. The series from the southern tier of counties in Wyoming and some of the specimens
from Colorado have relatively wider zygomatic arches. The specimens from southern Sweetwater
County, Wyoming, are relatively paler, have a relatively longer tail and longer hindfeet, lesser
condylobasilar length, and wider braincase. Most of these variations are of questionable significance;
they may be chance variations owing to errors in sampling.

Much of the south-central part of the state is relatively low and relatively arid. This area
includes the arid basin of the Green River and its major tributaries and the arid Red Desert
along the continental divide in Sweetwater County. This area might have acted as a barrier
to the mice; gene flow might have been prevented between the populations of the western part
of the state and those farther east in the Medicine Bow Mountains and Laramie Mountains. Nevertheless
geographic variations of subspecific worth have not taken place. The barrier has either not
been of as long duration, or has not been so complete and effective, as the other barriers
in the state, namely the Absaroka Range, the Big Horn Basin, the Shoshone Basin, and the valley
of the North Platte River. These four barriers presumably have led to the differentiation of
the two subspecies that are newly named beyond. Each of the two areas which is set apart by
these barriers and in which one of the newly named subspecies has evolved is small; therefore
there is a lesser amount of suitable habitat available for each of the newly named mice than
there is for M. m. nanus. It is conceivable, therefore, that in periods of adverse conditions
in each of the small areas the size of the effective breeding population may have been so small
that random genetic drift could have operated effectively, or that selection was more critical
than in a larger, more stable population. It is difficult to test these possibilities because
the selective value of the taxonomic characters is unknown. The observed pattern of variation
and facts of distribution are, however, not contradictory to the above possibilities.

=Microtus montanus codiensis=, new subspecies

     Type.--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 27578, Museum of
     Natural History, University of Kansas, from 3⅕ mi. E and ⅗ mi.
     S Cody, 5020 ft., Park Co., Wyoming; obtained on August 11, 1948,
     by James W. Bee, original number 18-8-11-48.

     Range.--In northwestern Wyoming eastward from the Absaroka and
     Wind River ranges into the western part of the Big Horn Basin.

     Diagnosis.--A relatively large Microtus montanus; tail actually
     and relatively long; hind foot actually but not relatively large;
     skull large; zygomatic expanse actually and relatively large;
     alveolobasilar length relatively large; upper molar tooth-row
     relatively long; color relatively light, not reddish.

     Comparisons.--As compared with the specimens of M. m. nanus
     from Idaho, the size is larger (see diagnosis and measurements).
     Certain proportions which differ from those of nanus and which
     are not in close agreement with the observed differences with age
     in specimens of nanus of a size comparable to codiensis are
     relatively large alveolobasilar length, relatively long alveolar
     length of upper molar tooth-row, relatively wide-spreading
     zygomatic arches, and relatively long tail. The color in
     codiensis is lighter than in nanus. As compared to the new
     subspecies named below from the Big Horn Mountains to the east,
     codiensis is of similar size in head-body length, but has a
     relatively as well as actually longer tail; the hind foot averages
     longer; the upper molar tooth-row is relatively longer; the color
     is slightly paler and less grizzled; the bullae are larger and less
     flattened; the angle formed at the suture between the basioccipital
     and basisphenoid bones is less acute; and the region of the suture
     is less prominently elevated between the bullae when viewed from
     the ventral aspect. The pterygoid plates mesial and posterodorsal
     to the posterior end of the last upper molar are less fenestrated,
     and the incisive foramina are less constricted posteriorly.

     Measurements.--The average and the extremes for some measurements
     of 34 males and females, 27 from the type locality and 7 from other
     localities in the range assigned to this subspecies, are as
     follows: total length, 165 (146-186); length of tail, 44.2 (35-55);
     hind foot, 19.6 (17-21); condylobasilar length of the skull, 25.5
     (24.0-27.5); zygomatic breadth, 15.6 (14.7-16.6); alveolar length
     of upper molar tooth-row, 6.6 (6.2-7.0); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.8
     (8.1-9.5); lambdoidal breadth, 12.0 (11.2-12.8). As an indication
     of variability and for comparison with other series the coefficient
     of variability and two times the standard error of the mean for
     each measurement in this series are included in Table 1. The
     averages for some measurements of 27 topotypes are as follows:
     total length, 162; length of tail, 45.5; hind foot, 19.9;
     condylobasilar length, 25.6; palatilar length, 14.0; molar series,
     6.6; alveolobasilar length, 14.9; zygomatic breadth, 15.6;
     interorbital breadth, 3.5; lambdoidal breadth, 12.1; prelambdoidal
     breadth, 8.9; depth of braincase, 7.8.

Discussion.--Three species of Microtus were collected by James W. Bee at the type locality.
Microtus montanus codiensis, Microtus longicaudus mordax, and Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus
were taken in the same runways in the same meadow, at the same time. Microtus ochrogaster haydeni,
although not taken at this locality, occurs in the Big Horn Basin. These four species differ
in their geographic ranges, being largely allopatric, except M. montanus and M. longicaudus
which are sympatric. Although the different species have ecological preferences and habits
which differ, several species of Microtus may occur together in local areas such as the above.
Certain of the characteristics of M. m. codiensis are intermediate between those of the species
M. montanus on one hand and those of the other three species on the other hand. Could interspecific
hybridization between "good species" of Microtus take place in nature and possibly alter the
characteristics of a local population?

=Microtus montanus zygomaticus=, new subspecies

     Type.--Male, adult, skin and skull, No. 32761, Museum of Natural
     History, University of Kansas, from Medicine Wheel Ranch, 9000 ft.,
     28 mi. E Lovell, Big Horn County, Wyoming; obtained by R. Freiburg,
     original number 105.

     Range.--The Big Horn Mountains of north-central Wyoming.

     Diagnosis.--A large Microtus montanus with a relatively short
     tail; short molar series; broad zygomatic arches well rounded in
     lateral outline when viewed from above; small and flattened bullae;
     raised basioccipito-basisphenoid suture.

     Comparisons.--For comparison with M. m. codiensis from the
     west, on the other side of the Big Horn Basin, see the account of
     that subspecies. In comparison with nanus this subspecies is
     slightly paler, in this respect showing more resemblance to
     codiensis although not so pale, and more grizzled or unevenly
     colored. This difference in color between zygomaticus and
     codiensis may not be of taxonomic significance. From both the
     topotypes of nanus, and the series of it from Wyoming,
     zygomaticus differs on the average in having a relatively shorter
     tail, a relatively shorter upper molar tooth-row, relatively more
     rounded and relatively more wide-spread zygomatic arches, and
     smaller more flattened bullae.

     Measurements.--Average and extreme measurements of 24 adult males
     and females from several localities here referred to M. m.
     zygomaticus are as follows: total length, 159(150-175); length of
     tail, 37.6(31-46); hind foot, 18.6(17-20); condylobasilar length of
     the skull, 25.3(24.2-26.7); zygomatic breadth, 15.3(14.1-16.7);
     alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.2 (5.7-6.8);
     prelambdoidal breadth, 8.7(8.3-9.4); lambdoidal breadth,
     11.9(11.0-12.5). Average and extreme measurements of a series of 12
     adult male topotypes are as follows: total length, 159(144-174);
     length of tail, 36.4 (30-41); hind foot, 18.2(16-20);
     condylobasilar length of skull, 25.8(24.7-26.7); alveolobasilar
     length, 14.8(13.8-15.3); palatilar length, 13.8 (12.7-14.2);
     alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.4(5.9-6.6); zygomatic
     breadth, 15.9 (15.0-16.7); interorbital breadth, 3.6(3.4-3.7);
     lambdoidal breadth, 12.1 (11.5-12.5); prelambdoidal breadth,
     8.6(8.3-8.9); depth of braincase, 8.0 (7.6-8.3).

Discussion.--This subspecies is separated from M. m. codiensis to
the west by the Big Horn Basin. A series from along Buffalo Creek, 27
mi. N, 1 mi. E Powder River, 6075 ft., in Natrona County, Wyoming, is
intermediate between the topotypes of zygomaticus and nanus in the
characters cited above as distinguishing the two, but shows greater
resemblance to zygomaticus in the shape of the zygomatic arch, in
color which is paler than in topotypes of zygomaticus, and in the
short hind foot. On these and on geographic grounds this population is
referred to zygomaticus. Unfortunately we cannot be certain in many
cases that an intermediate condition in a certain character indicates a
genetically intermediate population and therefore true intergradation
between the two subspecies to which the population is geographically
intermediate. The topotypes of this subspecies are the most distinct of
all the series which I have studied from the eastern Rocky Mountains, in
terms of the degree of morphological departure from the norm for the
species. After zygomaticus the following populations are arranged
according to their degree of deviation from this norm (codiensis
deviates most): topotypes of codiensis, fusus and a population from
southern Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and lastly the nanus-caryi
complex. Within the latter group, as I have mentioned, there are a
number of local variants most of which do not differ significantly and
do not conform to any geographic pattern. Washakie Co.: 9 mi. E, 5 mi. N Tensleep, 7400 ft.,
     1. Johnson Co.: 7½ mi. W, 1 mi. S Buffalo, 6500 ft., 3; Big
     Horn Mountains, 3 (USBS).

     51:131-134, August 23, 1938; Warren, The Mammals of Colorado, Univ.
     of Okla. Press, p. 229, 1942.

     Type.--Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 61281, Museum of
     Vertebrate Zoology; 2½ miles east of summit of Cochetopa Pass,
     Saguache County, Colorado; Sept. 21, 1933; collected by Annie M.
     Alexander; original number 2568. Type not seen by me.

     Range.--Southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.

     Comparisons.--For comparison with M. m. nanus, the subspecies
     to the northward, see the preceding account of that subspecies. For
     comparison with M. m. amosus the subspecies to the west see Hall
     (1938) and Durrant (1952). I have not examined specimens of
     amosus.

     Measurements.--Average and extreme measurements for 17 adults
     including both males and females from several localities in
     southern Colorado are as follows: total length, 160 (136-179);
     length of tail, 42 (35-55); hind foot, 19.2 (17-23); condylobasilar
     length of the skull, 25.2 (24.0-26.0); zygomatic breadth, 15.0
     (14.1-15.5); alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.4
     (6.0-6.7); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.7 (8.3-9.2); lambdoidal
     breadth, 11.7 (11.1-12.6).

     Average and extreme measurements of 4 adults (2 males and 2
     females) from the type locality and 11 adults (4 males and 7
     females) from other localities in southern Colorado are as follows:
     total length, 162 (157-168), 157 (137-169); length of tail (means
     only), 44.5, 40.5; hind foot, 18.8 (18-19), 18.6 (18-23);
     condylobasilar length of skull, 24.5 (24.0-24.7), 25.2 (24.3-26.1);
     alveolobasilar length, 14.2 (13.9-14.5), 14.6 (14.1-15.1);
     palatilar length, 13.2 (13.0-13.4), 13.5 (13.1-14.2); alveolar
     length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.3 (6.0-6.6), 6.4 (6.3-6.7);
     zygomatic breadth, 15.0 (14.3-15.5), 14.9 (14.1-15.5); interorbital
     breadth, 3.5 (3.3-3.6), 3.5 (3.3-3.7); lambdoidal breadth, 11.8
     (11.1-12.6), 11.7 (11.2-12.3); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.6
     (8.3-9.2), 8.8 (8.3-9.0); depth of braincase, 7.5 (7.2-7.8), 7.6
     (7.1-7.9).

Discussion.--There is no sharp boundary between M. m. fusus of southern Colorado and the subspecies
to the north, M. m. nanus. Although the line separating these two subspecies is drawn somewhat
arbitrarily, on the whole the samples from north of this line more closely resemble nanus.
All of the means for total length given above are larger than the maximum given in Hall's description
of fusus. The caudal index (38 and 35% in two series) is slightly larger than that cited by
Hall (33.3%) and is not significantly different from that in nanus (35.2%). The color in both
young and old mice is variable, but in general is more yellowish, and less grayish, than in
any other series studied.

There is a large area in western Colorado and eastern Utah, between the known ranges of M.
m. fusus and M. m. amosus from which there are no specimens. Probably the species occurs only
at certain places in this arid region which seems to be a partial barrier to the species.

Specimens of M. montanus from northern New Mexico have been referred
previously to M. m. arizonensis. When he named M. m. fusus, Hall
mentioned its resemblance to arizonensis in reddish coloration, but
pointed out that fusus is less reddish. Of six specimens from Valle
Santa Rosa, Jemez Mountains (USBS), 8500 ft., Rio Arriba County, New
Mexico, three are immature, and the skulls of the remaining specimens
are damaged. In reddish color and relatively large size these few
specimens resemble arizonensis more than fusus although the locality
of occurrence is closer to the geographic range of the northern fusus
than to that of arizonensis. The identification of these specimens as
arizonensis is provisional; additional specimens are needed from the
area, 200 miles wide, which separates the ranges as now known of
arizonensis in Arizona from the occurrence in New Mexico. There is a
single specimen from this area, the damaged skull of which prevents
conclusive identification. The specimen is either M. montanus or M.
mexicanus, and is from Nutria, on the southern edge of the Zuni
Mountains (USBS). Detailed comparison of fusus and arizonensis is
not attempted here although it may be stated that in several characters
fusus is intermediate between arizonensis to the south and nanus
to the north. Lake Co.: Independence Pass, 12,095 ft., 2 (Chi).

Some measurements not given above are included in Table 1, together with the number of specimens
and the sex if restricted to one sex. So that the variability can be evaluated more adequately,
the coefficient of variability and 2 times the standard error of the mean are included for
the measurements in two series. The series consist of all the adult specimens (with a condylobasilar
length of 24.0 mm. or more) of both sexes from the areas specified. Various barriers are shown
in Fig. 2 for comparison with the distributions of the subspecies and the localities of known
occurrence shown in Fig. 1. Microtus montanus has not been taken in the Black Hills area of
extreme northeastern Wyoming. Suitable montane habitat is present and both Microtus pennsylvanicus
insperatus and Microtus longicaudus longicaudus occur there. The arid basin of the Powder River
presumably is a barrier that has prevented M. montanus from reaching this area.
