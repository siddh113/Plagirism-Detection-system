The Illustrated War News.

2--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

THE GREAT WAR. That sovereign message to his  heroic soldiers--such as his ancestor Henry V.
might have  addressed to  his 10,000  long-enduring conquerors  on the night  of  Agincourt--was
nobly  supplemented  by  this passage  from  the following  day's Speech  from  the  Throne:
"My  Navy  and Army  continue, throughout  the  area of  conflict,  to  maintain  in full 
measure  their glorious traditions.  We watch and  follow their steadfastness  and valour with
thankfulness and  pride, and there is, throughout my  Empire, a fixed determination to  secure,
at whatever  sacrifice, the triumph of  our arms and the vindication of our cause."

The Admiralty stated on  Nov. 11, "This search resulted on  Oct. 30 in the 'Königsberg'  being
discovered by  H.M.S.  'Chatham'  (Captain Sidney  R. Drury-Lowe, R.N.)  hiding in  shoal water
about six  miles up  the Rufigi Ritter.... (German East  Africa) ... She is now imprisoned,
and unable to do any further harm."--[Photo. by Elliott and Fry.]

Captain  Glossop received  the following  message from  the First  Lord of the  Admiralty:
"Warmest  congratulations on  the brilliant  entry of  the Australian  Navy into  the war,
and the  signal service  rendered to  the Allied cause and to peaceful commerce by the destruction
of the 'Emden.'"

While it fell to H.M.A.S. "Sydney" to bring the "Emden" to action, another vessel  of  the
Australian  Navy,  the  "Melbourne,"  also joined  in  the pursuit. The  Admiralty stated 
that a "large  combined operation  by fast cruisers against the  'Emden' has been for some
time  in progress. In this search,  which covered  an immense  area, the  British cruisers
have been aided  by  French,  Russian,  and Japanese  vessels  working  in  harmony. H.M.A.S.
'Melbourne' and 'Sydney' were also included in these movements."

At whatever sacrifice! And that promises  to be terrible. For what will be the  sacrifice entailed
by two  years of  war--to put  its duration  at a moderate estimate--if our casualties in life
and limb alone (compared with which our  millions of  money are  as nothing)  amounted, according
to an official statement in  Parliament, to about 57,000 of all  ranks up to the end of October,
and it is believed  that 10,000 at least must be added for the first ten  days of November?
Of  course, by far the  larger portion of those casualties  are "wounded," of whom,  according
to one of  the Netley authorities, nine in ten at least ought to recover; while those casualties
also include "missing," or "prisoners," of  whom the Germans claim to have now  more than 
16,000 in  their keeping.  In the  Boer War  our "wounded" amounted to 22,829, of which only
2018 proved fatal cases; while our total casualties  for over  two and  a-half years  of warfare,
including 13,250 deaths from  disease--which, in every  campaign, is always far  more fatal
than  lead or  steel--figured up  to 52,204,  as compared  with 57,000  in France and Belgium
for only three  months, or considerably more than twice the number of men (26,000) whom we
landed in the Crimea; while the purely British contingent  of Wellington's "Allies"  at Waterloo
was  returned at something like 24,000.

[Continued overleaf.

                                THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--3

Much has been said of the elaborate character of the German entrenchments, and of the British
genius for comfort developed in our  own lines, but it is doubtful  whether anything done 
by either  side in that  direction has surpassed the chef-d'oeuvre  of an ingenious French
engineer  shown in our illustration. At one point in the  French trenches not seven hundred
yards from those of the enemy, and within  two miles of the German artillery, he constructed
an up-to-date bathing  establishment, with a heating apparatus and  a  shower-bath! The  apartment
was  fitted  with a  stove,  benches, clothes-pegs,  and  curtains;  and  adjoining the  salle
de  douches,  or shower-bath room, was  fitted up a salle de coiffure.  There was even talk
of enlivening the bathing hour with music and a topical revue.

4--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

It was stated recently that two Zeppelins, armed with machine-guns, circle continually  on
guard  above  the  Kaiser's  private  apartments  in  his headquarters at Coblentz.

It  must  be  remembered,  too, that  the  casualties  referred  to--being confined to  "the
western area of  the war"--do not include  our losses at sea, which  comprise few "wounded"
and  no "missing." At sea  it is either neck  or  nothing, sink  or  swim:  a  modern  battle-ship,
if  holed  and exploded, like  the Good  Hope and  the Monmouth off  the coast  of Chile, going
to  the bottom,  and most  of her crew  with her,  like Kempenfelt's oaken Royal George--

  Brave Kempenfelt is gone,
    His victories are o'er;
  And he and his eight hundred
    Will plough the waves no more.

Thus if our casualties at sea, which are mainly of one kind only, be added up,  they will 
probably be  found  to exceed  our deaths  on land,  which are  always  much less  numerous
than  other  kinds  of losses;  yet  the mortality of our  battlefields has been mournful 
enough, especially among officers--where the death percentage has been higher than in any other
war we ever waged.

On  the other  hand, the  Germans  have had  to  pay a  fearful price  for the  death-toll
they  have  exacted of  us and  our  Allies, seeing  that, according to their own official
admission,  their casualties to the end of September amounted to over 500,000 for  the Prussian
army alone, while the corresponding  figures for  Bavaria, Würtemberg,  Baden, and  other States
have to  be added;  so that the  estimate of Mr.  Hilaire Belloc  that the total losses of
the Germans up to  date must be somewhere  near a million and three-quarters men would appear
to be not very far out.

Well now, supposing  that the war were  to last for two  years, it follows that, at  the same
rate of  loss, the German  casualties would  amount to 12,250,000, which  is almost unthinkable.
Its  very destructiveness should tend to shorten the duration of this  terrible war. As Mr.
Asquith said at the opening of Parliament, in a curiously cryptic and significant passage:
"The war  may last long. I  doubt myself if it  will last as long  as many people originally
predicted." God grant that this may be so!

But in  the meantime there are  no signs of  any abatement of fury  on the part of the Imperial
Hun of Berlin, who stamps, and struts, and rages like Pistol on the field of Agincourt; and
"Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat!" is  ever the burden of  his objurgations. How
different  from the calm, serene, dignified  utterances of our own gracious  Sovereign and
the despatches of  his Generals are the  minatory rantings of the  Kaiser, his von Klucks,
and  his Crown Princes of Bavaria, with  their vicious appeals to the  worst passions of their
soldiers against the English  as the most bitterly hated of all their foes! To enumerate his
qualities: indomitable courage, keen  intelligence, broad humanity,  is to gild refined  gold.
At the call of  duty he visited the  Army and the Indian  soldiers in France, despite  his
eighty-two  years;  there  he  caught  a  chill  and  passed peacefully away.  The message
to  Lady Roberts by Field-Marshall  Sir John French will find universal echo: "...Your  grief
is shared by us who mourn the loss of a much-loved chief ... It seems a fitter ending to the
life of so great  a soldier that he  should have passed  away in the midst  of the troops he
loved so well and within the sound of the guns."

6--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

When the  "Niger" was torpedoed,  Captain Muir was  on the bridge  and was severely injured
by the explosion,  but remained  at his post  till every officer and man had  left the ship.
He was taken ashore at  Deal in a boat and had to be at once placed in hospital.--[Photo. by
Russell.]

Most bitterly hated, but at the  same time most formidable--as the Germans themselves now 
generally admit, and  hence all those tears  of rage--hinc illae lacrymae. Even when the Prussian
Guards--not to speak of the vaunted Brandenburgers and Bavarians--can make no  impression on
the British lines in Belgium, it should at last break  in upon the German General Staff that
they are  somewhat out in  their calculations. The word  "contemptible" is never used now in
relation to Sir  John French's army, and it will be used still less when this army shall have
been reinforced by the million of men apart altogether  from the  Territorials which are  now
under  training to supplement it,  while a further million  has now, in turn,  been asked for
and will  be cheerfully raised,  with the help  of the additional  vote of credit for  £250,000,000--which
was just about  the cost of the  Boer War, and  £25,000,000 more  than the  French indemnity
of 1870--which  will be willingly granted by Parliament  for the conduct of a war  that is
said to be costing  us about £7,000,000  a week. When a  young man throws  all his soul  into
his  training  and  ardently wants  to  become  a soldier,  his progress will be at least three
times as quick as that of the dull, driven conscript;  and that  is  why Lord  Kitchener  has
told  us  that the  new million-man'd army which popularly bears his name, though it might
just as well be called after the King--has already been making a wonderful advance towards
field-efficiency.

The "Niger," a  torpedo-gunboat of 810 tons, built in  1892, was torpedoed by a  German submarine
while  lying off Deal about  noon on the  11th, and foundered. The Admiralty stated: "All the
officers and 77 of the men were saved; two of the men are severely and two slightly injured.
It is thought there was no loss of life."--[Photo. by L.N.A.]

The  English  writer  of  one  of   the  many  war-books  now  before  the public--"The German
Army From  Within," by one who has served  in it as an officer, tells us that  he calculates
one of our "Tommies"  to be at least equal to three "Hans Wursts"; and when the personal equation
is taken into account--the value  of individual  character and  initiative--the estimate will
not seem to be exaggerated. In fact, it has been proved to be correct by the opinion of  all
our best judges in the field itself,  as well as by the results of the fighting when  the odds
against us have been invariably three  to one,  in spite  of which  we have  always managed,
not only  to maintain our ground, but also to encroach on that of our antagonists.

Hence it follows that a so-called  "Kitchener" army of a million men ought to have for us a
military value  of at least three millions as against the Germans--the more so since their
best first-line troops have already been used up, and  replaced with beardless boys and  most
corpulent greybeards. This is not  a fanciful description; it corresponds with  the reports
sent home by "Eye-Witness" at Headquarters  and other reliable observers; while there is  an
absolute  consensus of  statement that  our soldiers  enjoy a commissariat  system which  is
at  once the  admiration  of their  French friends and  the sheer  envy and  despair of their
German foes.  The fact alone that our  men are better found  and better fed than  the enemy
gives them  an advantage  over and  above their  three-to-one equivalent  of the individual
kind.  Wrecked and  ruined houses  with their  walls leaning  over and tottering, about to
fall in ruin, and  the heaps of littered débris in the street tell a fearful  tale of what
the havoc from  a bombardment by heavy projectiles means for the hapless inhabitants of the
place. The tremendous force of the impact with which the  shells crash down is shown at the
same time by the  man seen in the  foreground of the photograph  standing up to the waist in
one of the gaping cavities in the ground that the shells make where they strike. In  some of
the houses they smash  through from roof to cellar.--[Photo. by Illus. Bureau.]

8--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

Major the  Hon. William Cadogan, son  of Earl Cadogan, and  Equerry to the Prince of Wales,
was killed while  commanding the 10th Hussars in place of the Colonel, who  had been wounded.
Major Cadogan had  been sharing in the work  of  the  infantry  in  the trenches.  He  served
in  South  Africa, and  last year  accompanied  the Prince  of Wales,  who  travelled as  the
"Earl  of Chester,"  on  a  visit to  Germany,  where  our photograph  was taken.--[Photograph
by Illus. Bureau.]

Besides, they  have sources of inspiration--have  our "Tommies"--denied to their  Teutonic
antagonists.  General von  Kluck, Commander  of the  First German Army, has  described a visit
of  the dread War Lord to  the line of the Aisne  "behind the line  of fire"; and the  "Hochs"
with which  he was greeted  by a  Prussian Grenadier  regiment. But  what are  those guttural
"Hochs"  compared  with  the  ringing  cheers which  were  evoked  by  the presence of  Lord
Roberts  on the occasion  of his last  visit to  his old comrades-in-arms  of  the  Indian
Army, now  confronting  those  Prussian Grenadiers on  the line of  the Yser? When Lord  Roberts
was made  a Peer, after  his  march  from  Cabul  to Candahar,  he  chose  as  his  heraldic
supporters a Gurkha and a Gordon Highlander,  who had done so much to help him on to victory;
and it is  pretty certain that he would have desired no more congenial and  appropriate manner
of death than he  has found, at the age of  eighty-two, as an  inspiring visitor to  the lines
of  the gallant troops of all  kinds whom he himself  had so often led to  victory. It has
been said that no  man can be called happy until  his death, and certainly no one was ever
more felicitous in  the manner of his end than the veteran hero, the blameless "Bayard" of
the British Army, who has well been called one of Ireland's greatest Englishmen.

Yet his name  will continue to serve  as an inspiration to  the Army which adored him;  and
doubtless his  last moments  were soothed by  the thought that  the soldiers  whom he  so fervently
loved had  just added  to their laurels by the brave  repulse on the Yser of two  Brigades,
or a Division, of the boasted Prussian Guards, forming  the very flower and kernel of the Kaiser's
army. And news also must have reached the conqueror of Paardeburg and Pretoria  that the  German-prompted
and German-paid  rebellion against the Union of  which he had laid the foundation-stone--not
with the trowel of an architect, but with the sword of a soldier--was collapsing under the
well-directed blows of  such an Imperial patriot and  statesman as General Botha, proud to
wear the uniform of the hero of Candahar.

Thus the last  hours of our veteran Field-Marshal must  have been consoled with the reflection
that, in spite of the fact of all his warnings and his exhortations having fallen on deaf ears,
victory was gilding our arms, as well as those  of our Allies, all round;  and that the loss
of  two of our cruisers  off the  coast of  Chile  had been  more than  offsetted by  the destruction
of the  notorious  commerce-destroyer Emden  in  the seas  of Sumatra  and the  cornering of
the equally  elusive Königsberg  among the palm-trees  of an  East  African  lagoon--fit incident
for  the pages  of Captain  Marryat or  Mr. George  Henty,  beloved of  the boy-devourers 
of stirring adventure books.

During  the last  week two  rivers have  again formed  the main  scenes of action in the far-extended
theatre of war--one the Yser, in Belgium, where the  advance of  the Germans  on  Calais  has
been  "stone-walled" by  the Allies; and  the other on the  Vistula, in Poland, where  the
Russians, by sheer  force  of numbers  and  superior  strategy, made  very  considerate progress
in  their march on Berlin;  so that, on the  whole, the horoscope remained  most favourable
to the  Allies and  the ultimate  attainment of their Common object.

                                THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--9

In the recent  victorious operations of the Russian Army  the cavalry have taken a conspicuous
part. The  Headquarters announcement from Petrograd of November 10 said: "To the east of Neidenburg
near the station of Muschaken (in  East Prussia,  about two  miles from  the frontier),  Russian
cavalry defeated  a German  detachment which  was guarding  the railway,  captured transport,
and blew up two bridges over  the railway. On the 8th inst. our cavalry forced one  of the
enemy's cavalry divisions,  which was supported by a  battalion of rifles, to  retreat towards
Kalisz (near  the border of German Poland)." The above drawing  shows an engagement in Hungary
between an Austro-Hungarian  force and a body  of Russian cavalry who  had crossed the Carpathians
from Galicia.

10--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

Dixmude, after  a comparative  lull since  it was  first bombarded  by the Germans, recently
became once more the  objective of a fierce  attack and fell into the  enemy's hands. The afternoon
communiqué issued  in Paris on November 11 said: "At the end of  the day (i.e., the 10th) the
Germans had succeeded in taking possession of Dixmude.  We are still holding on to the outskirts
of this village, on the  canal from Nieuport to Ypres, which has been  strongly  occupied.
The  struggle  has  been  very fierce  at  these points." The late French communiqué issued
the same night said: "The enemy throughout the day continued his effort of yesterday without
achieving any fresh results....  He made vain  attempts to  debouch from Dixmude  on the left
bank of the Yser."--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]

                               THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--11

Although  the  Germans  undoubtedly  scored  a  slight  success  by  their occupation of Dixmude,
they did so  at enormous cost. It was reported from Amsterdam on the  11th that 4000 Germans
severely wounded  in the fighting round Dixmude  had reached  Liége. Dixmude was  for three
weeks gallantly defended by  French Marines. The  town is now little  more than a  heap of
ruins. As our photographs  show, the fine old church of  St. Jean has been almost  completely
wrecked,  and the  Hotel  de Ville  has suffered  great damage. It has been pointed out that
the military value of Dixmude to the Germans  is not  very great,  as  it does  not  form part
of the  Allies' defensive line,  but was  held as a  bridge-head on the  east bank  of the
Yser.--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]

12--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

Dixmude, on the  Yser, suffered terribly during the earlier  stages of the great battle  in
West Flanders.  It was stated  on October 27  that French Marines holding the  town had withstood
a continuous  attack lasting forty hours,  at the  end  of which  the  place  was in  ruins.
Mr. E.  Ashmead Bartlett, who visited  Dixmude on October 21, wrote  (in the "Telegraph"):
"The town is not very big, and  what it looked like before the bombardment I cannot  say....
An infuriated  German army corps were  concentrating the fire of  all the field guns  and heavy
howitzers  on it at the  same time. There was not an inch that was not  being swept by shells.
The  church at Nieuport, which dated  from the  fifteenth century,  was restored  in 1903,
and its massive  baroque tower,  visible from  afar,  could be  easily avoided  by artillerymen
capable of  accurate aim  and desirous  of sparing  a sacred building. Nieuport has at least
twice  before in history been the scene of conflict.  In 1489  it made  a  stubborn resistance
to an  attack by  the French, and  near it,  in July 1660,  was fought the  Battle of  the
Dunes between the Dutch and the Spaniards.--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]

The bursting  shrapnel marking  the line  of flight  of that  dread "steel dove," the Taube,
comes from a new kind of anti-aircraft gun at the front. This  weapon, generally  used to 
fire a  stream of  shrapnel, also  fires shells  containing a  composition for  setting aircraft
on fire,  and its range-finder marks both the height  of an aeroplane and its speed.--[Drawn
by A. Forestier from a Sketch by H.C. Seppings Wright.]

We  see here  the  finale of  a  fierce air-fight  near  Rheims. A  German "Aviatik" biplane
passed overhead and  a French biplane with a machine-gun went  at  it,  There was  a  hot 
contest  until  suddenly a  French  shot struck  the "Aviatik's"  motor. Taking  fire instantly,
the German  craft fell  blazing  to  the ground,  where  it  burned  to  a cinder  with  its

The German base hospital for the troops  in the coast battles and at Ypres was stationed  at
Bruges when  our photograph was taken.  The illustration shows  two wounded  Belgians--one
who  has just  been lifted  out from  an ambulance-wagon is on a stretcher; the other stands,
a grimly picturesque, overcoated and "hooded" figure, in the centre. Among the group of soldiers
are sailor-garbed  men of the Marine  brigade, brought to Flanders  to aid in  garrisoning
Antwerp  and  hold  the coast  batteries  near Ostend  and Zeebruggen. For  the time being
the  entire city of Bruges,  it is stated, has been converted into one immense hospital owing
to the crowds of German wounded almost hourly  arriving there, while trains  with wounded soldiers
are continually leaving for Germany.--[Photo. by Record Press.]

In our last issue we gave a photograph of a Galician town bombarded by the Russians, proving
that  they carefully avoid the  destruction of churches. The German gunners, on the contrary,
show no respect for the House of God, although their Emperor so often  claims Divine approval.
The havoc wrought by  German shells  in French  and Belgian  churches and  cathedrals stands
recorded  in countless  photographs  and other  illustrations,  to form  a permanent Indictment
of Germany's methods  of warfare that will  make her name execrated by  posterity. In the present
instance not  only the church itself  was  destroyed, but  the  very  graves  were  torn open,
and  the bodies  and bones  of  the  desecrated dead  flung  from  their places  of rest--[Facsimile

It has been  pointed out by a Naval correspondent  that the German bayonet of which  one edge
is a  saw is not  really quite the barbarous  weapon it seems,  but is  similiar  to that 
carried by  pioneers  in British  naval landing-parties, for use in sawing wood. The toothed
edge, he mentions, is so far from  the point that only  by the rarest chance could  it enter
the body of an enemy. It would be interesting to know whether the two bayonets British and
German--are exactly  similar. Another  account of  the German weapon states  that the saw-edge
begins only  six inches from  the point, quite near  enough thereto, one  would imagine, to
"enter the body  of an enemy."  Inset is  an enlargement  of the  German saw-bayonet--[Photo.

Dixmude, the name of  which little West Flanders town on  the Yser all the world  knows  now,
after  being heroically  defended  against  persistent night-and-day  attacks and  bombardments
at  all hours,  was taken  by the reinforced Germans after a forty-hours  renewed attack on
November 11. The defenders, however, held  out in the outskirts of the  town, and could not
be dislodged. The post is not part  of the Allied main line, but rather of value as a  bridge-head
over the river. The French  naval officer who sent the  photographs shown  above was  one of
the defenders  until he  had to withdraw wounded.  When he  was there  Dixmude had  been defended
by 6000 French  sailors,  reinforced  at  the  end of  October  by  1500  Algerian soldiers.

One  of War's  "little ironies"  finds illustration  in our  photograph. A great conflict such
as that now being waged is  full of contrasts: grins, pathetic, sometimes  not without a  suggestion
of humour. That  the German Marine should be  told off in a  pretty rural district to  round
up cattle for food for the  German troops is a case in point.  The sleek and shapely kine which
these sturdy fellows are commandeering plod peacefully along in happy ignorance of  the fact
that they  are prisoners of war  being led to their doom by an  armed guard. If it were not
for  the significance of the weapons  borne by  the  Marines, the  scene would  be  as purely
pastoral as  that immortalised  by  Gray.  It suggests  the  "lowing herd"--with  a difference.--[Photo.

The "Pegasus," an old and small  cruiser, was attacked and disabled by the German cruiser "Königsberg"
(recently trapped  by the "Chatham" in an East African river),  a modern ship of  larger size
and much  heavier metal, at daybreak  on September  20, while  anchored in  Zanzibar harbour
to clean boilers. The "Königsberg"  stole up during the night,  sheltered behind an island
off  the shore and,  easily outranging  the guns of  the "Pegasus," shelled  her helpless 
opponent.  After  that the  German  ship drew  off, leaving the "Pegasus" in a sinking condition
and with 26 men killed and 53 wounded.  Our photograph,  which has  just been  received here,
shows the "Pegasus'" wounded being  transhipped to the Union  Castle liner "Gascon," serving
as a hospital-ship to take the injured to the Cape.

The armed liner "Carmania," in her hour and a-half's fight of September 14 with  the  German
armed  liner  "Cap  Trafalgar," was  hit  by  73 of  her opponent's shells, the splinters making,
it  is stated, some 380 holes all over  the vessel.  Offering  so large  a  target to  gun-fire
as did  the "Carmania"--a ship of great length, standing 60 feet out of the water--she was
saved  from  suffering  more  damage by  the  seamanship  of  Captain Noel  Grant,  R.N., 
her  Captain,  who kept  her  end-on  to  the  enemy. Our  photograph of  the  navigating 
bridge of  the  "Carmania," with  the engine-room telegraphs wrecked  and fragments of metal
strewn about, will give an idea of what those on board went through. It has just reached this
country.--[Photo. by Farringdon Co.]

It is clear that the German incendiary outrages in Belgium and France were premeditated, and
German scientists  devised special apparatus for setting fire to buildings. Our informant,
who  bought some incendiary disks from a German soldier  near Antwerp, states  that every man
carries  twenty bags, each containing  about 300 disks.  Mr. Bertram Blount, the  analyst,
found the disks consist of nitro-cellulose, or gun-cotton. They may be lit, even when wet,
with a match  or cigarette-end, and  burn for eleven  or twelve seconds,  emitting  a  strong
five-inch  flame,  and  entirely  consuming themselves. The  Germans throw  them alight  into
houses.  The photographs show  (1) a  bag of  disks  as supplied  to  German soldiers;  (2)
a  disk burning; and (3) a disk, actual size, before being used.

The German heavy "batteries of position"  are for the most part armed-with the  15 cm.,  or
6-inch  howitzer,  throwing a  shell  of 90  lb. with  an approximate range of 6650 yards.
The  howitzer type of mobile heavy gun is much  favoured for  defensive work  in both  the
German  and the  Austrian armies. The howitzer  is capable of elevation  up to 65 deg.,  the
idea of this  high elevation  being, it  is  stated, to  obtain a  steep angle  of descent
for the shells at  comparatively short ranges, in combination with a high  remaining velocity
so as  to ensure  the penetration  of overhead cover. These  howitzers are  also employed in
siege and  fortress defence warfare. They have  been used along the Aisne positions  as auxiliaries
to the giant Krupp siege-howitzers.

Cavalry  engaged  in   the  Belgian  frontier  battles   are  fighting  in all  sorts  of 
ways:  repeatedly,  for example,  as  infantrymen  in  the trenches.  On  occasion,  also,
they  have even  charged  on  foot,  with bayonet  or with  their lances.  The Life  Guards,
according  to a  letter from  the  front,   charged  the  German  trenches  the   other  day
with bayonets. A  squadron of  French dragoons dismounted  and crept  through a wood  on  foot,
surprising  a  German  infantry company  and  overpowering them  in  close-quarter  fight 
with lances  and  clubbed  carbines.  With

                               THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--25

lances, also,  as our illustration shows,  some of our Bengal  cavalry, in action on foot,
on October 24, at Ramscapelle, near  the Yser, recaptured the village from the Germans. Dismounting
near by, they charged the enemy lance in hand, driving him from  his trenches. Following up
their success, they then forced their way into the village, smashing in doors and windows and
storming house  after  house  in spite  of  fierce resistance  until, assisted by  other troops,
they forced  the enemy out, capturing  guns and many prisoners. The action was particularly
notable.

"Who gives quickly gives twice." That  paraphrase of one of Napoleon's war maxims  in regard
to  the conferring  of distinctions  won  in battle  as speedily as  possible after  the event,
has been  adopted by  the nations engaged  in  the  world-war.  Recommendations for  the  "V.C."
have  been announced as having  been laid before our authorities, many  grants of the "D.S.O."
and  "D.C.M." have already  been garetted; and our  French Allies have awarded the  Legion
of Honour to several officers  and men. Our first photograph shows  a French  General publicly
bestowing  the accolade  on a newly made  Chevalier of the Legion  of Honour. Our second  shows
a German Commander  adorning a  German officer  with  one of  the innumerable  Iron Crosses
the Kaiser is sending round.--[Photos. by Alfieri.]

There  is  something gruesomely  appropriate  in  this photograph  of  the wreckage of  a destroyed
German motor-transport  wagon train,  or convoy, grouped in a  sort of hollow square  about
the graves of  the officers and men  involved in  the destruction  of their  charge. The  place
is  in the Argonne  district, the  tract of  rough  country, between  the sources  of the 
Aisne and  the  Meuse, through  which  the high  road  from Paris  to Verdun passes.  How catastrophe
befell this  particular German  convoy we can  guess. More  than  one of  the enemy's  transport
trains, moving  in this  part  of  the  country,  are recorded  to  have  fallen  victims 
to long-range bombardments by the French artillery as the result of aeroplane reconnoitring
activity--[Photo. by Alfieri.]

Like his father and brothers, Prince Eitel Fritz, the Kaiser's second son, has received the
Iron Cross. It has  not been made known over here how the Prince  won it.  Our illustration,
reproducing  a picture  from a  German paper, may solve  the difficulty. Says the legend: "The
Prince seized the drum of a fallen soldier and led his troops, beating the charge."

One of  the curious fictions about  England now going round  in Germany is one that Sir John
Jellicoe's fleet keeps in hiding lest it should meet the German fleet. German  war-ships, indeed,
scour the North Sea  at all hours to give the Grand Fleet battle!  Our illustration, from a
serious painting published in a German paper, shows them at it.

Early  in the  war, the  Kaiser commissioned  various painters  to produce battle-pictures
of  German  prowess.  The  royal  house  of  Bavaria  has apparently followed suit.  More recently
the Kaiser expressed  a wish that the  British  might meet  the  Bavarians  "just  once"  and
his  wish  was gratified. In depicting a Bavarian cavalry fight with French dragoons, the Bavarian
artist  naturally  represents  the  enemy  as  going  down  like nine-pins. Prince Heinrich,
who figures in the drawing, is the only son of the  late  Prince  Francis  Joseph  of Bavaria,
first  cousin  of  Prince Rupprecht, the Bavarian Crown Prince,  who recently exhorted his
troops to conquer  "our  most hated  foe."  He  also  highly extolled  the  Bavarian cavalry,
who,  he said,  have fought "with  the greatest  fearlessness and extraordinary dash."

It is said that the German garrison at Tsing-tau, which surrendered to the Japanese and British
on November  7, included five battalions of infantry, fire battalions of marine artillery,
one battalion of mechanics, and about 2500 reservists.  After the surrender of  the garrison
a number  of German soldiers are  said to have escaped  in native boats, but  were recaptured.
The defences  were under naval  control. Tsing-tau was  strongly fortified and had about 600
Krupp guns  of various calibre. The photographs show men of  the Third  Sea  Battalion. (1)
On  the march  in  Tsing-tau; (2)  and (3)  Entrenched with  a  machine-gun. Our  correspondent
states that  the photographs  were taken  since the  siege began;  otherwise the  dark band
round the helmet-covers might be taken for a manoeuvres badge.

At  midnight on  November 6--seven  hours  before the  German garrison  of Tsing-tau surrendered,
the central fort  was captured by the Japanese, who took 200  prisoners. The Germans  had made
great efforts to  repair their batteries, but the shell-fire from the  Japanese guns was too
heavy. After the central  fort had  fallen the  Japanese captured at  the point  of the bayonet
other  forts  and  the strong  field-works  connecting  them.  It was  stated that  some 2300
German  prisoners were  taken when  Tsing-tau surrendered. The German  garrison, it is said,
included  four companies of seaman gunners, an equal force of Marines, some cavalry and field
gunners, and a  company of sappers. Probably  the garrison increased after  the war began,
as Germans  from  all parts  of China  gathered  at Tsing-tau  for protection.

Considering  the  amount of  discussion--not  to  say, in  some  quarters, apprehension--to
which  the Zeppelins  have given rise,  singularly little has been heard of them so far  during
the war, and, apart from the Antwerp exploits, they have done practically no damage. On the
other hand, several have been destroyed:  the number has been variously estimated  from two
to six.  One,  said  to  be  the  "LZ10," was  brought  down  in  October  at Grandvilliers,
ten miles from Belfort. Our photographs show: (1) debris of the shattered  framework; and (2)
wreckage of the cars.  Another Zeppelin was destroyed in October by the fire of Russian batteries
near Warsaw, and its broken  remains were taken  to Petrograd  to be examined.  The British
air-raid on Düsseldorf also accounted for one or possibly two.

The  ground occupied  by the  British  troops on  the banks  of the  Aisne consisted, in many
places, of steep hill-sides or cliffs penetrated like a rabbit-warren with  the workings  of
old  stone-quarries. The  officer who sends us the above interesting  sketch writes: "This
cave afforded shelter both from  rain and 'Jack Johnsons'  for several weeks to  ----, a certain
Highland regiment.  The cave consisted  of three long passages  capable of holding a whole
battalion. It had two  entrances, one of which is shown in the sketch. It was dark and dirty,
but with plenty of straw on the ground it made a fairly comfortable refuge. The sketch shows
the part of the cave occupied  by  the  officers  and headquarters."--[Facsimile  Sketch  by

After the  fall of  Tsing-tau on  November 7 the  Admiralty cabled  to the Japanese Minister
of Marine: "The  Board of Admiralty send their heartiest congratulations to  the gallant Army
and  Navy of Japan on  the prosperous and brilliant issue  of the operations which have resulted
in the fall of Tsing-tau." The Japanese  began the blockade on August  27, occupying some neighbouring
islands as  a base.  Mine-sweeping was  the first  task, and then, on September 18, the Japanese
troops landed safely at Lao-shan Bay. They  fought with  great valour  and suffered  considerable
losses.  Their casualties up to November  6 were given as 200 killed  and 878 wounded. In the
final  assault they  had 14  officers wounded and  426 men  killed and wounded. The number
of Germans captured was 2300.--[Photo. by C.N.]

In  his telegram  to the  Japanese Minister  of War  after the  capture of Tsing-tau, Lord
Kitchener said:  "Please accept my warmest congratulations on the success of the operations
against Tsing-tau. Will you be so kind as to express  my felicitations to  the Japanese forces
engaged?  The British Army is proud  to have been associated with its  gallant Japanese comrades
in  this  enterprise."  The  British  force,  under  Brigadier-General  N. Barnardiston, Commanding
the Forces in North China, landed in Lao-shan Bay on September  24. Some Indian troops  also
took part in  the fighting. The Emperor  of Japan  sent a  message  to the  British force 
saying that  he "deeply  appreciates the  brilliant deeds  of  the British  Army and  Navy
co-operating with the Japanese."--[Photo. by C.N.]

Our first photograph shows where the  "Emden" met her fate after landing a party to destroy
the wireless station, the  pole of which is  seen to the left centre of  the photograph. The
Cocos group are  a British possession, and lie in the Indian Ocean,  south-west of Sumatra.
Our second photograph shows the "Emden,"  whose depredations have cost nearly two  and a quarter
millions  sterling. She  was a  light cruiser  of 3350  tons and  25 knots speed, carrying
ten  41-inch guns. Captain Karl von  Müller, the "Emden's" Captain, who  carried out his enterprises
with a fine spirit  of chivalry and  daring  which  we  acknowledge,  was  a  native  of  Blankenburg,
in Brunswick, and was formerly a captain in the Hansa Line. He is a prisoner, unwounded, and
keeps his sword.

H.M.S. "Sydney"  (No. 1)  caught the  commerce-raiding "Emden"  at Keeling Cocos Island and
forced a sharp action  upon her, with the result that the German ship was  driven ashore and
burnt. The "Chatham"  (No. 2) found the "Königsberg," the ship, it will be recalled, which
attacked the "Pegasus," hiding in shoal  water up the Rufigi River, German  East Africa, with
part of her crew entrenched on the banks.  Unable to get at her, she bottled up the "Königsberg"
by sinking colliers  in the only navigable  channel. The "Sydney" is a light cruiser of  5600
tons, launched, as was the "Chatham," in 1911. The "Chatham" was practically  a sister ship
of the "Sydney," but rather smaller,  displacing 5400 tons, The  "Emden" was of 3650  tons;
the "Königsberg" displaced 3400 tons.--[Photos. by Symonds.]

"In this quarter," says Eye-Witness of  the fighting near Ypres on October 29, "we experienced
... the action of the 'minenwerfer,' or trench-mortar. This piece, though light  enough to
be wheeled by two  men, throws a shell weighing 187  lbs. The spherical  shell has a  loose
stem which  is loaded into the  bore and drops out  in flight. It  ranges about 350 yards 
at 45 deg. elevation. The  shell is a thin-walled mine-shell  containing a large charge and
is intended to act with explosive effect, not splinter-effect." The diagram on the left shows
one of the shells and its stem in their most up-to-date form; in the centre is  the trench-mortar
(its wheels off) with a shell in place; below this are  three shells without their stems; on

The Germans, according to paragraphs from their newspapers reprinted here, sneer at the  way
London is guarding against hostile  aircraft by mounting quick-firing guns and searchlights
and putting out many street lamps. They are doing much  the same themselves, however, in the
cities nearest their western frontier. At  Cologne, ever since August, there  has been constant
nervousness  as  to possible  air-raids,  and  searchlights from  elevated points in the city
have swept  the sky nightly, and machine-guns have been set  up on  tall  buildings. At  Düsseldorf
when  our  airmen destroyed  a Zeppelin, the  aviators were fired  at by  machine-guns from
all  over the city.  Our illustration  shows  German machine-guns  in  temporary use  as anti-aircraft
guns.--[Photo. by Photopress.]

Among the French Colonial troops, the Senegalese have done excellent work, both on the Aisne
and, more recently, in Belgium. Our photograph was taken near  Pervyse, a  village on  the
railway  between Dixmunde  and Nieuport, which has been the  scene of many fierce encounters.
In  the Battle of the Aisne,  when  much night  fighting  took  place,  the Senegalese,  it
was reported, whose dark complexions rendered their faces less visible, proved very useful,
and showed extraordinary daring. A favourite ruse was to send them forward at night, and when
they had crawled near to the German lines, to turn  powerful searchlights on  the enemy,  who,
blinded by  the glare, could not  see whence the  attack came.  For  some time  before  that,
however,  the authorities had been  taking precautionary measures in  consequence of the ubiquity
and  restless activity of the  horde of German secret  agents and spies  known  to  be  busily
at work,  seeking  to  spread  sedition  and disaffection among  the natives. To  prevent the
transmission  of military and  other  intelligence to  Constantinople  by  their emissaries,
severe restrictions  have had  to  be  imposed along  the  land-frontiers and  in particular
at ports such as Alexandria,  Port Said and Suez on all persons entering  or  leaving  the
country. All  passports  and  credentials  are subjected to a close scrutiny.--[Photo. by C.N.]

On Sunday, November 15, that brave soldier Albert King of the Belgians was thirty-nine, and
a solemn Mass  was celebrated at  Westminster Cathedral. Cardinal Bourne assisted at the service,
and the ceremonial was of a most impressive and ornate character,  gorgeous vestments, beautiful
music, and the gleam of many lights combining  to make a tout ensemble that suggested some
great  occasion  of  national  thanksgiving,  as,  indeed,  it  was. Scarlet and  green were
the brilliant colour-notes  of the  function. The celebrant of the Mass was Mgr.  Canon Moyes,
other dignitaries taking part in  the  service.  Amongst  the  congregation were  the  children
of  the King  of the  Belgians--Prince Leopold,  Duc de  Brabant; Prince  Charles, Comte  de
Flandre; and  Princess  Marie-José,  of  all  of whom  we  give portraits.--[Photo. by C.N.]

(Reserve) Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who, since they were raised,  have been  in  training at 
Newtown,  Montgomeryshire. The  Welsh Fusiliers have always had a white goat  as a mascot,
drawn from the famous herd of  Cashmere goats which  also supplied  the King's gift.  The animal
given  by his  Majesty to  the  new battalion  was taken  from Windsor  to Newtown under escort,
and was received at  the station by two  men of the 7th Royal Welsh  Fusiliers, who stood with

Nothing  could  give a  better  idea  of  shell-fire than  the  remarkable photograph here
reproduced.  It is a panoramic view of  a German artillery bombardment of advancing  infantry,
and was taken in  three sections, well within  a hundred  and fifty  yards of  some of  the
bursting  shells. The locality  of the  battle  is  in the  Argonne  country  between the 
Upper Aisne and  the Meuse,  where the  French are  having continuous  and stiff fighting.
Men of  the French infantry keeping under cover  in one of their advanced trenches  are seen
in the  left foreground  of the  picture. The object  of  the  actual  fighting  on  the  occasion
was  to  keep  apart the  Third  German  army  as  it  fell  back  towards  prepared  positions
near  the Meuse  and a  force  of reinforcing  troops coming  up from  the direction of Metz.
"To impede the persistent advance of  our ---- corps."

writes a French  correspondent on the spot, the  enemy resisted vigorously and with  his heavy
artillery.  He treated us  to shells with  a veritable prodigality, but  without causing us
very serious losses. In  the forward movement, led by the ---- infantry regiment, on an important
position that had to  be taken,  practically every  soldier engaged  was saluted  by six shells.
There  was, though, no 'shyness'  among our men. They  laughed and joked with one  another
as they quitted the trenches  to move forward over the  open. By  the  evening the  enemy's
position  had  been taken."  Both ordinary shrapnel and high-explosive 15-c.m.  shells from
the German heavy position-batteries of howitzers, which weapons the Germans prefer for such
work, although they  also use guns of the same  calibre, are seen bursting in front of the
French troops.

Nieuport has been badly damaged by  the German bombardment, and it is said that half the houses
in it appear  to have been struck by shells, yet that it has not been so utterly ruined as
some of the surrounding villages. The worst loss  as regards buildings at  Nieuport has been
the  destruction of the  church,  which,  as  many  photographs show  well,  has  been  almost
completely demolished.  It was  a fine  specimen of one  of the  few stone churches found 
in that part  of the country, with  twelfth-century Gothic windows. The walls and pillars stand
bare, the roof has gone, and half the tower, whose bells  lie buried on the ground amid  the
wreckage. Desultory fighting continued at Nieuport after  the main German attack shifted south
to Ypres.--[Photo. by C.N.]

The  inhabitants of  those parts  of France  and Belgium  which are  still groaning under 
the German incubus  are greatly  to be pitied.  Beyond the terrible agony inflicted by the
invaders upon defenceless populations, in the form  of executions and  house-burnings and various
forms  of outrage, there is a great  mass of less drastic but still  intolerable misery to
be borne by  those unfortunate  householders who are  compelled to  house and feed the soldiers
of the enemy. Some  idea of the nature of the infliction to which they  are subjected can be
gathered from such a  drawing as that here  reproduced.  It  shows  some  officers of  the
motor-corps  of  the Nineteenth German Army  Corps asleep in a house upon  which they have
been billeted. The drawing is by a German artist.

48--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

Much hard fighting  on the Yser and elsewhere in  West Flanders has fallen to the lot of the
French bluejackets  of the Naval Brigade, a strong force of whom  were brought  up from  Brest
to reinforce  the Belgians  in their defensive battles near the coast after the retreat from
Antwerp. Attacking side by side with the British, they  retook Ypres on October 13, and after
that held Dixmude for weeks.

"The Kaiser," according to an American who was recently permitted to visit the Imperial headquarters
in  a "small city" on the Meuse,  is a good deal altered in his  appearance. "He wears a dirty
green-grey  uniform, and has an intense earnestness  of expression that seemed to  mirror the
sternness of the  times." He "lives  in a little red-brick  house such as  one would rent in
a London suburb for £50."
