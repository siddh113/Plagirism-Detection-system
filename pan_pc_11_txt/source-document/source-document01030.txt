PERIOD VII

PROBLEMS OF THE NEW CENTURY

1902-1912

CHAPTER I

THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT

[1900]

Theodore Roosevelt was born in New York City, October 27, 1858. He was graduated from Harvard
in 1880. At the age of twenty-three he entered the New York State Assembly, where he served
six years with great credit. Two years he was a "cowboy" in Dakota. He was United States Civil
Service Commissioner and President of the New York City Police Board. In 1897 he became Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, holding this position long enough to indite the despatch which took
Dewey to Manila. He then raised the first United States Volunteer Cavalry, commonly spoken
of as "Rough Riders," and went to Cuba as their lieutenant-colonel. Gallantry at Las Guasimas
made him their colonel, the first colonel, Leonard Wood, having received a brigadier-general's
commission. Returning from the war, Colonel Roosevelt found himself, as by a magic metamorphosis,
Governor of his State, fighting civic battles against growing corporate abuses. He urged compulsory
publicity for the affairs of monopolistic combinations, and was prominently instrumental in
the enactment of the New York Franchise Tax Law.

The party managers in the 1900 convention hoped by making him Vice-President to remove him
from competition for the presidency in 1904. But the most unexpected of the many swift transitions
in his career foiled their calculations and brought him in a moment to the summit of a citizen's
ambition.

The new chief magistrate was no less honest, fearless, or public-spirited than the recent one;
it only remained to be seen whether he were not less astute and cautious. Coming to the office
as he did, he was absolutely unfettered, which, in one of so frank a temperament, might prove
a danger. He was more popular with the people than with politicians. Though highly educated
and used to the best associations, he was more approachable than any of his predecessors. At
a public dinner which he attended, one round of cheers was given him as "the President of the
United States" another as "Roosevelt," and a third as "Teddy." Had McKinley been in his place
a corresponding variation would have been unthinkable.

From a copyrighted photograph by Pach Bros., N. Y. Theodore Roosevelt.

President Roosevelt's temper and method were in pointed contrast to McKinley's. Whereas McKinley
seemed simply to hold the tiller, availing himself of currents that to the eye deviously, yet
easily and inevitably, bore him to his objective, Roosevelt strenuously plied the oar, recking
little of cross currents or head winds, if, indeed, he did not delight in them. Chauncey Depew
aptly styled McKinley "a Western man with Eastern ideas." Roosevelt, "an Eastern man with Western
ideas." This aspect of the new President's character gave him hold on both West and East. Roosevelt
was the first President since William Henry Harrison to bring to his office the vigor and freshness
of the frontier, as he was, anomalously, the first city-born or wealthy-born incumbent.

Theodore Roosevelt, as Lieut.-Colonel of the "Rough Riders."

[1901]

The members of President McKinley's cabinet were invited to retain their portfolios, which
they agreed to do. At the time, Roosevelt was reputed to be the foremost civil service reformer
in the country. Politicians were  soon made aware that the President regarded fitness for office
as the first test. Unfortunately during the presidency of McKinley, some 8000 offices had been
taken out of the competitive lists. During Roosevelt's first term, however, the list of offices
placed under the merit system was greatly extended. Within the twenty-one years from the enactment
of the first national civil service reform law wonders had been accomplished in that more than
one-half of the 300,000 offices in the executive civil service were placed in the classified
competitive service.

President Roosevelt stood for liberal reciprocity with Cuba, urging this, at first, with results
disastrous to party harmony. He was vindicated by public opinion, but learned wisdom. Though
believed to be favorable to a decided easing of custom-house levies, his administration soon
frankly avowed itself unable to proceed further than high- protectionists would follow. The
evidence of his tariff convictions won him strong support in the West, which was prepared to
go greater lengths than he. In the congressional campaign of 1902, ex-Speaker Henderson, of
Iowa, a stanch protectionist, withdrew from public life, as was supposed, rather than misrepresent
himself by acceding to tariff reform or his constituents by opposing it.

Mr. Roosevelt signalized his accession by an effort to make the federal anti-trust law something
more than a cumberer of the statute-book. His inaugural message and innumerable addresses of
his boldly handled the whole trust evil and called for the regulation of capitalistic combinations
in the interest of the public.

Appreciation of the President's attitude on these matters may be assisted by some notice of
the then threatening vigor and universality of the movement toward industrial combination.
Mr. Beck, Assistant Attorney-General of the United States, declared in 1892:

"Excessive capitalization of corporations, dishonest management by their executive officers,
the destruction of the rights of the minority, the theft of public utilities, the subordination
of public interests to private gain, the debauchery of our local legislatures and executive
officers, and the corruption of the elective franchise, have resulted from the facility afforded
by the law to corporations to concentrate the control of colossal wealth in the hands of a
few men . . . . The question presses ever more importunately for decision whether these marvellous
aggregations of capital can be subordinated to the very laws which created them."

Legislation in many States, the enactment of the Sherman anti-trust law by Congress, and the
decision of the Supreme Court in the Trans-Missouri case rendered insecure trust agreements
of the old type, in which constituent corporations surrendered the control of their affairs
to trustees. But the current merely shifted to a different channel, the trust proper giving
way to the giant corporation having the same aims, methods, and efficiency, while, as more
legal, it was less vulnerable.

In the railway world, "community of interest" assumed the place of pooling agreements. The
Union Pacific acquired large holdings from Collis P. Huntington's estate and controlled the
Southern Pacific. The power behind the Southern Railway got control of nearly all the other
Southern railways, including the Atlantic Coast Line, the Plant System, and at last even the
Louisville and Nashville. The New York Central dominated the other Vanderbilt roads. The Pennsylvania
secured decisive amounts of Baltimore and Ohio stock, as well as weighty interests in the Chesapeake
and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western, and so on.

[1902]

Collis P. Huntington.

Great banking establishments, foremost among them the house of J. P. Morgan & Co., took to
financing these schemes. Morgan re-organized the Northern Pacific, and it would forthwith have
pooled issues with the Great Northern but for opposition by the State of Minnesota. James J.
Hill was master of the Great Northern, and confidence existed between him and Morgan.

They wished a secure outlet for the products of the Northwest, also access to Chicago over
a line of their own. After a survey of the field the promoters selected as the most available
for the latter office the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Purchase of shares in this corporation
was quietly begun. Soon the Burlington road was apparently in hand. Prices rose.

Copyright. 1902. by Pach Bros., N. Y. James J. Hill.

The Union Pacific control perceived in the aggression of the two northern lines a menace to
its northwestern and Pacific coast connections. The Union Pacific leader, E. H. Harriman, resorted
to an unexpected coup. He attempted to purchase the Northern Pacific, Burlington and all. A
mysterious demand, set Northern Pacific shares soaring. The stock reached $1,000 a share and
none was obtainable. Panic arose; bankers and brokers faced ruin.

The two sides now declared a truce. The Northern Securities Company was created, with a capital
approaching a billion dollars, to take over the Burlington, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern
stocks.

E. H. Harriman.

The States of Minnesota and Washington, unable in their own courts to thwart this plan, sought
the intervention of the United States Supreme Court. Their suit was vain till the Administration
came to the rescue. At the instance of the Attorney-General, an injunction issued from the
high court named forbidding the Securities Company to receive the control of the roads, and
the holders of the railroad stocks involved to give it over. It was observed, however, that
at the very time of the above proceedings the Southern Railways' power obtained control of
the Louisville and Nashville without jar or judicial obstruction.

While general, the process of confederation was specially conspicuous in the iron and steel
trade. In rapid succession the National Steel Company, the American Sheet Steel Company, and
the American Tin Plate Company were each made up of numerous smaller plants. Each of these
corporations, with a capital from $12,000,000 to $40,000,000, owned the mines, the ships, and
the railways for hauling its products, the mills for manufacturing, and the agencies for sale.
Through the efforts of John W. Gates numerous wire and nail works were combined into the American
Steel and Wire Company. The Federal Steel Company, the American Bridge Company, the Republic
Iron and Steel Company, huge and complete, were dictators each in its field.

John W. Gates.

The Carnegie Steel Company long remained independent. Determined not to enter a "combine,"
Andrew Carnegie sought to fortify his position. He obtained a fleet of ships upon the lakes,
purchased mines, undertook to construct tube works at Conneaut, Ohio, and planned for railroads.
A battle of the giants, with loss and possible ruin for one side or the other, impended. Carnegie
was finally willing to sell. Hence, the United States Steel Corporation capitalized for a billion
dollars. Carnegie and his partners were said to receive about $300,000,000 in bonds of the
new corporation, while the other trusts and the promoters absorbed the stock for their properties
and services. The underwriting syndicate probably realized $25,000,000.

The trust creators extended their operations abroad. In 1901 J. Pierpont Morgan and associates
acquired the Leyland line of Atlantic steamships. British nerves had not recovered tone when
a steamship combination, embracing not only American and British but also German lines and
ship-building firms at Belfast and on the Clyde was announced. Of the great Atlantic companies,
only the Cunard line remained independent. Parliamentary and ministerial assurances of governmental
attention only emphasized the strength of the association.

One effect of this organization at home was to place the Ship Subsidy Bill, which passed the
Senate in 1901, for the time, at least, on the table. The sentiment of the country, especially
of the Middle West, would not permit the payment of public money to a concern commercially
able to defy Britannia on the sea.

The Yankee Peril confronted Londoners when they saw American capital securing control of their
proposed underground transit system. At their tables they beheld the output of food trusts.
One of these, the so-called Beef Trust, called down upon itself in 1902 domestic as well as
foreign anathema.

The failure of the corn crop in 1900, together with a scarcity of cattle, tended to raise the
price of beef. In 1902 outcry became emphatic. Advance in meat values drew forcibly to view
the control held by six slaughtering concerns acting in unison.

The President ordered an investigation, and, as a result, proceedings under the Sherman Act
to restrain the great packers from continuing their alleged combination. A temporary injunction
was granted. The slow machinery of chancery bade fair to work out a decree, but long before
it was on record, alert spirits among the packing firms evolved a new plan not obnoxious to
decrees, but effective for union.

If the public suffered from these phalanxed industries while they ran smoothly, it endured
peculiar evils from the periodical conflicts between the capital and the labor engaged in them.

The Steel Strike of 1901 was a conflict over the unionizing of certain hitherto non-union plants
of the United States Steel Corporation. It resulted in defeat for the strikers and in the disunionizing
of plants.

This strike had no such consequences for the consuming public as attended the anthracite coal
strike of 1902, which was more bitterly fought in that it was a conflict over wages. The standard
of living had been lowered in one of the coal-fields by the introduction of cheap foreign labor.
Now the same process threatened the other coal-field.

A strike ordered by the United Mine Workers began May 12, 1902, when one hundred and forty-seven
thousand miners went out. Though the record was marred at places, they behaved well and retained
to a large degree public sympathy. When the price of anthracite rose from about $5 a ton to
$28 and $30, the parts of the country using hard coal were threatened with a fuel famine and
had begun to realize it. For the five months ending October 12th, the strike was estimated
to have cost over $126,000,000. The operators stubbornly refused to arbitrate or to recognize
the union, and the miners, with equal constancy, held their ranks intact.

The problem of protecting the public pressed for solution as never before. The only suggestion
at first discussed was arbitration. Enforced arbitration could not be effected in the absence
of contract without infringing the workingman's right to labor or to decline to do so; in other
words, without reducing him, in case of adverse decision by arbitration, to a condition of
involuntary servitude. It looked as though no solution would be reached unless State or nation
should condemn and acquire ample portions of the mining lands to be worked under its own auspices
and in a just manner. This course was suggested, but nearly all deemed it dangerously radical;
nor was it as yet likely to be adopted by Congress or by the Pennsylvania legislature, should
these powers be called to deal with the problem.

On October 3 President Roosevelt called the coal operators and President Mitchell of the United
Mine Workers to a conference at the White House, urging them to agree. His effort, at first
seeming unsuccessful, was much criticised, but very few failed to praise it when, a few days
later, it was found to have succeeded completely. An able and impartial commission, satisfactory
to both sides, was appointed by the President to act as arbitrator, both miners and operators
agreeing to abide its decrees. The miners, the four hundred thousand women and children dependent
on them, the poor beginning to suffer from cold, indeed the whole nation, including, no doubt,
the operators, felt relief.

"How much better," said the young President, once, addressing a fashionable assembly, "boldly
to attempt remedying a bad situation than to sit quietly in one's retreat, sigh, and think
how good it would be if the situation could be remedied!"

CHAPTER II

ROOSEVELT'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION, 1901-1905

[1902]

The sentiment noted at the end of the last chapter seemed to be the motive of Mr. Roosevelt's
public life. Not only was he better informed on the whole than almost any President who had
sat in the chair before, but he was a good lawyer, familiar with national and general history
and awake to all contemporary doings, questions, and interests south, west, east, and abroad.
He was also more a man of action and affairs than any of his predecessors. He had, in a very
high degree, alertness, energy, courage, initiative, dispatch. Physically as well as mentally
vigorous, he read much, heard all who could usefully inform him, apprehended easily, decided
quickly, and toiled like Hercules. He was just and catholic in spirit, appreciating whatever
was good in any section of the country or class of people. He respected precedent but was not
its slave. Rather than walk always in ruts with never a jolt, he preferred some risks of tumbling
over hummocks. Few public men of any age or country have more fully met Aristotle's test of
a statesman: "ability to see facts as they exist and to do the things needing to be done."

Copyright. l904. by Pach Bros., N. Y. John Hay, Secretary of State. Each was, to say the least,
the peer of his greatest predecessors in his office. It was mainly to Mr. Root that we were
indebted for starting the Cubans prosperously as an independent nation. His service for the
Philippines so far as it went was not less distinguished; and he effected vitally important
reorganization and reform in the war office.

A well co-ordinated plan was developed whereby army officers were given advanced training in
the various branches of military science as in the European countries. Neither the President
nor Secretary Root advocated a large standing army, but they both strove to bring the army
"to the very highest point of efficiency of any army in the civilized world." The ability of
Secretary Root to inaugurate reforms in a department which when he became its head was overridden
by tradition, was well expressed by President Roosevelt as follows: "Elihu Root is the ablest
man I have known in our governmental service. I will go further. He is the greatest man that
has appeared in the public life of any country, in any position, on either side of the ocean
in my time."

Copyright. 1903. by Clinedinst, Washington. Elihu Root, Secretary of War. [Secretary of State,
July 1905.]

Under Secretary Hay our State Department attained unprecedented prestige, due in part to the
higher position among the nations now accorded us. This result itself Mr. Hay had done much
to achieve; and he passed hardly a month in his office without making some further addition
to the renown and influence of his country. If the United States has--which may be doubted--raised
up diplomatists with Mr. Hay's mastery of international law and practice and his art and skill
in conducting delicate negotiations, we have probably never had his equal in diplomatic initiative,
or in the thorough preparation and presentation of cases. He did not meet occasions merely
but made them, not arbitrarily but for the world's good. Settling the Alaskan boundary favorably
to the United States at every point save one, crumbling with the single stroke of his Pauncefote
treaty that Clayton-Bulwer rock on which Evarts, Blaine, and Frelinghuysen in turn had tried
dynamite in vain, were deeds seldom matched in statecraft.

By an act of Congress, in 1903, a new member was added to the President's cabinet in the person
of the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor. George B. Cortelyou was the first
man appointed to that office. Two bureaus, those of corporations and of manufactures, were
created for the department. The other bureaus, such as the Bureau of Statistics, Bureau of
Standards of Weights and Measures and Coast and Geodetic Survey, were transferred from the
other departments.

Among the problems engaging President Roosevelt none was of wider interest than the construction
of an Atlantic-Pacific canal. A commission of nine, Rear-Admiral Walker its head, had been
set by President McKinley to find the best route. It began investigation in the summer of 1899,
visiting Paris to examine the claims of the French Panama Company, and also Nicaragua and Panama.
It surveyed, platted, took borings, and made a minute and valuable report upon the work which
each of the proposed canals would require.

Parsons. 3. Wm. H. Burr. 4. C. E. Grunsky. 5. Ad. J. G. Walker. 6. B. M. Harrod. 7. Gen. Geo.
W. Davis.

The most practicable routes were Nicaragua and Panama. The Nicaragua way was between three
and four times the longer--183 miles to 49; 38 hours from ocean to ocean as against 12. The
Panama way was straighter, had less elevation at its summit, and required fewer locks. Congress
finally decided to construct a high level lock-canal. The cost of keeping up and operating
a Panama canal was estimated at six-tenths that of one across Nicaragua. Harbor expenses and
facilities would be nearly the same for both lines. The time required for construction, probably
nine or ten years, would be a trifle the less at Nicaragua. Control works, to keep always the
proper depth of water in the canal, could be more easily maintained at Panama.

Panama political and commercial complications were serious. The isthmus was Colombia territory,
and, since October, 1899, a civil war had been raging in that republic. Its financial condition
was desperate. Two hundred million inconvertible paper pesos had depreciated to the value of
two cents each in gold, yet were legal tender for all obligations. In such a country, especially
as war was in progress, the only government able to maintain itself was despotic. Civil troubles
were intensified by dissension between Catholics and Protestants. Revolution accompanied any
change in administration.

Under Ferdinand de Lesseps, creator of the Suez Canal, the French company had performed extensive
excavations at Panama. The New Panama Canal Company of France held certain concessions from
the Colombian government. The value of its assets was $109,000,000 at most. If we dug at Nicaragua
these would be worth little. Besides, a Nicaragua canal completed, some $6,000,000 of stock
owned by the French company in the Panama railroad would dwindle in value.

The validity of the French company's rights was questioned. Its agreement to work some each
year had not been kept. Its charter was to expire in October, 1904, but, for 5,000,000 francs,
the Colombia President granted a six-year extension. Even with this the French franchise would
revert to Colombia in 1910. Colombia wished delay. The United States transcontinental railroads
did not want a canal, as it would divert from them heavy, bulky, and imperishable freight.
They therefore joined Colombia in seeking delay, playing off the Nicaragua plan against the
Panama, hoping to defeat both.

Late in 1901, newspapers in the United States began urging the purchase from Colombia of a
land belt across the isthmus to be United States territory. Our Senate, December 16, 1901,
by a vote of 72 to 6, ratified the Hay-Pauncefote treaty with Great Britain, in which it was
agreed that we should build a canal, allowing all other nations to use it. Meantime, spite
of the fact that the Walker commission had recommended Nicaragua route, public sentiment began
to favor Panama. Even the Walker commission changed to this view.

The Spooner act of Congress, approved June 28, 1902, authorized the President to build an isthmian
canal. The Panama properties and franchises were to be bought if he could get good title and
also obtain the fee of a right of way from Colombia; otherwise he must pierce Nicaragua. The
act provided for all necessary funds. The French company's claims were investigated, pronounced
valid, and in due time acquired by the United States.

by the Isthmian Canal Commission. Dashed Lines--Routes investigated by others.

Effort to secure from Colombia the required territorial rights was made in the proposed Hay-Herran
treaty, ratified by our Senate, 73 against 5, March 17, 1903, under which we were to pay Colombia,
besides an annual rental $10,000,000 for the lease of a belt six miles wide from sea to sea.
August 17, 1903, the Colombian Senate rejected this treaty, and, October 18, the government
of that country proposed another, involving the payment by us of $25,000,000 instead of $10,000,000.
If we offered this, would not the price rise to $30,000,000 or more?

Papers in the United States argued for a revolution in Panama. The isthmus, it was urged, was
in time nearer to Washington than to Bogota. All Panama interests centred in the canal. Should
Nicaragua get the canal, Colon and Panama would be deserted. Both places owed their peace to
the presence of our navy. On the principle that treaties concerning territory run with the
territory, ignoring changes of sovereignty, our time-honored obligation to keep peace on the
isthmus, bound us, if Panama set up for herself, to protect her even against Colombia. England
would concur. English ships would use the canal more than ours. Great Britain, risking and
spending nothing, would gain incalculably. France, too, would acquiesce. The Frenchmen got
some $40,000,000 if the canal crossed Panama but lost everything if it passed to Nicaragua.
Other European nations wished the canal built and felt that now was the accepted time. Latin-American
States alone showed sympathy with Colombia.

Revolution took place. On the afternoon of November 3, 1903, the Panama city council declared
that city independent of Colombia. Colon followed. A provisional Panama government was organized.
November 6 we recognized Panama as an independent State. November 7 she appointed M. Bunau-Varilla
her diplomatic agent at Washington. November 13 he was, as such, formally received by President
Roosevelt. November 18 Secretary Hay and M. Bunau-Varilla signed a treaty whose first article
read: "The United States guarantees and will maintain the independence of the Republic of Panama."
Articles II and III gave us, in effect, sovereignty over a ten-mile wide canal zone between
the oceans. This treaty was ratified by Panama December 2, and by our Senate February 23, 1904.
November 16, 1903, Colombia protested to Great Britain against our action, and, November 28,
offered us a canal concession free if we would permit her to subjugate Panama.

Both at home and abroad the administration was charged with sharp practice for its Panama coup,
and the case made out by critics was prima facie strong--less, indeed, on its legal than on
its ethical and prudential side. We had allowed ourselves to profit by Colombia's distress,
encouraged secession in federal republics like our own, and rendered ourselves and our Monroe
doctrine objects of dread throughout Central and South America. Still, Colombia had been so
stiff and greedy and the settlement was in the main so happy, that censure soon subsided. All
the powerful nations speedily followed our example and recognized Panama's independence.

Copyright, 1900. by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y: Great heaps of wreckage piled high by the
Galveston disaster.

In September, 1900, the city of Galveston was visited by one of the greatest disasters known
in American history. A fierce storm swept the waters of the gulf over the island on which Galveston
is situated, destroying property aggregating many millions of dollars and causing the loss
of 6,000 lives out of the total population of 37,000. For a time it seemed that the site of
the city would have to be abandoned, for the highest land on which buildings stood was but
a few feet above the highest waves. It was determined, however, to build a stone wall three
miles in length which should be massive enough to protect the city from any similar attack.
Its top, which is five feet thick, is three feet above the highest point reached by the water.
The bottom of the wall is sixteen feet thick. This wall, which is built concave toward the
gulf, is protected by earth and stone filled in for two hundred feet, thus providing a driveway
thirty feet wide with walks on either side, beautified with trees and shrubs.

The management of public affairs during the rebuilding of the city was entrusted to a committee
of experts. So efficiently and economically was the administration of the government, that
the Galveston Plan, commonly spoken of as the Commission Plan, soon became a model for municipal
organization. A modification of this plan was soon put into operation at Des Moines, Iowa.
This plan consists of government by five salaried persons, one of them acting as mayor. This
body performs both legislative and executive duties, each member being in charge of a department
of the city government. The arguments in favor of this type of government are: (1) Responsibility
is easily located; (2) a few men receive such salaries that they may be expected to give their
whole time to the duties of their offices; (3) more civic interest will be aroused. All officers
are subject to removal at any time by vote of a certain proportion of the people.

The Cuban government was organized in the spring of 1902. On May 20 of that year, Governor-General
Wood for the United States turned over the government house at Havana to President Tomaso Estrada
y Palma.

The ceremonies attending the transfer were impressive. A letter from President Roosevelt addressed
to the President and the Congress of the Republic of Cuba was handed to President Palma. This
declared the occupation of Cuba by the United States to be at an end and tendered the sincere
friendship and good wishes of this country. At noon General Wood hauled down the American flag,
which had floated above the Governor's palace at Havana, and assisted General Gomez in raising
to the breeze the red triangle with central silver star and three blue and two white stripes
constituting the flag of the new republic. All of the foreign ships in the harbor likewise
ran up the Cuban flag in honor of the occasion. Forty-five shots, one for each State in the
Union, were fired as the stars and stripes were lowered from Morro Castle and the other fortresses.
The American troops saluted the new emblem, fired twenty-one guns in honor of the new nation,
and then embarked for the United States. Thus was kept to the letter--a noble example of public
faith--the promise we made when invading Cuba, that we would not acquire territory.

Those who prophesied a short life for the new republic and a reign of fraud and corruption
were mistaken. During the first year economy became the rule in the administration of all branches
of the public service, the government was self supporting, and a balance accumulated in the
treasury. Moreover, the reforms inaugurated by Americans continued. Some 3,400 teachers were
employed in the island and 120,000 pupils were in constant attendance upon the schools. In
all parts of the island the effects of American rule were visible. Ten million dollars had
been expended in sanitation reforms and the cleansing of Havana and the other cities. Industrial
schools for orphan boys and girls were begun and hospitals and asylums for the sick, helpless,
and insane were reestablished. By 1901 a railroad, with branch lines, was constructed between
Santiago and Havana, thus giving the whole island excellent transportation facilities.

Cuba could not gain prosperity at a bound. Whereas the island should, under natural conditions,
have had $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 due her from foreign countries in 1902, she was $50,000,000
in debt. Her manufactures were insignificant. It was estimated that, in the year named, $80,000,000
of American money was invested in Cuba. The main enterprises were railroads, sugar and tobacco
plantations, mines, and fruit farms.

Free commercial intercourse with Spain no longer existing, Cuban sugar and tobacco producers
sought markets in the United States, leading to the "reciprocity" conflict touched upon in
Chapter XIII, Vol. V. During 1902 a reciprocity treaty was negotiated and promptly ratified
in Cuba. Our Senate amended it and returned it to Cuba for reconsideration. Brought hither
again, it was passed by our Senate in December, 1903. President Roosevelt signed it December
17, declaring its provisions effective in ten days.

The Philippine Commission (Chapter XV, Vol. V), four Americans and three islanders, at first
enacted laws by the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief. After the Congressional
Act of July 1, 1902, the formula ran: "By authority of the United States be it enacted by the
Philippine Commission." The government was pronouncedly civil both in nature and in spirit,
the natives being gradually placated, and only an occasional outbreak demanding the presence
of troops. Schools were established, the English language and American ideas of government
and business introduced. No promise of Philippine independence was given, yet the tenor of
our whole policy toward the Filipinos, of official utterances and of public sentiment relating
to them, was to the effect that we should never look upon any of the islands as a crown colony.

Gov. William H. Taft [Secretary of War, 1905.]

The same interests that forbade Cuban reciprocity opposed tariff concessions to the Philippines.
A 25 per cent reduction from the Dingley rates was the best that Congress would grant, though
the commission besought one of at least 75 per cent. For a time our behavior in this too much
resembled English and Spanish dealings with colonies centuries ago. The United States acquired
from the Philippine religious orders 422,337 acres of land, three-fifths of it highly cultivated
and thickly inhabited, for $7,239,000. In all, the government owned about 61,000,000 out of
the perhaps 70,000,000 acres of land in the islands. Of the government lands, 40,000,000 acres
were forest.

The law of July 1, 1902, to supplement the commission, provided for a native assembly of not
more than 100 members or less than 50, with annual sessions of 90 days. Municipal autonomy
was allowed and became common. An efficient constabulary was established, also a Philippine
mint and coinage system on a gold basis. Careful exploitation of the agricultural, mineral,
and other resources of the islands was provided for, as well as an increasing number of public
improvements in the interest of order, health, and cleanliness. To promote investment in the
Philippine public works, 4 per cent bonds were issued, guaranteed by the United States.

[1904]

Preparatory to forming the Philippine Assembly the commission took a census of the islands.
In 1905 the population returned from 342 islands was 7,635,426. Of this number only about 9
per cent were wild tribes, though more than half the entire population could neither read nor
write in any language. Of the 370,000 pupils in the newly established schools, or double the
number in attendance two years previously, one in nine on the average had some understanding
of English. Twelve thousand adults were in the night schools, chiefly engaged in acquiring
the English language.

In February, 1904, a fire broke out in the heart of the city of Baltimore. Some 1,337 structures
were either entirely destroyed or rendered unfit for occupancy. The loss in buildings and other
property destroyed was about $75,000,000. With a few exceptions, the financial district of
the city was burned. For a time it was feared that the losses would be so great that restoration
could not be made, but new plans were projected which included broader streets and better buildings.
Instead of a decrease in the number of business concerns, there was an increase through the
entrance of firms from the outside.

The Varied Industries Building. THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION.

The Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis was opened April 30, 1904, and continued for
seven months. It commemorated the acquisition of the Louisiana territory which was consummated
April 30, 1803, marking one of the greatest events in American history. Out of this area had
been carved thirteen States and two territories wherein over 17,000,000 people were making
their homes.

The design for the exposition represented the work of ten of the most distinguished architects
of the country. The buildings, grouped in perfect taste, mostly of noble style, had 128 acres
of floor space, far beyond that at the disposal of any preceding fair. The grounds also were
unprecedentedly ample and beautifully diversified, containing about 1,200 acres. The total
attendance, 18,741,073, fell short of that at Chicago in 1893 by over 8,000,000.

The general plan of the exposition was intended to symbolize the history of the Louisiana territory
representing the successive occupants of the soil--the wild animals; the  Indians; the discoverers;
the explorers; the hunters; the trappers, and the pioneers. The aim was to make it one vast
educational object lesson. To that end there were extensive exhibits from thirty States and
from the chief cities of work done in the primary and secondary schools and in the universities
and colleges of the country. This feature culminated in the International Congress of Arts
and Sciences. Over 100 of the leading scholars from England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy,
Japan, the United States, and a number of other countries made addresses and took part in the
various discussions. All the fields of human knowledge were represented by these specialists.

One feature of this exposition was unique: it represented to an unprecedented extent processes
in lieu of products or in addition to them. Every day at almost every point something was literally
doing, going on. Machinery whizzed, mines were operated, artists were at work, experts showed
their craft; Indians, Filipinos, the blind, deaf, and dumb were taught.

CHAPTER III

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1904

[1904]

The Republican convention met at Chicago, June 21, and on June 23 nominated Theodore Roosevelt
for President. President Roosevelt's nomination was a certainty from the beginning. This action
was demanded by the rank and file of Republicans, for his achievements were popular. Among
the problems which he had helped to solve were those growing out of the war with Spain; settlement
of the anthracite coal strike; creation of the Department of Commerce and Labor; and the investigation
and prosecution of dishonesty in the post-office department.

Charles W. Fairbanks, Vice-President of the United States.

Plans for the convention had all been matured in advance with the exception of the selection
of a candidate for Vice-President. By the time the convention assembled the opinion was general
that for geographical reasons some one from Indiana should be named for this office. Charles
Warren Fairbanks, a leading lawyer in Indianapolis, who was serving his second term in the
United States Senate, was nominated without any real opposition. He had served as a member
of the Joint High Commission to adjust international questions of moment between the United
States and Great Britain. Grover Cleveland and William Jennings Bryan had declared they would
not be candidates for the presidency and the Democratic party was in a dilemma. Both the conservative
and the radical elements of the party declared they would write the platform and name the candidates.
Alton Brooks Parker, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of New York, who was supported by
Grover Cleveland, came gradually into prominence as the candidate of the conservatives and
William Randolph Hearst of the radicals.

The Republican convention at Chicago, 1904.

The chief contest came in the Democratic convention of New York. There Judge Parker was supported
by David B. Hill, ex-United States senator, and August Belmont, a New York banker. In consequence
it was declared by the opposition that Judge Parker was the candidate of the trusts, Wall Street
magnates, and a class of politicians of which Hill was the type. This view was taken by Bryan.
In spite of the opposition of Tammany leaders and the Hearst faction, twice as many Parker
as Hearst delegates were chosen.

William R. Hearst.

In the convention, which met at St. Louis, July 9, Judge Parker received 658 votes for President
on the first ballot, Hearst received 200, and there were a few scattering votes. The requisite
two-thirds came to Parker before the result of the ballot was announced. Henry G. Davis, of
West Virginia, was named for the office of Vice-President.

He had served two terms in the United States Senate, had declined the office of Post-Master
General under President Cleveland, was very wealthy, and noted for his philanthropy.

Bryan demanded that the platform should be silent on the question of the money standard, but
Parker declined the nomination unless it should be understood that he would maintain the gold
standard, and his declaration was endorsed by the convention.

There were no distinguishing issues between the two leading parties. The money question had
disappeared and both parties were outspoken in their declarations against trusts and combinations
of capital.

The Populist party, in a convention made up of delegates from one-half the States, nominated
Thomas E. Watson, of Georgia, and Thomas H. Tubbles, of Nebraska, for President and Vice-President,
respectively. There were two Socialist conventions: one, that of the Social Democratic party,
nominated Eugene V. Debs, of Indiana, for President, and the Socialist Labor party named Charles
H. Corregan, of New York, for the same office. The nominees of the Prohibitionist party were
Silas C. Swallow, of Pennsylvania, for President, and George W. Carroll, of Texas, for Vice-President.

The Democratic convention at St. Louis, 1904.

The campaign was noteworthy on account of the apathy which was very general. Heated discussions
so characteristic of previous political contests were seldom heard, and arguments were addressed
to the intelligence of voters rather than to passion and prejudice.

It has been called a reading rather than a speaking campaign. The leading Republican document
was a pamphlet containing two notable addresses. One of these was delivered by John Hay at
Jackson, Mich., on the occasion of the celebration of the semi-centennial of the founding of
the Republican party. He attributed to that party the success in the conduct of public affairs
since 1860, and praised President Roosevelt as a man and great administrator. The other speech
was similar in content, and was delivered by Elihu Root as temporary chairman of the Republican
convention.

Alton B. Parker.

Toward the close of the campaign, the charge was made that the Republicans were endeavoring
to win through a wholesale purchase of votes. It was asserted that George B. Cortelyou, manager
of the campaign, having obtained secrets of the conduct of some of the great corporations,
was using that knowledge to force them to contribute to the Republican fund. A second charge
proclaimed that the administration had changed its attitude toward certain corporations and
that the magnates of Wall Street, having decided to elect Roosevelt, were contributing generously
to the Republican campaign fund. Shortly before the day for the election, Judge Parker in a
series of speeches announced his belief in these reports. President Roosevelt declared that
no proof for the statements could be produced, and ended as follows: "The statements made by
Mr. Parker are unqualifiedly and atrociously false. As Mr. Cortelyou has said to me more than
once during this campaign, if elected I shall go into the presidency unhampered by any pledge,
promise, or understanding of any kind, sort or description, save my promise, made openly to
the American people, that so far as in my power lies I shall see to it that every man has a
square deal, no less and no more." In his reply, Judge Parker reiterated the charge, but gave
no concrete instances of money having been obtained from corporations.

Out of a total vote of 13,544,705, Roosevelt received 7,630,893 votes, or 2,524,244 more than
his leading competitor. His majority was 1,717,081. Debs received 397,308 votes; Swallow, 258,039;
Watson, 114,306; Corregan, 32,516. Thirty-three States gave Roosevelt majorities and twelve
Southern States returned majorities for Parker. In the electoral college Roosevelt received
336 votes and Parker 140. A surprising feature of the election was the large number of independent
votes cast, as shown by the fact that Minnesota, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Montana, while
giving majorities for the Republican candidates, elected Democratic governors, and in several
other States a similar tendency was manifest in the divergence between the vote for the national
candidates and local candidates.

CHAPTER IV

AMERICA AND THE CHINESE OPEN DOOR

[1905]

The aggressive policy of President Roosevelt continued throughout the four years succeeding
March 4, 1905, when he again took the oath of office as President. In his suggested reforms
he continued to be a real leader of the people. John Hay, who for seven years had so efficiently
performed his duties as Secretary of State, was continued in that office. William H. Taft,
after his return from the Philippine Islands, where he had held the office of first civil governor,
succeeded Elihu Root as Secretary of War.

The United States, having become a world power after the war with Spain, assumed leadership
in the adjustment of Chinese problems. At the close of the century American manufacturers had
built up in China a market for their cotton goods which they desired to extend. At the same
time strife arose among some of the European nations for trade advantages in that empire. Great
Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Italy were demanding for their citizens concessions,
leases, franchises, and special trade privileges in various parts of that country. Gradually,
spheres of influence covering certain regions were acquired and it seemed probable that China
would be partitioned among the European Powers as Africa had been in the previous decade. This
would be a blow to American export trade. Now the acquisition of the Philippine Islands gave
us a vantage point from which we could consistently exert influence in Oriental affairs. In
September, 1899, John Hay addressed a note to the European Powers interested, asking recognition
of the policy of the "open door," which means that no power should exclude the citizens of
other nations from equal trade rights, within its sphere of influence, in China. Without winning
complete acceptance from all the nations, the justice of this policy was, in the main, approved.

During the following year came the Boxer Rebellion in which there were massacres of Europeans
and Americans. When the foreign legations were besieged in Peking, United States troops took
part in the expedition which marched to their relief. Seizure of Chinese territory, as indemnity,
might have followed, but Secretary Hay brought the influence of this country to bear in securing
guarantees of the territorial integrity of China and equal trade rights in its ports.

Friendly relations between the Chinese Empire and the United States were still further strengthened
by the liberal attitude of our government relative to the indemnity growing out of the Boxer
uprising. The total amount which China had obligated itself to pay the governments, societies,
and private individuals was $333,000,000. Of this sum, $24,400,778 was allotted to the United
States. As a mark of friendship for China, Congress upon the recommendation of President Roosevelt,
1907, cancelled the obligation of China to pay that part of the stipulated indemnity in excess
of $11,655,492, or an amount adequate to cover the actual amount of the claims. This generous
conduct prompted the Chinese government to devote the funds thus remitted to the sending of
Chinese students to this country for their education. About one hundred of these students have
entered our schools and colleges each year since 1907. American institutions will, as a consequence,
have a great influence on the progressive development of China.

For some time Russia had been extending her influence over the Chinese tributary province of
Manchuria. In 1903 negotiations for a new commercial treaty were begun between China and the
United States. There were numerous delays on account of an agreement relative to opening the
Manchurian ports. For a time it seemed probable that the American demand that her trading rights
should be restored in Manchuria would bring on serious complications with Russia. Upon the
completion of the treaty, however, the request was renewed and China acquiesced by opening
the ports of Mukden and Ta Tung Kao to the ships of all nations. At the same time Russia agreed
that she would in no way oppose this action.

At the outbreak of the war between Japan and Russia, in 1904, Secretary Hay took another step
toward maintaining the administrative entity of the Chinese Empire. At the suggestion of Germany
he addressed a note to the powers which had taken part in the treaty of Peking, asking them
to pledge themselves to limit the area of the war; keep China from becoming involved, and use
their best endeavors to prevent the violation of Chinese interests by either belligerent, provided
China should maintain absolute neutrality. These proposals were agreed to by the signatory
nations, and both Russia and Japan promised to respect Chinese neutrality.

Meantime a new national spirit had been developing rapidly in China and a greater sensitiveness
was manifest toward the treatment of Chinese outside the empire. The strict interpretation
of the Chinese Exclusion act had caused many Chinese entering the ports of the United States
unwarranted hardships. A crisis was reached in 1905.

Arrival of Chinamen at Malone, N. Y., from Canada, accompanied by officials.

According to the rules adopted by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, neither the immigration
acts nor the Chinese exclusion acts apply to a Chinese person born in the United States. Under
the laws, all Chinese laborers, both skilled and unskilled, are prohibited from entering the
United States, but this prohibition does not extend to merchants, teachers, students, and travellers
who are to be granted all the rights, privileges, and exemptions accorded the citizens of any
other nation. In spite of these rulings, Ju Toy, who claimed to have been born in the United
States, was deported. Three Chinamen, with their sister, who had been studying in the English
schools came to Boston. Notwithstanding they had a letter from Mr. Choate, former United States
ambassador to Great Britain, they were not allowed to land with other passengers, and were
otherwise humiliated by the formalities to which they were subjected. Men of influence throughout
the Chinese Empire were aroused and a circular was issued, in May, 1905, which was widely disseminated
in the chief cities, calling for agreement not to buy any more American goods. Newspapers urged
students to leave schools where American teachers were employed or American text-books or supplies
were used. At this juncture President Roosevelt was appealed to by the American members of
the Chinese Educational Association. Acting with his accustomed vigor, he issued instructions
to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to send a letter to all immigration officials, instructing
them that "any discourtesy shown to Chinese persons by any officials of the Government will
be the cause for immediate dismissal from the service." In his message to Congress he declared
that it was Chinese laborers alone who are undesirable, and that other Chinamen--students,
professional men, merchants--should be encouraged to come to the United States. "We have no
right," he wrote, "to claim the open door in China unless we do equity to the Chinese."

CHAPTER V

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION

[1903-1905]

Great progress was made during the nineteenth century toward the settlement of differences
between nations through arbitration. The United States was a party to 50 out of the total number
of 120 arbitration treaties. Questions settled in this manner, such as boundary, damages inflicted
by war or civil disturbances and injuries to commerce, would formerly have led to war. Twenty
of these cases have been between the United States and Great Britain, and a settlement was
effected when, at times, it seemed as if war could not be averted.

The work of the Hague Peace Conference, which met May 18, 1899, constituted a fitting close
to the efforts which were put forth during the century to bring about conciliation through
arbitration. The conference assembled in response to an invitation issued by the Czar of Russia
"on behalf of disarmament and the permanent peace of the world." One hundred and ten delegates
were present, representing twenty-six different powers of which the United States was one.
The delegates were divided into three commissions, each having separate subjects for consideration.

The House in the Woods, The Hague, Holland, where the first Peace Conference was held.

The first commission adopted unanimously the resolution that "the limitation of the military
charges which so oppress the world is greatly to be desired," but agreed that this  could not
now be accomplished through an international compact.

In the second commission a revision of the Declaration of Brussels concerning the rules of
war was made. It was agreed by the entire conference that a new convention for this purpose
should be called, and that the protection offered by the Red Cross, as agreed upon in the Geneva
convention, should also be extended to naval warfare.

The proposition expressing the desire that international conflicts might in the future be settled
through arbitration was considered by the third commission. Said ex-President Harrison: "The
greatest achievement of the Hague conference was the establishment of an absolutely impartial
judicial tribunal." Some of the chief features of this permanent court of arbitration were
as follows: (1) Each nation which agreed to the plan was to appoint, within three months, four
persons of recognized competency in international law, who were to serve for six years as members
of the International Court; (2) an International Bureau was established at The Hague for the
purpose of carrying on all intercourse between the signatory powers relative to the meetings
of the court and to serve also as the recording office, for the court; (3) nations in dispute
may select from the list of names appointed as above, and submitted to them by the bureau,
those persons whom they desire to act as arbitrators; (4) the meetings of the court are to
be held at The Hague unless some other place is stipulated by the nations in the controversy.

The permanent International Court of Arbitration was declared to be organized and ready for
operation by April, 1901. At that time there were seventy-two judges appointed by twenty-two
of the signatory powers, It is readily seen that the advantages of such a court are that unprejudiced
arbitrators are selected, rules of procedure are defined, and decisions rendered are more liable
to be accepted in future cases and thus a code of law will be formed, So many cases have been
submitted to this tribunal that it has been said that a government which will not now try arbitration
before resorting to arms is no longer considered respectable. This court was convened for the
first time May 18, 1901.

The first case coming before the tribunal--the Pious Fund Case--was presented by the United
States and Mexico, September 15, 1902. Up to 1846 the Mexican government had paid annual interest
on some property administered by it but belonging to the Catholic church. Part of it was situated
in what is now California. After 1848, when this California estate came under United States
jurisdiction, Mexico refused to pay that part of the church outside of Mexico its share. This
difference between our Government and Mexico the Hague Tribunal took up.

Agreeably to chapter 3, title 4, of the agreement, each party named two arbitrators, and the
latter, acting together, an umpire. In case of an equality of votes a third power, designated
by agreement of the parties, was to select the umpire. The arbitrators chosen were M. de Martens,
of the Orthodox Greek church; Sir Edward Fry, an English Protestant; M. Asser, a Jew, and M.
Savornin-Loman, a Dutch Protestant. Decision was reached within the prescribed thirty days
and announced October 14, 1902. It favored the United States contention, giving its proportion
of the Mexican payments to the Catholic church in California.

President Castro of Venezuela.

A second case, involving issues of war and peace, arose from the action of Great Britain and
Germany against Venezuela in the winter of 1902-1903. Subjects of these as well as of  other
powers had claims against Venezuela. That country was in financial straits and its creditors
pressed. December 9, 1902, British and German war-ships sunk or seized some Venezuelan vessels;
next day they landed marines at La Guayra, who took possession of the custom house; the 14th
they bombarded and demolished a fort at Puerto Cabello. Through the good offices of the United
States the matter of debts was referred to the Hague Tribunal. The German claims were decided
by two representatives of Germany and two of Venezuela, or, if they disagreed, by an umpire
whom the United States selected. So with the other claims. The tribunal fixed the order in
which Venezuela should pay the different countries, and the United States was charged with
overseeing the payments, a percentage of Venezuelan customs receipts being reserved for that
purpose.

In 1903 Andrew Carnegie donated $1,500,000 for the purpose of erecting a "palace of peace,"
the permanent head-quarters of this court. The deed of trust states: "The establishment of
a permanent Court of Arbitration by the treaty of the 29th of July, 1899, is the most important
step forward, of a world-wide humanitarian character, that has ever been taken by the joint
powers, as it must ultimately banish war, and further, being of opinion that the cause of peace
will greatly benefit by the erection of a court house and library for the permanent Court of
Arbitration," etc.

The new Peace Palace, The Hague, Holland.

The site of this building, which will be ready for occupancy in 1912, is near The Hague. Its
exterior will resemble some of the old city walls to be seen in Holland. The various governments
which were parties to the treaty have contributed materials for the completion of the interior
and objects of art for decoration. The United States presented a large marble group of statuary
called "Peace Through Justice."

Two notable congresses were held in the United States during the year 1904, for the purpose
of promoting the peace of the world. The Inter-Parliamentary Union held a meeting, the twelfth
in its history, in connection with the World's Fair at St. Louis. This organization was founded
at Paris in 1888 by thirty members of the French Chamber of Deputies and ten members of the
British Parliament, for the purpose of promoting the cause of peace and arbitration. Scoffed
at from the beginning, the Union continued to grow until it included parliamentary delegates
from every European country having a constitutional form of government.

The meeting of the Union at St. Louis was the first to be held in the United States, for this
country took no part in the organization until 1903. Russia and Turkey, having no parliaments,
are not represented in the meetings of the Union. It is a noteworthy fact however that the
Czar sent an official representative to the meeting in 1896 and that it was due to his report
of that meeting, more than to any other cause, that the Czar invited the nations to send representatives
to The Hague in 1898.

Russian and Japanese Peace Envoys in session at Portsmouth, N. H.

In the congress at St. Louis, representatives from the deliberative bodies of fifteen nations
were present. Among these delegates were some of the well-known public men from Great Britain,
France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, the United States, and various other
countries. They were practical men and not dreamers.

Two important resolutions resulted from the gathering. One of these called upon the powers
to intervene and put an end to the war between Russia and Japan. The other invited the President
of the United States to call a second peace congress, similar to the Hague conference. The
resolution, addressed to President Roosevelt, stated that there were a number of questions
left unsettled from the first Hague conference and that new problems had arisen since that
time which demanded readjustment, such as the use of wireless telegraphy in the time of war.

On October 3 of the same year an international peace congress was held in Boston. Numerous
congresses of this nature have been held from time to time since the meeting of the first one
in London in 1843. Since the year 1888, when a congress was held in Paris, an international
peace congress has met each year with the exception of 1895, the year of the Boer war, and
in 1898 and 1899, on account of the Spanish-American war. The first of these congresses in
America was held in conjunction with the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, 1893. There were
in attendance at Boston distinguished statesmen, clergymen, scholars, and professional men,
and a number of noted women, representing the many peace and arbitration societies in Great
Britain, Germany, Austria, and numerous other countries.

On the Sunday before the opening of the congress, special services were held in many of the
Boston churches and the peace movement was discussed by distinguished preachers from Europe
and America. In the deliberative sessions, which were held in Faneuil Hall, the Old South Meeting
House, and other places, the first session being opened by an address by Secretary of State
John Hay, the following topics, among others, were discussed: the work and influence of the
Hague Tribunal; the reduction of the armaments of the nations; education and the peace sentiment.
But here, as in every previous congress, the two topics to receive primary consideration have
been arbitration and disarmament. At all times there has been the urgent appeal to the nations
to abandon the brutality and injustice of war and to adopt the humane and just methods of peace.

In response to the resolution adopted at St. Louis, President Roosevelt, on October 20, 1904,
invited the nations which had taken part in the first Hague conference to another conference
at the same place. But in his message to Congress of that year he defined very clearly his
own position, condemning in no uncertain terms the thought of peace at any price.

Building where the second Peace Conference was held, The Hague, Holland.

Favorable replies to the invitation sent by President Roosevelt were received from all the
nations. Russia, then in the midst of war with Japan, while approving, stipulated that the
conference should not be called until the end of that war. When peace was restored, in the
summer of 1905, Emperor Nicholas II issued an invitation to fifty-three nations to send representatives
to such a conference. For the first time, nearly every independent nation on the globe was
represented among the delegates in an international gathering of this nature. It met at The
Hague during the summer of 1907.

First session of the second Peace Conference, The Hague, Holland.

Delegates from the United States were instructed to favor obligatory arbitration; the establishment
of a permanent court of arbitration; the prohibition of force in the collection of contract
debts; immunity from seizure of private property at sea; a clearer definition of the rights
of neutrals, and the limitation of armaments.

While belief was reasserted by the conference that there should be the obligatory arbitration
of all questions relating to treaties and international problems of a legal nature, the principle
was not adopted, although thirty-two nations of the forty-five represented favored it.

Provision was made for an international prize court, to which appeal might be made from the
prize courts of the belligerent powers. The declaration was adopted prohibiting the throwing
of projectiles and explosives from balloons.

Before the end of the year 1908, one hundred and thirty-five arbitration treaties had been
concluded. The United States was a party to twelve of these. Most of the treaties bind the
signatory powers to submit to the Hague Tribunal all differences in so far as they do not affect
"the independence, the honor, the vital interests, or the exercise of sovereignty of the contracting
countries, and provided it has been impossible to obtain an amicable solution by means of direct
diplomatic negotiations or by any other method of conciliation."

CHAPTER VI

THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA

[1905-1906]

Looking toward the completion of the Panama Canal, there has been a revival of interest on
the part of the United States in the republics of South America. From the time of the promulgation
of the Monroe Doctrine, there has been a distant friendship on our part for these nations.
The plan inaugurated by James G. Blaine when Secretary of State is much better understood to-day
than in his time. In 1881, with the desire of emphasizing the leadership of the United States
in the western hemisphere, he proposed a congress of all the American nations. Nothing came
of the proposal at the time, but in 1888 Congress passed a resolution providing for such an
international conference. The meeting was in Washington the following year, and Secretary Blaine,
as chairman, exercised great influence. While the direct results of the meeting were not great--principally
a declaration in favor of the arbitration of all disputes among these nations--the indirect
benefits were considerable.

In the meantime the trade with these countries has been largely monopolized by England, France,
and Germany. During the year 1905, the total exports and imports of the Latin-American countries
amounted to $2,000,000,000. Of this foreign trade the United States bought 35 per cent of the
exports and sold to these countries only 27 per cent of their imports, producing an unfavorable
balance of trade amounting to $200,000,000. Of the goods imported from this country, over one-fourth
went to Mexico and Cuba. In that year Brazil bought from the United States only 11 per cent
of its imports. Argentina, with a larger foreign trade than either Japan or China, bought only
14 per cent of its imports from the United States. With the exception of Mexico, the foreign
commerce of the Latin-American states with European countries has increased more rapidly than
with the United States. Various reasons have been given for this situation. The sensitive South
American resents the air of superiority assumed toward them by the people of the United States.
In our newspapers there is a seeming disregard for the real evidences of their national development.
Revolutions and boundary disputes have been exaggerated. In general, citizens of the United
States have no comprehension of the advancement of these countries within recent times and
appreciate but slightly that their economic future is as fully assured as our own. Argentina
constitutes an excellent example of this progress. This country has an area of 1,135,840 square
miles. Splendid rivers water the immense plains. The chief of these, the Parana, which flows
2,000 miles through the country, carries a volume of water to the sea one and one-half times
that of the Mississippi, and is capable of floating ships having a draught of 18 feet for 600
miles into the interior. Buenos Ayres, with a population of 1,000,000, in 1906 had a volume
of foreign trade amounting to $562,000,000, constituting it the twelfth port in the world.
In 1905 over 10,000,000 acres of land were cultivated in Argentina, an increase of fourfold
within fifteen years. The cereals, cotton, fruits, and meats produced amounted to $350,000,000.

That the volume of trade between this country and the South American states has been so small
has been due also to the fact that so few vessels flying the stars and stripes are engaged
in this trade. According to the report of Secretary Root, in 1906, there were in the harbor
of Rio Janeiro the previous year, 1,785 ships flying the flag of Great Britain; 657 the flag
of Germany; 349 the French; 142 the Norwegian, and 7 sailing vessels (two of them in distress)
the flag of the United States. The bulk of goods from this country to South America goes by
the way of European ports and on foreign ships.

July 4, 1906, the third Pan-American conference was opened at Rio Janeiro. Among the leading
questions discussed were: (1) the right of creditor nations to enforce by war on the debtor
nations contractual obligations, or the right to use gun-boats as collection agents; and (2)
those relating to commercial intercourse. Besides the regular delegates from the United States,
Elihu Root, Secretary of State, was present at the opening session. His address at this meeting,
together with his visit to the leading cities, served to inaugurate a new understanding between
these countries and the United States. The true American policy was set forth by Secretary
Root in the following toast: "May the independence, the freedom, and the rights of the least
and weakest be ever respected equally with the rights of the strongest, and may we all do our
share toward the building up of a sound and enlightened public opinion of the Americas which
shall everywhere, upon both continents, mightily promote the reign of peace, of order, and
of justice in every American republic." He went as Ambassador Extraordinary representing the
President of the United States. In order to emphasize his official position, he travelled on
an American war-ship. His addresses made in the various cities were intended to be an official
declaration from the government of the United States, and that position was outlined in his
formal address before the congress.

The International Bureau of American Republics was founded as a result of the first Pan-American
conference. The original plans of the founders were not carried out owing to a lack of interest
on the part of the Department of State as well as in the foreign offices of the South American
countries. Secretary Root determined to make this bureau an efficient agency for bringing about
better relations between the two continents. He defined the main purpose to be not only to
build up trade and commerce among all American nations, but to promote more friendly relations,
a better understanding of each other, and the general prosperity and well-being of all the
countries of the American continents. Through gifts from Andrew Carnegie and contributions
from the different South American states a splendid modern building, costing $1,000,000, was
erected in Washington, 1908, as the home of the Bureau of the Pan-American Republics. Besides
other enterprises, the Bureau publishes a monthly periodical which contains information on
the commerce, new enterprises, and general development of each republic.

With these new relationships came a new interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. At various times
European nations have engaged in controversies with South American states over the payment
of debts due the citizens of the former. The question has then arisen, to what extent shall
the United States permit the use of force against the debtor nations? The wider application
of the Monroe Doctrine under President Cleveland looking toward the maintenance of the rights
of the weaker American nations, has been followed by recognition of our obligation to secure
the performance of duties by those nations.

The immediate cause for this statement by President Roosevelt was the problem confronting our
government on account of the bankrupt condition of the Republic of Santo Domingo. Debts had
accumulated for over thirty years until by the beginning of 1905 they amounted to more than
$32,000,000. Each successive ruler became a more reckless borrower and new loans were secured
upon harsher terms.

Finally affairs were brought to a crisis on account of the pressure on the part of the French
and Italian governments for the payment of the claims of their citizens. The republic was on
the verge of dissolution when President Roosevelt intervened. European governments were satisfied,
for it signified the payment of their claims. An agreement was signed by representatives of
the government of Santo Domingo and of the United States whereby the United States was to undertake
the task of collecting and apportioning the revenues of Santo Domingo. The stipulation was
made that no plan of annexation, purchase, or permanent control on the part of the United States
should ensue. Agents were to be appointed by the United States who should take charge of the
customhouses. Forty-five per cent of the total receipts were to be used in carrying on the
affairs of the republic and the balance was to go to pay the indebtedness. In his message,
February, 1905, President Roosevelt, pressing upon the Senate the urgent need for the ratification
of this agreement, said: "The state of things in Santo Domingo has become hopeless unless the
United States or some other strong government shall interpose to bring order out of chaos.
. . . If the United States declines to take action and other foreign governments resort to
action to secure payment of their claims, the latter would be entitled, according to the decision
of the Hague Tribunal in the Venezuela cases, to the preferential payment of their claims;
and this would absorb all the Dominican revenues and would be a virtual sacrifice of American
claims and interests in the island. If, moreover, any such action should be taken by them,
the only method to enable the payment of their claims would be to take possession of the custom-houses,
and, considering the state of the Dominican finances, this would mean a definite and very possibly
permanent occupation of Dominican territory, for no period could be set to the time which would
be necessarily required for the payment of their obligations and unliquidated claims." The
Senate, in special session, shirked responsibility and refused either to ratify or reject the
treaty.

With the revolutionists on the island growing stronger and the European Powers becoming more
insistent, President Roosevelt, disregarding the attitude of the Senate, appointed an American
as receiver of customs. The move proved immediately successful. The insurrection died out,
trade revived, smuggling ceased, and the people were infused with a new spirit. There was also
a remarkable increase in the customs receipts, those of 1906 showing an increase of 44 per
cent over the receipts of 1905 and 72 per cent over those of 1904. Although only 45 per cent
of the revenues collected were turned over to the Dominican government, this sum was almost
double the amount which they had received when they had control of the collection themselves.

After two years of discussion, the treaty was ratified by the Senate, February 25, 1907, and
by the Dominican Congress, May 3. The terms were practically those which had been carried out
by order of President Roosevelt. The United States, in a sense, became the trustee of Santo
Domingo, and thus established a new relation between this country and the smaller republics
of the western hemisphere.

CHAPTER VII

CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES

[1906]

Toward the close of the nineteenth century, attention was called to the fact by scientific
men that the methods employed in the use of our soil, mines, forests, and water supply were
extremely wasteful. During the previous decades the resources of the country were regarded
as inexhaustible. As stated by President Roosevelt in 1907: "Hitherto as a nation we have tended
to live with an eye single to the present, and have permitted the reckless waste and destruction
of much of our national wealth." At the same time the call came for the conservation of our
natural resources.

The destruction of the forests first attracted attention. The first national reservation of
forests was made in 1891, and in 1898 a marked advance was made by the establishment of a division
of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. Gifford Pinchot, as chief of the division, called
attention of the people to the interdependence of the forests and the waterways.

In 1906, after long effort, the famous Mariposa Grove of large trees in California was made
a national reservation. During the same year a bill was passed by Congress providing for the
preservation of Niagara Falls. Public opinion had been aroused by the campaign of the American
Civic Association. Power companies had multiplied so rapidly that it seemed the whole volume
of water was about to be used for commercial purposes and that the most famous object of natural
scenery in the United States would be destroyed.

In response to appeals from the people of the interior, President Roosevelt, March 14, 1907,
appointed the Inland Waterways Commission. In his letter which created the commission he said:
"The time has come for merging local projects and uses of the inland waters in a comprehensive
plan designed for the benefit of the entire country. . . . I ask that the Inland Waterways
Commission shall consider the relations of the streams to the use of all the great permanent
natural resources and their conservation for the making and maintenance of prosperous homes."

This commission while carrying on its investigations discussed the general policy of conservation
and suggested to the President the calling of a convention for the purpose of discussing the
conservation of the nation's resources. Thus originated the celebrated White House conference
of May 13-15, 1908. The opening session presented an impressive scene, for there were assembled
in the east room of the White House, upon the invitation of the President, the Vice-President,
seven members of the cabinet, all of the justices of the Supreme Court, most of the representatives
and senators, thirty-four governors of States together with their advisers, and representatives
of the governors of the remaining States, governors of the Territories, representatives of
sixty-eight national societies, and numerous special guests.

The opening address of President Roosevelt was a notable effort. "This conference," he said,
"on the conservation of natural resources is in effect a meeting of the representatives of
all the people of the United States called to consider the weightiest problem now before the
nation. . . . We have become great in a material sense because of the lavish use of our resources,
and we have just reason to be proud of our growth. But the time has come to inquire seriously
what will happen when our forests are gone; when the coal, the iron, the oil, and the gas are
exhausted; when the soils shall have been still further impoverished and washed into the streams,
polluting the rivers, denuding the fields, and obstructing navigation. These questions do not
relate only to the next century or the next generation. One distinguishing characteristic of
really civilized men is foresight; we have to, as a nation, exercise foresight for this nation
in the future, and if we do not exercise that foresight, dark will be the future!"

During the meeting numerous addresses were made on the conservation of the minerals, of the
soils, of the forests, and of the waters of the country. In his address on the conservation
of ores and related minerals, Andrew Carnegie declared that during the three-fourths of a century
from 1820 to 1895 nearly 4,000,000,000 tons of coal were mined by methods so wasteful that
6,000,000,000 tons were either destroyed or allowed to remain in the ground forever inaccessible.
From 1896 to 1906 as much coal was produced as during the preceding seventy-five years. During
this decade 3,000,000,000 tons were destroyed or left in the ground beyond reach for future
use. Basing his statements on the investigations of scientists, he showed that at the present
rate of increase in production the available coal of the country would be exhausted in two
hundred years and the workable iron ore within a century.

Similarly, James J. Hill demonstrated that the forests of this country are fast disappearing
and that from three to four times as much timber was consumed each year as forest growth restored.
His statements regarding the tremendous soil waste in our farming methods were likewise astounding.
Resolutions were adopted covering the entire subject of conservation as shown in one of them
as follows: "We agree that the land should be so used that erosion and soil-wash shall cease;
that there should be reclamation of arid and semi-arid regions by means of irrigation, and
of swamps and overflowed regions by means of drainage; that the waters should be so conserved
and used as to promote navigation, to enable the arid regions to be reclaimed by irrigation,
and to develop power in the interests of the people; that the forests which regulate our rivers,
support our industries, and promote the fertility and productiveness of the soil should be
preserved and perpetuated; that the minerals found so abundantly beneath the surface should
be so used as to prolong their utility; that the beauty, healthfulness, and habitability of
our country should be preserved and increased; that the sources of national wealth exist for
the benefit of the people, and that monopoly thereof should not be tolerated." It was recommended
that the States should establish conservation commissions to co-operate with one another and
with a similar national commission.

On June 8, 1908, the first national conservation commission was created by President Roosevelt.
Its forty-nine members were men well known in politics, in the industries, and scientific work.
Gifford Pinchot was chairman of this commission which submitted its first report at a conference
in Washington, December 8-10, 1908. The delegates consisted of governors and other representatives
from the States and from national organizations. This report was received with favor and it
was recommended that the work of the commission should be continued. Congress declined to make
the necessary appropriation of $25,000 for this purpose, although it was strongly endorsed
by the President.

In 1901 the National Conservation Association was formed, a voluntary organization of public
and scientific men. The purpose of this association is to carry on the movement for conservation
in every State. Within seven months after the White House conference, forty-one State conservation
commissions were created and fifty-one conservation commissions representing national organizations
were formed.

President Roosevelt carried the movement still farther in calling the first North American
conservation congress. Representatives to this conference met in Washington, February 18, 1909.
They came from Canada, Newfoundland, and Mexico as well as the United States. Broad general
principles of conservation applicable to the North American continent were adopted.

Gifford Pinchot, President of the Conservation Commission.

The movement was materially strengthened also through the withdrawal of large areas of the
public domain from private entry. Thus 148,000,000 acres of forests and 80,000,000 acres of
coal land were withdrawn during President Roosevelt's administrations.

Directly connected with the problems of conservation are those of irrigation. The so-called
arid regions constitute two-fifths of the area of the United States, or some 1,200,000 square
miles. Of this vast region, it has been estimated that about one-tenth can be irrigated to
advantage. By the end of the year 1908, some 13,000,000 acres had been reclaimed, or nearly
one-third of the total amount suitable for irrigation purposes. This has brought about the
rapid growth of cities and a substantial industrial advance in the former arid regions of the
far West. The most notable impulse to this movement was made in 1902 when Congress passed a
law, the Reclamation act, providing that the proceeds from the sales of public lands in thirteen
States and three Territories should be expended by the National Government in the construction
of irrigation works.

The total receipts from the sales of these lands amounted to $28,000,000 by the end of the
year 1905, and twenty-three projects, dams, reservoirs, or canals were in different stages
of construction. The most important of these undertakings were the Roosevelt Dam, the Shoshone
Dam, and the Truckee-Carson Canal.

Built by the U. S. Reclamation Service. Roosevelt Dam from the road.

The Roosevelt Dam is the chief work of construction in what is called the Salt River project.
By the completion of this work at least 200,000 acres in the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona,
were reclaimed. This dam is 284 feet high, 1,080 feet long on the crest, and 165 feet thick
at the base. The resulting reservoir with a storage area of 16,320 acres will be the largest
artificially formed lake in the world.  It forms a body of water 25 miles long, almost 2 miles
broad, and with a maximum depth of 220 feet. The main canals are 119 miles in length and the
lateral canals 208 miles. Not only will this structure insure a supply of water in the Salt
River valley where, in recent years, orchards and other products have perished, but it will
prevent the floods which have devastated that region from time to time. Water-power amounting
to 25,000 horse-power has been developed by the construction. This power is used in part for
pumping, and another area, estimated at 40,000 acres, outside the territory covered by the
canals has been reclaimed. The power is also used for lighting, for manufacturing, and for mining.

It was seen that the Shoshone River, in northwestern Wyoming, during the season of melting
snows, carried away more waste water than would be adequate to reclaim many thousands of acres
in the arid regions of the lower altitudes. Two million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
were allotted for the construction of the Shoshone Dam which will form a reservoir of water
sufficient to irrigate 75,000 acres of land 50 miles farther down the river.

The Truckee-Carson project provides for the irrigation of 150,000 acres in western Nevada.
The water of the Truckee River, which flows out of Lake Tahoe, is distributed by canals having
an aggregate length of 670 miles. The main canal was opened in 1905.

By the close of the year 1906, over $39,000,000 had been allotted for works under actual construction,
and this amount had increased to $119,500,000 within four years. It has been estimated that
the land thus reclaimed will alone be worth $240,000,000. The additional cost of a project
is assessed against the land. When the land is sold, the money received is used for the development
of new irrigation areas.

Another significant plan outlined by the irrigation congress in its meeting, 1911, provided
for bringing about the complete reclamation of all swamp and overflowed land. The swampland
area of the United States exceeds 74,500,000 acres, or an amount greater than the area of the
Philippine Islands by 1,000,000 acres.

The Mississippi basin has been called the heart and soul of the prosperity of the United States.
Two-fifths of the area of the country, comprising one-half the population, is tributary to
the Mississippi system, which has over 20,000 miles of navigable waters. This valley produces
three-fourths of our foreign exports. The network of railroads covering this territory has
for a number of years furnished altogether inadequate transportation facilities, and conditions
have grown steadily worse. Traffic experts throughout the United States have been advising
river improvement as a means of relieving the congestion of freight. This situation has led
to a revival of interest in the deep waterway from the Lakes to the Gulf which has been talked
and written about for nearly three-quarters of a century.

Concerted action was not taken until 1907, when the Lakes to the Gulf Deep Waterways Association
was formed at St. Louis, having for its object the deepening of the water-way between Lake
Michigan and the Gulf. The proposal to construct a canal by the way of the Illinois River to
the Mississippi, large enough to carry ships, was declared feasible by government engineers
and a route was surveyed. President Roosevelt endorsed the scheme. In his message to Congress,
December 3, 1907, he said: "From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should
be a deep water-way, with deep water-ways leading from it to the East and the West.

He appointed an Inland Waterways Commission which was to outline a comprehensive scheme of
development along the various lines indicated. Their leading recommendation had to do with
the proposal for a deep water-way from Chicago to New Orleans. The completion of the drainage
canal by the city of Chicago, at a cost of $55,000,000, really created a deep waterway for
forty miles along the intended route. It was reported to Congress by a special board of surveyors
that the continuation of such a water-way to St. Louis would cost $31,000,000.

Inland Waterways Commission.

The legislature of Illinois, following the recommendation of Governor Charles S. Deneen, submitted
to the people an amendment of the constitution which would enable the State to assume a bonded
indebtedness of $20,000,000 for the purpose of constructing a deep waterway from Chicago to
St. Louis. The measure was approved by popular vote November 3, 1907. Thereupon, the State
Senate passed a bill providing for the construction of the canal. This failed in the House.
It was again introduced into the legislature, 1910, but failed to pass.

Among the other important projects submitted by the Inland Waterways Commission are the following:
To connect the Great Lakes with the ocean by a twenty-foot channel by the way of the Erie Canal
and the Hudson River, an inner channel extending from New England to Florida; to connect the
Columbia River with Puget Sound and deepen the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers, so as
to bring commerce by water to Sacramento and other interior California cities.

With the hope that New York City might again come into a mastery of the trade with the West,
as at the time when the Erie Canal was first completed and because of the inability of the
railroads to meet the demands of traffic, the legislature of New York, in 1903, appropriated
$100,000,000 for the enlargement of that waterway and the two branch canals, the Oswego and
Champlain. The proposed uniform depth is twelve feet and it is otherwise to be large enough
for boats of a thousand ton cargo or four times the capacity of boats now on the canal.

CHAPTER VIII

DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW SOUTH

[1904]

The term New South signifies the transition which has taken place through energy applied to
the opportunities which that section of the United States offers. The South has natural gifts
which in themselves will make it a marvel of wealth. The coast line measures 3,000 miles and
already the ports of New Orleans and Galveston are among the most important on our seaboard.
In 1898 the imports along the Gulf amounted to $13,000,000, and in 1908 they amounted to $59,350,000.
In 1898 the exports were valued at $202,000,000; in 1908 they were valued at nearly $400,000,000.
The completion of the Panama Canal will certainly increase the importance of the Southern seaboard
cities.

There are in the United States navigable streams amounting to 26,410 miles and of these the
South has 18,215 miles. Mr. Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture, has estimated that the waterpower
facilities of the South equal 5,000,000 horse-power for the six high-water months--five times
the amount New England has. By a system of reservoirs this supply could be doubled. Roughly
speaking, the country can be divided into three water-power districts: (1) the wholly undeveloped
district which lies about Birmingham, Alabama, the centre of the great iron and coal district
of the South; (2) a well-exploited district along the Chattahoochee, extending from Atlanta
to Columbus, Georgia; (3) a district which lies in the favored agricultural region of northern
South Carolina and southern North Carolina. Here about one-third of the easily available power
has been developed. To-day New England, poor in raw materials and having an area of only 66,000
square miles, manufactures as much as does the whole South which is rich in raw materials and
has an area of 1,000,000 square miles. It is hardly necessary to make forecasts--possibly it
is wiser to ask what can possibly hinder the development of this favored section.

James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture.

In minerals and forests the South is equally rich. The coal supply, according to the report
of the National Conservation Commission, amounts to 611,748,000,000 tons and the riches in
iron in the southern Appalachian district are equally enormous. Forty-one per cent of the remaining
forest area is in the same country. Unless a system of conservation is put into operation,
however, these vast timber resources will pass away, for the forests are being used at a rate
of more than three and one-half times the annual growth. Private interests own 125,000,000
acres in the South and practically none of the timber is being handled with the idea of conservation.
There are no "State forests"; neither are there adequate laws for the prevention of forest fires.

The economic advancement of the South during the past thirty years has been wonderful. The
tide of migration within our country no longer moves Westward as much as Southward and in its
wake has followed a flood of capital. The increase of population and capital is necessary to
the industrial growth of the South, and in spite of the recent influx the scarcity of laborers
remains a serious problem, the solution of which is absolutely necessary for the development
of the manufacturing industries as well as agriculture. Immigrants of good standing are constantly
sought by the States, and to cope with the problem some individuals have been guilty of operating
a system of peonage. Lack of efficiency in the laborers makes the problem still more perplexing.
Scientific investigations conducted with the aim of discovering the causes for this general
inefficiency have led to the conclusion that the eradication of the mosquito and hook-worm
will add greatly to the ability of the wage-earners. A systematic campaign in this direction
has been made possible through the recent gift of Mr. Rockefeller.

A field of cotton.

The South has always been largely an agricultural section, with the production of cotton as
the leading interest. In 1909 the yield was about 13,500,000 bales from about 32,000,000 acres.
In value the crop equals about twice the annual output of all the gold mines in the world.
The 8,000,000 bales which are exported annually represent an income to the United States of
about $400,000,000. The problem which has called for the most attention is that the average
output per acre has been decreasing for years. During the past few years the white farmers
have taken active steps to remedy this weakness. Agricultural experiment stations have conducted
investigations and the agricultural press has interpreted these results to the actual farmers
and has conducted a systematic agitation for an agricultural revolution. Associations have
been formed for the purpose of studying conditions and introducing improved methods in preparing
the soil and rotating crops. More of the food supply of the South is to be raised at home;
better homes and farm buildings are being erected, and better machinery is being used. The
invention of a mechanical cotton picker, which has been accomplished, should reduce materially
the cost of handling the crop.

Closely connected with this is the problem of roads. Where railroads are scarce good wagon
roads are all the more necessary. In the South (excluding Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oklahoma)
there are 500,000 miles of public roads serving a population of over 20,000,000 people. In
1908 there were only 17,700 miles of improved road. To help along this work good roads associations
have been formed in the various States.

The old methods of financing the plantation system are passing. The planters are breaking away
from the credit system which has kept them as borrowers and debtors and, as a result, they
have money for investments elsewhere. The great problems connected with cotton culture are
the labor supply and proper conservation of the soil. These solved, the friends of the South
confidently believe that thirty times as much cotton could be produced as is produced at present.
When one learns that only 145,200,000 acres out of 612,000,000 are now under cultivation, the
claim does not seem extravagant.

Loading cotton on the levee, New Orleans.

Southern farmers have learned that other products besides cotton pay well. Less than twenty
years ago practically no hay was raised for sale in the Gulf States. The red clover and timothy
which the planter thought could only be raised in the North are now cultivated in the South.
Iowa, the greatest hay-growing State in the Union, has for the past ten years averaged 1.58
tons per acre at an average value of $5.45 per ton. Mississippi during the same time has averaged
1.62 tons to the acre valued at over $10 a ton. Alfalfa has been found to be excellent feed
for stock and the yield, which averages from four to eight tons per acre, sells for from $10
to $18 a ton. Corn is being cultivated now and it is not uncommon to find yields of  100 bushels
to the acre and under the most favorable circumstances even twice that much has been raised
on a single acre. The prevailing high prices make the corn crop particularly valuable.

Stock-raising, which has never been indulged in to any extent, now gives excellent returns.
The mules which are used so extensively in the South are being raised at home instead of being
brought from the North. Beef animals and hogs are increasing in numbers and are being bred
more carefully. The great variety of food crops which ripen in rotation make the cost of hog-raising
very little--possibly two cents a pound will cover the cost of raising, butchering, and packing.
Sheep flourish in the pine regions where they are remarkably free from diseases. They range
all the year, needing little attention.

This shift in agricultural pursuits has been due in a measure to the appearance of the boll-weevil
which wrought havoc with the cotton crop for some years. It is possible that the change has
been decidedly beneficial when one notes that the value of products in 1899 was $705,000,000
and in 1909 about $1,430,000,000.

Agriculture is not the only interest of the New South. Northern capital has worked wonders
along industrial lines. Some communities have changed entirely from agriculture to manufacturing.
South Carolina is now second among the States in the manufacture of cotton; North Carolina
is third, and Georgia is not far behind. In Alabama Southern tobacco is manufactured. The steel
and iron industries, the furniture industry, the cottonseed-oil industry, and others are constantly
becoming more important. The effects of this industrial revolution are far reaching. Social
lines are shifting; a new society based upon business success and wealth seems to be supplanting
or at least breaking in upon the aristocracy of the ante-bellum South, based upon family and
public service. The ideal of success is changing and the ambitious young man now goes into
business, manufacturing, or engineering as often as into the profession of law and politics.
The laboring class has changed also. Years ago this class lived on farms and raised raw materials:
now it lives in the cities and fashions raw materials. The same social results are found here
as elsewhere, but on account of the conservatism and personal independence of the Southern
laborer, who is only a generation removed from the soil, these results are not in evidence
so soon. In the manufacturing districts there is the political unrest characteristic of the
North. Labor unions develop here and Socialism has some adherents. This tends to break the
political solidarity of the section and it is possible that in the not distant future the "Solid
South" may pass away.

The South is enthusiastic; it is alert to its opportunities and it is planning with hope for
the future. Through practical education wonders may be worked, and upon this practical education
for the rising generation the South bases its hopes. The new generation will make greater strides
in the utilization of the great natural gifts than the old one has. The race problem will be
solved in time, and the solution must come through the efforts of the Southern people, for
the best classes now believe that the South can prosper best when all the people, colored as
well as white, are brought to the highest standard of their efficiency.

CHAPTER IX

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S SECOND TERM

[1905-1907]

On June 1, 1905, an exposition was opened at Portland, Oregon, in commemoration of the Lewis
and Clark expedition (1804-1805). Four hundred acres of ground adjoining the principal residence
district, overlooking the Willamette River, were set aside for this purpose. There were extensive
exhibits by the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Holland, Italy, China, and other European
and Asiatic countries. The fair was, in general, the expression of the life and history of
the Pacific Northwest and the direct relationship between that region and the Orient. Many
national congresses were held in conjunction with it, such as the American Medical Association,
National Good Roads Association, and the National Conference of Charities and Correction.

The different interstate commerce acts, beginning with that of 1887 and including the railroad
rate bill of 1906, constitute a system of control established by the Federal Government over
persons and corporations engaged in interstate or foreign commerce; this includes the carrying
of persons and property by either rail or water. Pipe lines, telephone, telegraph, express,
and sleeping-car companies are also brought under the same provisions. The administration of
these laws was vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission consisting of seven members.

The important provisions of these laws may be summarized as follows: 1. All charges must be
just and reasonable. The commission was given power to fix maximum rates after investigation
of a complaint by either party to a dispute over rates. 2. Pooling agreements were prohibited.
3. It was made unlawful to make discriminations by giving to any particular person, corporation,
or locality an unreasonable advantage over others. Granting of passes was prohibited to other
than railroad employees, and granting of rebates was forbidden. 4. By the "long or short haul"
clause it was made unlawful for a common carrier to charge more for the transportation of passengers,
or the same kind of freight, over a shorter than a longer distance; provided the transportation
was under substantially similar circumstances and conditions over the same line and in the
same direction. 5. All rates were required to be published and posted where they might be consulted
by any person. 6. Railroad companies were forbidden to engage in other lines of business. 7.
Companies engaged in interstate commerce must have a uniform system of accounting. 8. They
are required to make reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission regularly.

This commission was also empowered to receive complaints, hear testimony, make orders correcting
abuses, or investigate conditions without previous complaint. It was given the power to suspend
the proposed increase of rates until their justice had been determined. Any person objecting
to an order of the commission was empowered to appeal to the "Commerce Court," which was created,
being made up of five circuit court Justices.

Nearly all of the States have passed laws relating to the purity of goods sold to the public.
Investigation showed, however, that twenty per cent of the articles of food in common use were
adulterated. This led to the passing of a far-reaching measure by Congress, 1906, known as
the Pure Food and Drugs law. It provides against the manufacture and sale of adulterated or
misbranded foods, drugs, medicines, or liquors in the District of Columbia, the Territories,
and the insular possessions of the United States, and prohibits the shipment of such goods
from one State to another or to a foreign country. To the Department of Agriculture was given
the power to enforce the law. Thus the public is protected against adulterated foods and medicines
and dishonest and misleading labels, and honest manufacturers are protected against fraudulent
competition.

For a number of years some of the European countries condemned American packing-house products.
Abuses in the processes of preparing preserved meats were brought vividly before Americans
by Upton Sinclair in his novel "The Jungle." The Department of Agriculture took up the problem
and a special investigation was ordered by President Roosevelt. The report showed the need
for more rigid inspection, and the agitation throughout the country forced the House of Representatives,
1906, somewhat reluctantly, to adopt the President's recommendation for a thorough inspection,
by government agents, of all processes and methods used in the meat packing-houses.

Early in the morning of April 18, 1906, San Francisco was visited by one of the most dreadful
disasters of modern times. An earthquake shock destroyed many of the important buildings in
the business part of the city. Other cities and towns along the coast and in the Santa Clara
Valley suffered greatly and a number of the buildings of Leland Stanford University, thirty
miles south of San Francisco, were demolished. Ninety per cent of the loss in San Francisco
was due to the conflagration which raged for two days. Fires broke out owing to the crossing
of electric wires. The water-mains were old and poorly laid and the force of the earthquake
had burst them. Firemen and soldiers fought the advance of the flames by destroying buildings
with dynamite. Not until an area three miles in length and two miles in breadth, including
all the business and the thickly settled residential sections, had been burned over was the
advance of the flames stopped. The estimated loss of life was 1,000, and property valued at
$300,000,000 was destroyed. Among the irreparable losses were several libraries, the collections
of the California Academy of Sciences, and many works of art. The noted Bancroft Library with
its collection of manuscripts was saved.

A quarter of a million people were rendered homeless and were without food and the means of
earning a livelihood. The sympathy of the world was aroused and offers of relief came from
all quarters. Two million five hundred thousand dollars was voted by Congress, and the total
relief fund amounted to $20,000,000. There was little suffering for lack of food and water,
owing to the co-operation of representatives of the Red Cross Association, a citizens' committee,
and the United States army in distributing supplies.

Refugees in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco.

One hundred thousand persons were sheltered in tents in Golden Gate Park. The courage and hopefulness
of the people did not desert them, and the rebuilding of the city was immediately begun. At
the end of a year one-half of the burned area had been rebuilt. The old frame and low brick
structures were replaced by modern buildings of steel and re-enforced concrete, for this type
had survived the earthquake shock. After two years, a new San Francisco, more beautiful and
more substantial, had risen on the site of the old.

Arts Building from the Auditorium.

On April 26, 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was opened. It was in commemoration of the first
English settlement in America. The southern shore of Hampton Roads, forty miles southeast of
old Jamestown, was selected as the site for the buildings. The historic idea was uppermost
in the exposition.  The colonial type of construction was dominant and good taste and moderation
were notable in the arrangement of the grounds and exhibits. Industrial and commercial progress
were emphasized. The United States had a special exhibit to illustrate the work of the different
departments. In the harbor, one of the finest in the world, was the greatest international
naval display ever witnessed. Every variety of war-vessel in existence was on exhibition besides
commercial and passenger boats from the great ports of the world.

CHAPTER X

THE FINANCIAL PANIC OF 1907

[1907]

Popular opinion ascribed three reasons for the panic of 1907. The first of these was the attitude
of the President toward certain great corporations. It is true that his attacks bared some
of the most deeply rooted evils which have always been at the bottom of our panics--dishonesty
in the administration of great aggregations of capital. Great were the lamentations and doleful
the predictions of what would happen should the President not change his policy of enforcing
the laws. The railway opponents of the President were sure the panic came from the Hepburn
Bill, which was passed early in 1906. If this had been dangerous to the welfare of the railroads
it is reasonable to assume that foreign capital would have been withdrawn from American railways
and that American capitalists interested in railroads would have attempted to avert financial
ruin by disposing of their holdings. Neither situation developed, for the European investors
increased their holdings and American capitalists continued to plan still greater investments
in railways.

The second general explanation was found in the unsound and reckless banking in New York City.
The dangers arising from trust companies had been known for several years. It came to be believed
that the deposits in these trust companies were being misused by the bank officers for the
promotion of various speculating schemes. The disclosures which came with the investigation
of the insurance companies fixed these beliefs more firmly in the minds of the people, and
the first break in confidence precipitated runs on the New York banks.

The third explanation was that the panic was due to the defects in our American currency system.

These were the popular explanations, but there were deep-seated causes which had worked to
bring about the existing conditions. The crisis was world-wide and was felt most in the countries
where there was a gold standard. In 1890 the world's supply of gold available for monetary
use was hardly $4,000,000,000; in 1907 it was more than $7,000,000,000. Along with this went
a rapid rise in the average price of commodities in gold-standard countries. Bank deposits
in the United States in 1907 were three times as great as they were in 1897. Amidst all this
prosperity there were forces which were bound to bring a reaction and among the most important
of these was the demand for capital for conversion into fixed forms. Ready capital was also
lessened relatively by the great losses experienced as a result of the Spanish-American War,
the Boer War, the Japanese-Russian War, the San Francisco earthquake, and the Baltimore fire.
These losses, which amounted to $3,000,000,000, came at a time when the world was just entering
upon a period of great industrial activity and needed all its capital. Much capital was absorbed
in the construction of railroads, industrial plants, development of foreign industries, etc.
These conditions brought about a tightening of money rates in Europe and American financial
centres; consequently rates of interest went up. Commercial paper which brought three to three
and one-half per cent in New York in 1897 brought seven per cent in 1907.

Closely allied to this movement was the increase in the number of securities issued by industrial
concerns. A few resourceful men, in order to do away with the evils of unrestricted competition,
devised a remedy in the form of mergers. Others of less capacity but greater daring saw opportunities
for money-making, and a craze for mergers and for the incorporation of private enterprises
swept over the country. By 1907 there were at least $38,500,000,000 worth of securities in
existence. The natural result was speculation. When investors began to fear the soundness of
the securities a collapse of credit was due.

The rapid development of trust companies had its effect. The cash reserves held by these companies
were small; their investments were not always conservative and the depositors were often suspicious.
This free expansion of business with little or no reference to cash reserve or capital gave
rise to another cause for the panic, which was not a matter of money. It was a matter of what
was in men's minds. There was a period of "muckraking" in which leaders financial and political
were severely critcised. Whether or not this criticism was justified by the exposition of the
frauds of the insurance companies and the questionable dealings of some other corporations
need not be discussed. The criticism created an attitude of mind throughout the nation, and
the first weakening of a bank brought on the deluge.

To the ordinary observer the panic of 1907 will date from October 22, when the Knickerbocker
Trust Company of New York closed its doors. Earlier in the month the Mercantile National Bank
had gotten into difficulties and had appealed to the clearing-house committee for aid, which
was given. Soon it was noted that the Knickerbocker Trust Company was in a precarious condition,
and the directors, following the example of the other bank, appealed to the same committee.
The investigation of the committee showed the company insolvent and aid was refused. When the
facts became known, a run on the bank began and it was compelled to close its doors. The lack
of confidence in other financial institutions was soon shown by similar runs.

No bank could stand the strain unaided. Now the Federal Government stepped in and Secretary
of the Treasury Cortelyou came in person to New York and deposited $40,000,000 of the surplus
from the United States Treasury to be used for the aid of beleaguered institutions. For more
than a week the crowds of depositors sought their money. The lines were not broken at night
until the police hit upon the plan of giving to each individual a ticket denoting his place
in the line. The Trust Company of America alone paid $34,000,000 across its counters and still
crowds thronged the streets. At length the enormous reserve of the Treasury was exhausted and
it became necessary to delay and deliberately to make slow payments. Through loans made by
other banks the Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust Company, which had endured the
hardest sieges, were saved and now the panic entered its second stage.

The country was thoroughly aroused, and to avoid a nation-wide raid upon banking houses the
bankers took radical steps. The first measure resorted to was the enforcement of the rule requiring
savings-bank depositors, at the option of the institution, to give sixty days' notice before
withdrawing deposits. The second expedient was one which had been resorted to during former
years of financial unsteadiness. "Emergency currency" was issued. This currency took various
forms. (1) The clearing-house loan certificates issued in denominations ranging from $500 to
$20,000, used for settling inter-bank balances; (2) clearing-house certificates in currency
dimensions to be used by banks in paying their customers; (3) clearing-house checks which took
the form of checks drawn upon particular banks and signed by the manager of the clearing-house;
(4) cashier's checks (in opposition to the National Bank act) secured by approved collateral;
(5) New York drafts which were cashier's checks drawn against actual balances in New York banks;
(6) negotiable certificates of deposit, and (7) pay checks payable to bearer drawn by bank
customers upon their banks in currency denominations. These were guaranteed by the firm which
issued them.

Other devices were used to aid the banks and to block the spread of the panic by limiting cash
payments by the banks. The governors of Nevada, Oregon, and California declared legal holidays
continuously for several weeks, thereby allowing the banks to remain closed. In some places
the size of withdrawals was limited to $10 or $25 daily.

The panic was felt to a great degree on the New York Stock Exchange because the banks refused
to make loans, but this stringency was relieved by a bankers' pool, headed by J. P. Morgan,
which loaned $25,000,000 at the prevailing rate of interest. With the strengthening of the
Stock Exchange another stage of the panic passed.

In spite of the use of the surplus of the Treasury the banks showed a loss of $50,000,000 in
actual cash during the five weeks of the panic. Now demands were made on foreign countries
for gold. The Bank of England made no move to block the great withdrawals of gold except to
raise the official discount to seven per cent. The flow of gold did much to stay the ebb of
confidence.

Some contended for an issue of paper money and after a long discussion by the officials of
the Treasury, it was decided to sell $50,000,000 worth of Panama two per cent bonds and $100,000,000
worth of three per cent notes in the hope of calling from its hiding-place the money which
was being hoarded. The result of the venture was not satisfactory and the loan operations soon
ceased.

Gradually financial affairs righted themselves. The emergency currency was redeemed, the runs
on banks ceased, confidence slowly returned, and business picked up, although by the middle
of 1908 the volume was scarcely half of what it had been a year before. The number of bank
failures had been comparatively small. Only twenty-one banks were obliged to suspend payment,
while in 1893 the number was 160.

Naturally there was much discussion concerning the defects of our financial system, of the
needs of elastic currency, of a central bank, etc., when the Sixtieth Congress met in December,
1907. Several bills were offered for the establishment of a central bank; some for the issue
of a special currency by the government; others for the legalization of certificates and currency
created by clearing-house associations. The aversion of the people to the centralization of
the banking business in the hands of a few of the great money powers made the establishment
of a central bank out of the question.

The bills which were discussed at any length were the Fowler Bill, the Vreeland Bill, and the
Aldrich Bill. The first was discarded, although it had merits, and the two branches of Congress
were unable to agree upon either of the others. The result was a compromise measure which became
the Aldrich-Vreeland Act.

The important provisions of this act are as follows: (1) Ten or more national banking associations,
each with an unimpaired capital and surplus of not less than twenty per cent and an aggregate
capital and surplus of not less than $5,000,000, may form national currency associations. These
associations are to have power to render available, for the basis of additional circulation,
"any securities, including commercial paper, held by a national banking association."

(2) To obtain this additional circulation, any bank belonging to a national currency association
having circulating notes outstanding secured by United States bonds to an amount not less than
forty per cent of its capital stock, and having the required unimpaired capital and surplus,
may deposit approved securities with the currency association and be empowered by the Secretary
of the Treasury to issue additional circulating notes to an amount not to exceed seventy-five
per cent of the cash value of the securities. If the securities are State or municipal bonds
the issue must not exceed ninety per cent of the market value of the bonds.

(3) The banks and assets of all banks belonging to the currency association are liable to the
United States for the redemption of this additional currency, and the association may at any
time require that additional securities be deposited. All banks are held liable to make good
the securities of any bank in the association.

(4) The total amount of circulating notes outstanding for any bank shall not at any time exceed
the amount of its unimpaired capital and surplus, neither shall the amount of such notes in
the United States exceed $500,000,000 at any time. The amount issued in each State shall bear
the same relation to the total amount issued in the United States as the unimpaired capital
and surplus of the banks of that State bear to the unimpaired capital and surplus of the banks
of the United States.

(5) The tax on circulating notes secured by United States bonds bearing two per cent or less
shall be one-half of one per cent; if secured by United States bonds bearing more than two
per cent, the tax shall be one per cent. If the securities are other than United States bonds,
the tax shall be at a rate of five per cent per annum for the first month and afterward an
additional tax of one per cent per annum for each month until a tax of ten per cent per annum
is reached.

(6) The redemption of the notes may take place by the banks depositing with the Treasurer of
the United States lawful money to replace the securities deposited.

(7) The formation of a national monetary commission to inquire into and report to Congress
necessary or desirable changes in the banking and currency laws was provided for.

CHAPTER XI

IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION

[1907]

Since the organization of our government nearly 29,000,000 foreigners have come to the United
States. The flow of immigration first assumed large proportions during the decade 1831-1840
and since that time one wave after another has reached our shores. The last one, and the one
which has caused the greatest alarm, gathered force about 1897 and reached its full tide in
the first decade of the twentieth century, when over 8,000,000 aliens landed at our ports.

During this period (1820-1910) the character of immigration has changed. Prior to 1880 the
greater part of it came from northern Europe, but since that time the number has constantly
fallen off, and the flow from southern Europe has greatly increased. During the decade 1871-1880
Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia sent only 181,000 of 2,262,000 aliens who landed in the
United States--about eight per cent. During the decade 1901-1910, 8,130,000 immigrants came
to our shores, and of these 5,800,000, or over 70 per cent, were from these three countries.
In 1901 Austria-Hungary sent, 113,400; in 1907 about 338,500, but owing to the passage of the
immigration law in 1907 the number fell abruptly, but by 1910 had again increased to 260,000.
The same is true of Italy. In 1901 about 136,000 came; in 1907 nearly 286,000, and in 1910
about 215,500. Russia sent 85,000 in 1901, some 260,000 in 1907, and 187,000 in 1910. The numbers
from northern Europe do not approach these. The immigration from the British Isles does not
reach the 100,000 mark; from Germany only 30,000 come yearly.

Causes for this influx are varied. Many come desirous of owning homes, a pleasure out of reach
in their home country on account of high prices. Free institutions attract others. A land which
offers free schools to all regardless of race or creed, religious freedom, and the opportunity
to play some part in the political life of the state is naturally attractive. Some come to
escape military service, others with the idea of making money and returning to their native
land. Density of population and the accompanying excessive competition in the struggle for
existence also play a part.

Hundreds of letters telling of the general prosperity in America and contrasting this with
the condition at home, do their work with the disheartened peasants. It is said that half of
our immigrants come on tickets paid for by friends in America. The large employers of labor,
and even the States themselves, are constantly calling for laborers. Ours is a huge, half-developed
country, and the development of our resources, particularly the coal and iron industries, the
cotton; rice, cane, and tobacco industries, and the railways demands thousands of helpers.

Emigrants bound for America.

The steamship companies which have found an extremely profitable business in the transportation
of immigrants have used various means to increase the numbers. Agents are said to be in all
European countries soliciting trade.

Although most of the European countries have placed restrictions upon emigration, these restrictions
unfortunately do not retard the emigration of the undesirable classes. As a result America
was called upon early to legislate on this problem. The first act was in 1819 and was aimed
to regulate the transportation of immigrants. The laws of 1875, 1882, 1891, 1893, and 1903
dealt with the class of immigrants to be admitted. The acts did not accomplish the end for
which they were framed, and the question was taken up again by Congress which, after a lengthy
discussion, passed the act of 1907.  No great change in policy was effected by this law which,
for the most part, only revised the wording of the old laws and modified the methods of regulation.
The head tax of two dollars, hitherto levied on each alien, was doubled but was made inapplicable
to immigrants from our insular possessions or to aliens who had resided for a year either in
the British possessions in North America, or in Cuba or Mexico. All aliens suffering from tuberculosis
or loathsome diseases or those who were "mentally or physically defective, such mental or physical
defect being of a nature which may affect the ability . . . to earn a living," were excluded.
Children under sixteen unaccompanied by a parent were excluded. Steamship companies were placed
under additional restrictions to insure against their violation of the act. Should an immigrant
within a period of three years be found to have entered the country contrary to the terms of
the act, he was to be deported and the transportation company responsible for his coming would
be held liable for the expense of his deportation.

The effect of the new law can be seen in the immigration statistics--the number of immigrants
for the year 1908 is but little more than half as great as the number for 1907. The chief decrease
was in the stream from southern Europe. This decrease cannot be attributed entirely to the
act of 1907, but must be accounted for in part by the panic of 1907. Observations extending
over a long period of years have disclosed the fact that the ebb and flow of the tide of immigration
is closely attached to the periods of economic prosperity and depression.

When the races of northern Europe contributed the greater part of our immigrants there was
a general feeling that this was a decided advantage to us. The people were readily assimilated
into our population and were in general intelligent, industrious citizens who soon acquired
a patriotic love for America and its institutions.  The serious problems came with the increased
number of southern Europeans.

For years Italians emigrated to South America, particularly to Brazil and the Argentine Republic,
where the climate, race customs, and language were more to their liking than in the north.
A diminution of prosperity there has turned part of the tide northward. About eighty per cent
of our Italians come from southern Italy, a fact explained by the difference between the industrial
conditions in the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. In the south agriculture is
the only industry, and it frequently suffers from climatic conditions, the resulting losses
bearing heavily upon the population. Conditions are aggravated by an unequal division of taxes
between the north and the south. Often the only alternative to starvation is emigration. During
the past decade 2,000,000 Italians have come to us and, according to estimates, about two-thirds
of them have settled in the cities of the Northern States, a condition detrimental to the foreign
and our social organization alike. These Italians, peasants and experts in fruit culture by
training, become day laborers, thus losing their greatest productive power. The Italian who
keeps away from the city finds his lot more agreeable. Wherever they have settled as farmers
they have been uniformly successful. The person who knows only the Italian of the tenements
has little sympathy for him, in spite of the fact that many of this race have proved themselves
to be quiet, sober, and useful citizens.

U. S. IMMIGRANT STATION, ELLIS ISLAND, N. Y.

The Slavic immigration since 1880 has been mainly from the more primitive districts out of
touch with the civilization of western Europe. These people have come, not as settlers, but
as laborers in the mines, factories, and foundries, planning to remain here for a time, earn
as much as possible, and return to their native land.

In 1899 statistics began to be compiled by means of which the race and nationality of aliens
might be determined. From 1899 to 1907 about seventy-two per cent of the Slavic immigration
came from Austria-Hungary. Since 1900 at least 100,000 aliens from this country have come to
the United States each year; in 1905, 1906, and 1910 the number exceeded 250,000 each year,
and in 1907 it was 340,000. In this crowd came Bohemians Poles, Slovaks, Ruthenians, Slovenians,
Croatians, Bulgarians, Servians, Montenegrins, and other allied peoples. They are distributed
over various parts of the land. Pennsylvania, on account of its mines, gathers by far the greatest
number--in 1906 there were about 500,000 Slavs in the State; New York had nearly 200,000, and
Illinois about 134,000. The Bohemians and Poles seem inclined to farm, but in the main the
Slav laborers have busied themselves in the coal, coke, iron, and steel industries. Very seldom
do the Slavs take to petty street traffic, as do the Jews and Italians, but prefer the harder
and better paid work in the mines and foundries.

The Russians make the smallest Slavic group in America. Although many Russians are reported
among the immigrants, only about five per cent are native born Russians, the rest being Jews,
Poles, Finns, and Lithuanians.

About one-eighth of our European immigrants are Jews. By the law of 1769 the Jews in Russia
are compelled to live within certain territorial limits known as the Jewish Pale, and about
ninety-four per cent comply with the regulation. The law of 1882 has further restricted the
places of residence, for Jews are now prohibited from buying or renting lands outside the limits
of the cities or incorporated towns. Their educational advantages are limited by law; few are
admitted to the bar and few to the other learned professions. To these disabilities the Russian
government has added the terror of persecution, which will explain why 150,000 Jews come to
America each year. In all there are 1,250,000 here.

The question of Oriental immigration has caused much comment in our Pacific Coast States for
several years. Before 1900 the total number of Japanese coming to America seldom reached 1,500
a year. Since that time about 12,000 have come each year, except in 1903 when 20,000 came and
1907 when the number reached 30,000. Seventy per cent of this number, however, went to Hawaii.
Over-population and economic depression in their native land have caused this exodus. Most
of these immigrants are laborers--skilful, energetic and efficient--who apparently desire to
become citizens. Among the better classes are many who have attained eminence in various lines
of work in our country. In scientific investigation the names of Takamine, Noguchi, Yatsu,
Takami, Asakawa, and Iyenaga are well known. The names of those who have been more than ordinarily
successful in business would make a long list. The most serious objections to the Japanese
arise in the coast States where these immigrants have raised a serious labor problem. The people
of these commonwealths also fear a race problem which in gravity will rival the one in the
Southern States. It is claimed that even now, when the number of Orientals is small, the enforcement
of law is exceedingly difficult in the Chinese quarters, while the control of the Japanese
is next to impossible since they do not congregate in certain sections of the cities as do
the Chinese. It is claimed that the 2,000,000 whites who live on the Pacific Coast will be
swamped and lose control of the government if this Oriental immigration is not entirely prohibited.
The Chinese do not cause so much anxiety. Since the passage of the exclusion act thirty years
ago, few have come to the United States--scarcely more than 2,000 a year. As laborers they
are efficient, patient, and honest in keeping labor contracts.

Gypsies excluded and deported as undesirable.

GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AT ELLIS ISLAND

These swarms of foreigners who come to us each year are causing uneasiness in the minds of
the thinking people. Can our foreign population be growing more rapidly than our power to assimilate
it? Is this element as dangerous to our civilization as we think? Has criminality increased
as a result of increased immigration? Has this element increased labor agitations during the
past decade? Some contend that we are rapidly approaching the limit of our power of assimilation
and that we are in constant danger of losing the traits which we call American. The immigrants
from southern Europe are in too many cases deficient in education. This lack of education may
or may not prove a danger. So far it seems to have been the rule that in the second generation
these foreigners have shown themselves extremely anxious to take advantage of the opportunities
offered by our free schools.

One of the most serious charges made against the Americanized foreigner has been that through
him there has developed in our political system a strain of corruption which endangers our
institutions. Political corruption did not come with the immigrants: it was known in all its
forms years ago. This much can be said, however: the worst class of foreign-born citizens has
ever proved to be a support of corrupt political bosses. Our city governments have been notoriously
corrupt and the cities harbor the great masses of foreigners. The high cost of living in the
cities and the relatively low wages force the aliens into poor and crowded quarters which tend
to weaken them physically and degrade them morally and socially. Among the Italians of the
cities there appears to be a vicious element composed of social parasites who found gambling
dens, organize schemes of black-mail, and are the agents of the dreaded Black Hand. It is the
class which furnishes aids for the lowest political bosses and furnishes the bad reputation
for the Italians.

Group of Cossack immigrants considered desirable and qualified to enter.

An investigation of the nationalities in the city of Chicago has been made by Professor Ripley,
of Harvard. The results illustrate the wonderful dimensions of the problem which the cities
confront in the assimilation of the foreign element. In the case of Chicago, were the foreigners
(those not American beyond the third generation) to be eliminated, the population would dwindle
from 2,000,000 to about 100,00. In this city fourteen languages are spoken by groups of not
less than 10,000 persons each. Newspapers are regularly published in ten different languages
and church services conducted in twenty different tongues. Measured by the size of its foreign
colonies, Chicago is the second Bohemian city in the world, the third Swedish, the fourth Polish,
and the fifth German. There is one large factory employing over 4,000 people representing twenty-four
nationalities. Here the rules of the establishment are printed in eight languages. So it is
with the other cities. New York, for example, has a larger Italian population than Rome, and
is the greatest Jewish city, for there are in the city some 800,000 Jews. In all eighty per
cent of the population of New York are foreigners or the children of foreigners. In Boston
the per cent reaches seventy and in Milwaukee about eighty-six.

The charge that criminality has increased rapidly with the increased immigration from southern
Europe seems to be substantiated by statistics. From 1904 to 1908 the number of aliens charged
with committing grave crimes nearly doubled. While this fact will not prove the point, it suggests
thought on the question.

It has been truthfully said that the fundamental problem in this question of immigration is
most frequently overlooked. Back of the statistics of illiteracy, pauperism, criminality, and
the economic value of immigrants lies another one of great proportions. What has been the effect
upon our native stock? What has been the expense, to our native stock, of this increase of
population and wealth through immigration? The decreasing birth rate of our native population
some contend is due to the industrial competition caused by the foreign element. If this be
true, the foreigners have supplanted not supplemented the American, and the question arises,
how long can the assimilation go on before we lose our American characteristics?

Swedish immigrant family considered desirable and qualified to enter.

The number of Europeans who return to their native lands after living a time in the United
States is comparatively small and the loss is not great. The emigration of our farmers to Canada
is a more serious thing. Since 1897 the Dominion Government has fostered high-class immigration.
Canadian agencies have been established in many of our Western cities with the avowed object
of attracting farmers to the Provinces. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has taken up the
pioneering business. It sells the land, builds the home and the necessary buildings, breaks
the fields, plants the first crop, and hands over to the prospective settler a farm under cultivation.
In return the railway demands high-class immigrants and, to insure this, no settler can take
possession of a railway farm unless he can show $2,000 in his own right. Between 1897 and the
close of 1910 Canada gained by immigration nearly 2,000,000 inhabitants. Of these, 630,000
were from the United States, and it is estimated that those who went from the United States
during the past five years took with them $267,000,000 in cash and settlers' effects. The end
of the movement has not come, for the railway companies have now gone into the reclamation
of arid lands. Since 1908 over 1,000,000 acres of arid land in Alberta have been placed under
irrigation, and the work of reclaiming another equally large section has begun. The American
farmers who are taking advantage of this opportunity form a class which we cannot afford to lose.

CHAPTER XII

NOTABLE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS

[1907]

The Northern Securities Company is a corporation, formed under the laws of New Jersey, for
the purpose of obtaining control of a majority of the stock of the Northern Pacific Railroad
and part of the stock of the Great Northern Railroad. These roads, which parallel each other
from Lake Superior to the Pacific, have been held by the courts, in the case of Pearsall vs.
the Great Northern Railway, to be competing lines.

The organizers of the Northern Securities Company contended that their ultimate purpose in
organizing the company was to control the two railway systems not for the purpose of suppressing
competition, but to create and develop a volume of trade among the States of the Northwest
and between the Orient and the United States by establishing and maintaining a permanent schedule
of cheap transportation rates.

When the company had completed its organization and the full significance of the organization
was known, the State of Minnesota instituted proceedings against the company in the State courts.
Later the case was transferred to the federal Circuit Court and eventually carried to the Supreme
Court of the United States, where the contentions of the State were overruled.

In March, 1902, a suit was instituted by the United States in the Circuit Court of the eighth
federal district. The judges who sat upon the case decided unanimously that the acquisition
of the stock of the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern Railways by the Securities Company
was a combination for the restraint of trade among the States, and therefore a violation of
the Sherman act. A decree was issued by the court prohibiting the company from acquiring any
more of the stock of these roads and from exercising any control over either of the roads in
question.

Lamar. O. W. Holmes.      J. M. Harlan.  E. D. White.   J. E. McKenna  W. R. Day.

The case was carried to the Supreme Court which by a vote of five to four, affirmed the decree
of the lower court. In the majority opinion the court took the position that the mere acquisition
by the Securities Company of the stock of the two roads was in itself a combination for the
restraint of trade. The power to do things made unlawful by the Sherman act had been acquired
and this in effect violated that act.

Another point was made clear by the court. The defendants had vigorously denied that the power
of Congress over interstate commerce was extended to the regulation of railway corporations
organized under State laws, by reason of these corporations engaging in interstate commerce.
The court declared that while this was not the intention of the Government, the Government
was acting within its rights when it took steps, not prohibited under the Constitution, for
protecting the freedom of interstate commerce. Furthermore, it was held that no State corporation
could stand in the way of the enforcement of the national will by extending its authority into
other States. In substance the court denied the right of any State to endow a corporation of
its creation with power to restrain interstate commerce.

The contention of the defendants, that the Sherman law was intended to prohibit only those
restraints which are unreasonable at common law, was dismissed on the ground that this question
had been passed upon by the lower court in other cases.

The dissenting opinions were two in number and were written by Justice White and Justice Holmes.

Several conclusions of importance may be drawn from the court's decision.

1. That Congress may forbid transactions of purchase and sale when such transactions confer
on an individual or group of individuals the power to destroy competition.

2. No State can create corporations and confer upon them power to interfere with interstate
commerce.

3. The Sherman law is not to be interpreted as forbidding the reasonable restraints of trade
which are not objectionable at common law.

The Bailey case is one of importance by reason of the fact that the decision handed down by
the Supreme Court was an effective blow against the "peonage system," which is an evasion of
the constitutional prohibition of slavery. The Alabama law provides, in effect, that the mere
act of quitting work on the part of a contract laborer is conclusive evidence that he is guilty
of the crime of defrauding his employer.

Alonzo Bailey was engaged by a corporation to do farm work and signed a contract for a year,
the wages being $12 a month. The company, to bind the contract, paid Bailey $15 down and it
was agreed that thereafter he should be paid at the rate of $10.75 a month. After working a
month and a few days he left. Instead of suing him for a breach of contract and recovery of
damages, the company caused the arrest of Bailey on the charge of an attempt to defraud. No
direct evidence could be produced that this was his intention, but the law expressly authorized
the jury to find him guilty of fraud, on the ground that he quitted work. The accused was not
allowed to testify as to his unexpressed intention. His opportunity to escape prison was to
pay back the $15 or to work out the sum. In case neither was done, he was to be fined double
the amount paid at the time of making the contract or go to work at hard labor.

The attorneys for Bailey, wishing to test the constitutionality of the Alabama law, carried
the case to the Supreme Court of the United States. The constitutionality of the law was called
into question on the following grounds: (1) That it violated the prohibition against involuntary
service; (2) it denied the plaintiff in error the right of due process of law; (3) that by
laying a burden on the employee and no equivalent burden on the employer, the law denied to
the plaintiff the constitutional right of equal protection of the laws.

The decision of the court was not unanimous. Justices Holmes and Lurton upheld the Alabama
law, but the majority, in an opinion written by Justice Hughes, declared the law in conflict
with the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits slavery or involuntary servitude, except as
a punishment for crime.

The significance of the decision is this--slavery has been outlawed by our highest court, and
one more legal barrier to the progress of the black man has been removed.

The case of Loewe vs. Lawler, probably better known to the public as the Danbury Hatters  case,
was decided by the Supreme Court in February, 1908, Chief Justice Fuller rendering the decision.
The action was brought originally in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut
and, after passing through the Circuit Court of Appeals, reached the Supreme Court late in 1907.

The plaintiffs, who were manufacturers of hats, complained that the defendants--members of
the United Hatters of North America, an organization which was a part of the American Federation
of Labor--were "engaged in a combined scheme and effort to force all manufacturers of fur hats
in the United States, including the plaintiffs, against their will and their previous policy
of carrying on their business, to organize their workmen . . . into an organization of the
said combination known as The United Hatters of North America, or, as the defendants and their
confederates term it, to unionize their shops, with the intent thereby to control the employment
of labor in, and the operation of, said factories . . . and to carry out such scheme, effort
and purpose by restraining and destroying the interstate trade and commerce of such manufacturers
by means of intimidation of, and threats made to such manufacturers and their customers in
the several States, of boycotting them, their product and their customers . . . until . . .
the said manufacturers should yield to the demand to unionize their factories."

These methods had been successfully employed before, as is evidenced by the fact that seventy
of the eighty-two manufacturers of fur hats had been compelled to accept the conditions set
forth by the American Federation of Labor. The boycott against the Danbury, manufacturers began
in July, 1902, and was widened to include the wholesalers who handled the goods of the Danbury
concern, the dealers who bought from the wholesalers, and customers who bought from these dealers.
Notices to this effect were printed in the official organs of the American Federation of Labor
and the United Hatters of North America. To make the feeling against the manufacturers more
intense, statements were published to the effect that they were practising an unfair, un-American
policy in discriminating against competent union men in favor of the cheap unskilled foreign labor.

The counsel for the defence argued that no case could be set up under the Sherman act, since
the defendants were not engaged in interstate commerce, implying that a combination of laborers
was not a violation of the act. The court held that an action could be maintained in this case
and that the combination as it existed was "in restraint of trade" in the sense designated
by the act of 1890. The significance of the decision lies in the fact that the Supreme Court
made no distinctions between classes. Records of Congress show that efforts were made to exempt,
by legislation, organizations of farmers and laborers from the operation of the act and that
their efforts failed. Therefore the court held that every contract, combination, or conspiracy
in restraint of trade was illegal and cited a former decision (The United States vs. Workingmen's
Amalgamated Council) to show that the law interdicted combinations of workingmen as well as
capital.

The Sherman act was passed by Congress in 1890. It was entitled "An Act to Protect Trade and
Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies." Since its passage various cases falling
under it have been decided, but until the decisions in the Standard Oil Company and the American
Tobacco Company cases the extent and intent of this act have not been understood.

In the Standard Oil case the question involved was this: Was the Sherman act violated by the
existence and conduct of this corporation, which owned or controlled some eighty corporations
originally in competition? The control had been acquired for the purpose of monopolizing the
sale and distribution of petroleum products in the United States, and had been acquired by
various means of combination with the intent either by fair or unfair methods "to drive others
from the field and to exclude them from their right to trade."  The proof was that, to destroy
competitors, prices had been temporarily reduced in various localities, spies had been used
on competitors' business, bogus independent companies operated, and rebates given and taken.

In the case of the American Tobacco Company, there were more than one hundred formerly competing
companies united under the control of a single organization and the market in nearly all tobacco
products was monopolized. This domination was secured "by methods devised in order to monopolize
the trade by driving competitors out of business."

In each case the court found the defendants guilty on the grounds that the agreements and the
conduct of the defendants indicated a purpose to destroy competitors and monopolize trade in
certain articles. The desired result was accomplished by wrongful means which injured the public
as well as the competitors.

The facts in neither case required the consideration of the question as to whether the Sherman
act prohibited every unification of formerly competing properties and every restraint of trade,
reasonable or unreasonable but, owing to the uncertainty of the public concerning the meaning
of the law, the court stated definitely the meaning and scope of the act. From appearances
the Supreme Court has practically amended the Sherman act by limiting its application to "unreasonable"
restraints of trade. The significance of the decisions lies here rather than in the fact that
both companies were compelled to dissolve. The best legal authorities believe that the new
interpretation of "reasonableness" and "unreasonableness" of restraint of trade has increased
rather than decreased the effectiveness of the law, inasmuch as the meaning has always been
obscure. The new policy is a notification to combinations of capital that to exist without
prosecution they must not resort to any unfair, oppressive, or illegal methods to control competition
or crush competitors.

CHAPTER XIII

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S SECOND TERM--CONTINUED

[1907]

While President Roosevelt advocated peace, he believed that the best means to preserve peace
was suitable preparation for war. In his message to Congress, 1904, he said; "There is no more
patriotic duty before us as a people than to keep the navy adequate to the needs of this country's
position. Our voice is now potent for peace, and is so potent because we are not afraid of
war. But our protestations would neither receive nor deserve the slightest attention if we
were impotent to make them good." At all times he urged a larger and more efficient navy. For
years, before he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he had been a student of naval affairs.
He found that there was no programme for building ships as in the European countries, and that
there was general unpreparedness for war.

Before the war with Spain, the American navy was so inferior that it was excluded from any
table of the principal navies of the world. Had the United States possessed a few more battleships
at that time, it is probable that war would not have occurred. Spanish authorities had been
told by naval experts that their navy was superior to ours.

Profiting by that experience, plans for a larger navy were projected. By the close of the year
1907 there were about 300 vessels in the navy manned by 35,377 men. In comparative strength
it ranked second only to that of Great Britain. Not only was there an increase in the number
of vessels but there was great improvement in marksmanship and in the handling of ships. In
the battle of Santiago it has been estimated that about five per cent of the shells struck
the enemy. During the year 1902 Rear-Admiral Robley D. Evans introduced regular and frequent
target practice. So effective was this work that in 1908, at ranges twice as great as at Santiago,
gunners throughout the fleet averaged sixty per cent and one vessel scored eighty per cent.
Rapidity of fire also was increased nearly fourfold.

It was the custom to send the fleet each winter to the Caribbean Sea for manoeuvres, which
lasted about four months. In December, 1907, the Atlantic fleet, comprising sixteen battle-ships
and a flotilla of torpedo-boats, began a cruise around the world. President Roosevelt steadily
adhered to the plan in the face of the most extravagant denunciation on the part of those who
declared that it could be considered only as a menace toward Japan. Naval experts claimed,
however, that the experience to be gained by this cruise, such as practice in handling ships
in all kinds of weather, the renewal of stores and coal, and the meeting of other problems
incident to actual warfare, justified the experiment.

Copyright. 1908. by Harris & Ewing. Rear-Admiral Robley D. Evans.

Under command of Rear-Admiral Evans the fleet reached Rio Janeiro on January 12. Unusual honors
were tendered the men by the Brazilian government and people. The day of their arrival was
made a national festival. In reply to the friendly greeting from the Brazilian government President
Roosevelt wrote: "The war-ships on this cruise exist for no other purpose than to protect peace
against possible aggression. As between the United States and Brazil these ships are not men-of-war,
but messengers of friendship and good-will." There were similar manifestations on the part
of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The visit of the fleet to these countries was regarded as a
compliment. They were permitted to see something of the strength of the republic at the north
and learned that the Monroe Doctrine might be enforced, if need be, by a navy of the first
rank. Notable ceremonies attended the arrival of the fleet at Honolulu, Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne,
and Manila. A despatch to a London paper said: "It is beyond question that the United States
is no longer a Western but a cosmic power. America is now a force in the world, speaking with
authoritative accent, and wielding a dominant influence such as ought to belong to her vast
wealth, prosperity, and importance."

Rear-Admiral Charles S. Sperry.

At Auckland Rear-Admiral Evans, who had spent forty-eight years in the navy, having reached
the age limit of sixty-two years, was succeeded in command by Rear-Admiral Sperry. Unusual
honors were accorded the fleet by Japan. Each American warship was escorted into the harbor
of Yokohama by a Japanese vessel of the same class and many other evidences of friendship were
manifest during their visit. The fleet then proceeded to China, through the Suez Canal and
the Strait of Gibraltar, and at the end of one year and sixty-eight days, after covering 45,000
miles, dropped anchor in Hampton Roads. The accomplishment of this feat, without precedent
in naval annals, still farther contributed to the establishment of the prestige of the United
States as a great world power.

In 1889 the government of the United States purchased from the Indians a large irregular tract
of land not then occupied by them and erected it into a separate territory under the name of
Oklahoma. When it was opened for settlement, April 22, 1889, a horde of settlers who had been
waiting on the borders rushed in to take possession of the lands. Cities and towns sprang up
as if by magic. The loose system of government exercised by the five civilized tribes became
steadily more ineffective when the Indian Territory was thus brought into contact with white
settlers. By 1893 affairs had become so confused that Congress decided to take steps toward
the ultimate admission of the territory into the Union as a State. A committee of the Senate
reported that the system of government exercised by the Indians cannot be continued, that it
is not only non-American but it is radically wrong, and a change is imperatively demanded in
the interest of the Indians and the whites alike, and such change cannot be much longer delayed,
and that there can be no modification of the system. It cannot be reformed; it must be abandoned
and a better one substituted.

Gradually the five tribes--Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole--were shorn of
their governmental powers. Lands were allotted in severalty, certain coal, oil, and asphalt
lands being reserved. A public school system was established and maintained by general taxation.

In his message to Congress, 1905, President Roosevelt recommended the immediate admission of
Oklahoma and Indian Territory as one State and Arizona and New Mexico as another. A statehood
bill embodying this recommendation was passed by the House, but was amended in the Senate so
as to strike out the provision relative to the admission of New Mexico and Arizona. Opposition
to the admission of the last two territories as one State came principally from the great mining
companies of Arizona supported by the railroad corporations. They were in practical control
of the territory with hundreds of millions of dollars in property. They were fearful of the
loss of control and an increase of taxation under such a combination. Finally an act was passed
by Congress, in 1906, enabling the people of Oklahoma and Indian Territory to form a constitution
and State government and be admitted into the Union. The enabling act provided that all male
persons over the age of twenty-one years who were citizens of the United States or who were
members of any Indian nation or tribe in said Oklahoma and Indian Territory, and who had resided
within the limits of said proposed State for at least six months next preceding the election,
should be entitled to vote for delegate or serve as delegates in a constitutional convention.
A number of Indians were delegates in this convention. The constitution, which was adopted
by the voters, September 17, 1907, was greatly criticised on account of its radicalism. The
new State, the forty-seventh, was formally proclaimed by the President in 1908. It has an area
of 70,000 square miles. In 1900 the population was 800,000 which was increased to 1,500,000
by the date of admission. The wonderful climate and fertile soil together with the energy of
its population have continued to attract thousands of immigrants each year.

The exclusion of Japanese students from the public schools of San Francisco, 1906, seemed 
for a time to augur grave results. One-half of the ninety Japanese who were in attendance upon
these schools were above sixteen years of age and were taught in the classes with little children.
The order of the San Francisco school board excluding the Japanese was in harmony with the
California law which permitted local school boards to segregate Mongolians in schools apart
from those for white children. But this order nullified our treaty with Japan which provided
that the subjects of that nation should be granted the same personal rights when in this country
that our own citizens enjoy.

President Roosevelt acted with promptness and decision. His attitude was shown in his message
to Congress, December, 1907, in which he said: "To shut them out from the public schools is
a wicked absurdity . . . .

But the problem was not settled, for early in the year 1909 anti-Japanese resolutions were
brought before the legislatures of California, Nevada, Oregon, and two or three other Pacific
States. The bills before the legislature of California provided:

1. For the segregation of Japanese and other Orientals in residential
   quarters at the option of municipalities.

2. That aliens should not own land in California.

3. That aliens should not become directors in California corporations.

4. For separate schools for Japanese students.

On February 8, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to the Speaker of the California assembly
giving the Government's views on the pending bills. "The policy agreed to by both governments,"
he said, "aims at mutuality of obligation and behavior. In accordance with it the purpose is
that the Japanese shall come here exactly as Americans go to Japan, which is in effect that
travellers, students, persons engaged in international business, men who sojourn for pleasure
or study, and the like, shall have the freest access from one country to the other, and shall
be sure of the best treatment, but that there shall be no settlement in mass by the people
of either country in the other." While there is nothing in the Constitution or laws to prevent
the President from urging a State legislature to vote for or against certain pending bills,
such a course is unusual. It had become a national question, however, and the President's energy
in handling the problem is worthy of praise.

According to the census of 1900, there were over 700,000 children under sixteen years of age
at work in the mills, mines, factories, and sweat-shops of the United States. Nearly all of
the States had child-labor laws, but they were ordinarily poorly enforced and no State was
wholly free from the blight of this child slavery. While fourteen years was the minimum in
most of the States, a few permitted the employment of children of ten years of age. In the
majority of cases there was no legal closing hour after which children might not be employed.

The subject was given national prominence through the Beveridge-Parsons Bill introduced into
the Senate, December, 1907, marking an epoch in the history of federal legislation. This bill
proposed to exclude from interstate commerce all products of mines and factories which employ
children under the age of fourteen. The bill was not, however, brought up for discussion. The
leading arguments of its opponents were as follows: (1) That the question was local only; (2)
there was no reason to believe that federal would be better than State administration; (3)
that it was limited in effect since it could not prevent children being employed in the manufacture
of goods to be sold within a State. A bill passed both houses and was signed by the President,
authorizing the Secretary of Commerce and Labor "to investigate and report on the industrial,
social, moral, educational, and physical conditions of woman and child workers of the United
States, wherever employed, with special reference to their age, hours of labor, term of employment,
health, illiteracy, sanitary and other conditions surrounding their occupation, and the means
employed for the protection of their health, persons, and morals." An appropriation of $150,000
was made with which to carry on this investigation. Among the demands of the National Child
Labor Committee have been a shorter day's work for children between the ages of fourteen and
sixteen, health certificates for factory employment in dangerous trades, and the regulation
of children in street trades.

The period of Mr. Roosevelt's administrations was notable on account of advances made in various
other directions. Electricity was applied to new and larger uses. Power was transmitted to
greater distances. Niagara Falls was made to produce an electric current employed leagues away.
Electric railways, radiating from cities, converted farms and sand-lots into suburban real
estate quickly and easily accessible from the great centres. Telephone service was extended
far into country parts, and, with the rural free delivery of mail, brought farmers into quick
and inexpensive communication with the outside world, robbing the farm of what was once both
its chief attraction and its greatest inconvenience--isolation.

Guglielmo Marconi and his wireless telegraph.

German experiments developed an electric surface car with a speed of two miles a minute. Wireless
telegraphy came into use. By means of high masts rigged, with wires diverging to the earth
somewhat like the frame of a partly opened umbrella, it was found possible under favorable
atmospheric conditions to telegraph hundreds of miles through the air. The most notable use
of this invention was to communicate between ships and the shore or between ships at sea, a
particularly desirable facility in fog, storm, or darkness, when other signals were useless.
Bicycles somewhat passed from vogue, but automobiles became fashionable, partly for rapid transit,
partly for work formerly consigned to heavy teams. Auto-carriages capable of railway speed,
varying indefinitely in style and in cost, might be seen upon the smoother roads about cities
all the way from Maine to California. They exerted great influence in inducing communities
to macadamize roads, for which the passing of the stage-coach and the spread of railroads had
diminished the demand.

Effort with flying machines was incessant but only partially successful. No air-ship had thus
far been devised which could undertake a definite voyage of length with any certainty of reaching
its destination. The best feat yet was that of the air-ship Arrow, which, October 25, 1904,
at St. Louis, made a ten-mile trip. On the other hand, the development of boats able to carry
life for hours beneath the surface of the sea added a new form of attack and defence against
the well-nigh impenetrable sides and enormously powerful guns of modern naval ships.

About 1890 the use of the Australian ballot system became general, and thus the purchase of
votes became more difficult. But this reform did not eliminate the evils of machine politics.
State laws were extended to the control of party affairs, with severer punishments for corrupt
practices, the control of lobbying, and the requirement of publicity for campaign expenses.
In a few States the primary election system was put into operation. Public officers won popular
approval in numerous States and cities by their activity in revealing "graft" and by their
fearless enforcement of the law.

These reforms were made possible by the increase of independent voting in State and city politics.
Politicians must reckon, as never before, with the demand of the average citizen for honesty
in public service. The influence of corporations in governmental affairs received a check,
and there came to be a growing demand for the more complete control of public utilities, and
for the public ownership of them in cities.

The prominence of the moral element in the business and political reforms mentioned above characterizes
this as an era of "awakened civic conscience." Both moral and economic considerations may be
seen in the protest against the excessive use of alcoholic liquors that has resulted in the
prohibition of liquor selling in a number of States and parts of States, especially in the
South. Educationally, the period showed increased attention to the industrial and practical
aspects of school work. Courses in manual training came to be regarded as necessary for the
complete development of mind and body. Physical education received greater attention. The establishment
of public libraries, aided by the munificent gifts of Andrew Carnegie, was rapid.

Millions of dollars, also, were contributed to the cause of education and research. Among the
most notable of these gifts were those by Mr. Carnegie for the establishment of the Carnegie
Institution and the Carnegie Foundation, and the contribution to the General Education Board
by John D. Rockefeller. In 1902 the Carnegie Institution at Washington was established by a
gift of $10,000,000 by Andrew Carnegie. This sum he afterward increased to $25,000,000. The
work of the institution is to carry on scientific study and research. Material is being collected
for the economic history of the United States, and students of American history have been aided
by the catalogues showing the location of documentary and other source material. While the
head-quarters of the Institution is in Washington, important departments are located elsewhere
throughout the country. There is a laboratory at Tucson, Arizona, for the study of desert plant
life; a biological laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island; a marine biological laboratory
at Tortugas, off the Florida coast, and an astronomical observatory at Mount Wilson, California.

May 6, 1905, the announcement was made of a gift of $10,000,000 for the purpose of providing
retiring pensions for the teachers of colleges, universities, and technical schools in the
United States, Canada, and Newfoundland. In making the gift Mr. Carnegie wrote: "I hope this
fund may do much for the cause of higher education and to remove a source of deep and constant
anxiety to the poorest paid and yet one of the highest of all professions." The fund was to
be applied without regard to age, sex, creed, or color. Sectarian institutions, so-called,
or those which require a majority of their trustees, officers, faculty, or students to belong
to a specified sect, or which impose any theological test whatever, were excluded by the terms
of the gift. Universities supported by State taxation were at first excluded, but a supplementary
gift by Mr. Carnegie of $5,000,000, in 1908, extended the privileges of the foundation to these
universities.

In February, 1907, John D. Rockefeller increased the money at the disposal of the General Education
Board by a gift of $32,000,000. This fund, which had been originally established by him, amounting
to $11,000,000, had been used chiefly for the improvement of education in the South. Common
schools were aided, high-schools established, and instruction in agriculture fostered. The
additional sum was to be devoted to lending assistance to certain selected colleges, with the
stipulation that the college was to raise three times the amount of money granted it by the Board.

CHAPTER XIV

THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1908

[1908]

In spite of the oft-repeated statement made by President Roosevelt that he would not be a candidate
for nomination on the Republican national ticket in 1908, the party leaders seemed to fear
a stampede in the Chicago convention. Plans had been laid carefully by the party leaders to
prevent this possibility, and when William H. Taft, of Ohio, received the nomination on the
first ballot, delegates and spectators gave vent to their feelings by prolonged applause. Out
of a total of 980 ballots cast Mr. Taft received 702. As Secretary of War in President Roosevelt's
cabinet he had been chosen by the President to succeed him, for it was believed that through
training and sympathy he was best fitted to carry out the policies of the administration.

Other candidates for nomination had appeared during the summer and each had a following of
more or less strength. Senator La Follette, of Wisconsin; Governor Hughes, of New York, and
Speaker Cannon, of Illinois, each received some support in the convention. Throughout the land
no surprise was occasioned, however, by the nomination of Mr. Taft. Apparently the nomination
of James S. Sherman, of New York, for the office of Vice-President was the result of political
expediency; he was a good organization man; he had enjoyed considerable experience in public
affairs and had been a member of Congress for twenty years. Moreover, the fact that he came
from New York made it a wise move, politically, to give him a place on the ticket.

To outside observers the convention was a harmonious one, ready and anxious to adopt and indorse
the Roosevelt policies and to accord a most hearty support to the candidate who best represented
these policies. The platform which was drawn up was a strong political document which not only
stated the Republican policies clearly but was also a piece of campaign literature of some
note from the stand-point of literary worth.

Photograph by C. M. Ball, Washington. James S. Sherman, nominated for Vice-President.

Throughout the months preceding the assembling of the Democratic convention, in Denver, there
was some uncertainty as to who would control it. Governor Folk, of Missouri, had been much
in the public eye through his war on graft and on account of his successful administration
of the gubernatorial office. Judge Gray, of Delaware, who had served his State in the United
States Senate and had acquired an enviable reputation as a justice of the United States Circuit
Court, was also a strong candidate. Judson Harmon, of Ohio, Attorney-General under President
Cleveland, and Governor Johnson, of Minnesota, had numerous supporters.

When the voting began in the convention the result was not long in doubt. William Jennings
Bryan was for the third time accorded the honor of leading the Democratic party. On the first
ballot Mr. Bryan received 892-1/2 votes; Judge Gray, his chief opponent, received 59-1/2. The
cheers which followed the announcement of the vote showed that two defeats had not dampened
the loyalty of the Western Democrats. Mr. Kern, of Indiana, was nominated by acclamation for
the Vice-Presidency. The committee on the formation of the platform seemed to have some difficulty
in determining the final form of some of the planks.

Both parties in their platforms favored tariff revision. The Republican party declared for
the protective system and reciprocity and promised a special session of Congress to treat the
whole tariff question. The Democratic party adhered to the old principle of "tariff for revenue"
and pledged itself to return to that basis as soon as practicable. Furthermore, it pledged
itself to bring about immediately such reductions as would put trust-controlled products upon
the free list and to lower the duties on the necessaries of life, particularly upon those which
were sold more cheaply abroad than at home. Lumber was to go on the free list. Any deficiency
in the revenues which might arise from this policy was to be made up through the medium of
an income tax.

Both platforms declared for reform in the currency laws, but neither one advanced any plan
for revision. The Democratic platform condemned as criminal the large expenditures of the recent
administration, but showed some inconsistency by favoring such policies as a large navy, generous
pensions, large expenditures for the improvement of rivers and harbors which would necessitate
the expenditure of great sums.

The regulation of railways and corporations was demanded by both parties. The difference between
the demands lay in the means to be employed. The Democratic platform declared for State control
of this question as well as that relating to the conservation of our natural resources. The
Republicans took the stand that both questions should be solved by the Federal Government.

In treating the problem of the alien races the Republican document referred to the negro race
by name, demanded equal justice for all men, and condemned the devices used by some States
for disfranchising the negro. Nothing was said concerning Chinese and Japanese immigration.
The Democratic platform was silent on the negro question and declared against the admission
of Orientals into our country.

Arbitration was favored by the Republicans, but was not mentioned in the opposition platform.
On the Philippine question there was a division. The Republicans favored a gradual development
of home-rule; the Democrats for early independence under an American protectorate.

Three things in the Democratic platform are worthy of note: (I) The demand for a federal law
compelling publicity of campaign contributions; (2) the election of senators by direct vote,
and (3) the adoption of such parliamentary rules as would make the House of Representatives
a deliberative body.

The Socialist convention, which assembled in Chicago, nominated Eugene V. Debs for President
and Ben Hanford for Vice-President.

Two tendencies of political thought were displayed in the Socialist platform as framed by the
committee. First, a tendency away from individual ownership of productive property and the
individual administration of industry, and toward the collective ownership of productive property
and the collective administration of industry. This was illustrated by the demands made for
the collective ownership of all railways, steamship lines, and other means of transportation,
as well as telephones, telegraphs, etc. It was further evidenced by the demand that the public
domain be made to include mines, quarries, oil wells, water-power, reclaimed and reforested
lands. The second tendency was away from a form of government of checks and balances toward
one by the unrestrained majority. This was shown by the demands for the abolition of (I) the
Senate, (2) the veto power of the President, (3) the power of the Supreme Court to pass on
the constitutionality of legislation.

Industrial demands were made. There should be a more effective inspection of workshops and
factories; there should be no employment of children under sixteen years of age; interstate
transportation of the products of child labor or convict labor should be forbidden; compulsory
insurance against unemployment, illness, accidents, old age, and death should be adopted.

Among the political reforms demanded were inheritance and income taxes, equal suffrage for
men and women, the initiative and referendum, proportional representation, and the right of
recall. The Federal Constitution was to be amended by majority vote. Judges were to be elected
for short terms.

The nominees of the Prohibition party were Eugene W. Chapin, of Illinois, for President, and
Aaron S. Watkins, of Ohio, for Vice-President. In the platform framed there were the usual
declarations against the liquor traffic, but there were also planks demanding reforms.  The
election of senators by direct vote; the passage of inheritance and income taxes; the establishment
of postal savings banks; the guaranty of bank deposits; the creation of a permanent tariff
commission; the conservation of natural resources; an equitable and constitutional employers'
liability act, and legislation basing suffrage only upon intelligence and ability to read and
write the English language, were the chief planks. Beyond any doubt this platform--the shortest
of all--shows that the men who constructed it were not dreamers. It is possible that the delegates
may have been looked upon as visionaries, for there were few among them who could be called
"practical politicians," but, as one writer of note has said, the delegates were "typical of
that class of society on which the nation ever depends in a great crisis, the sort from which
all moral movements spring. . . ."

It has often been said that the excitement of presidential campaigns is detrimental to the
nation. This could hardly be said of the campaign of 1908. To produce political excitement
there must be debatable questions termed, by the politicians as "issues." Just what the issues
were in the campaign few people could determine. There were no issues which involved foreign
affairs. The Democratic party did not criticise the sending of the fleet around the world,
the administration's policy in Cuba, the policy concerning the Panama Canal, nor even the policy
pursued in the Philippines. As regards military and naval matters, pensions to veterans, the
development of internal waterways, the conservation of resources, etc., there were no issues
simply because the people had practically the same views about them. Consequently issues had
to be made, and, generally speaking, the Republican leaders appealed to the people along the
lines of the personal fitness of the candidates.

It was pointed out that President Roosevelt had indicated his Secretary of War as the best
man to carry out the policy inaugurated by the administration of subduing and controlling influential
law-breakers. The chief officer of the government has vested in himself powers of wide range--the
appointment of the judiciary, the superintendence of the administration of the business affairs
of the nation, the guidance of our international affairs. Therefore the President must be a
keen judge of men capable of distinguishing the honest, efficient servant of the nation from
the self-seeking politician; he must resist political pressure; he must be national in his
patriotism and breadth of vision; he must know our foreign relations intimately, that the continuity
of policies may not be broken and the efficiency of our foreign service weakened thereby. He
must have the capacity to work long hours, with skill, care, and rapidity. In short, the chief
executive must be a man who is fit mentally and physically.

Some of these essential qualities the candidates of the two great parties possessed in a high
degree. They were honest and sincere; they were familiar with the desires and needs of the
various sections of the nation; they were national in the breadth of their policies. But they
were different in temperament, equipment, and experience, and upon this difference the Republican
leaders made their appeal to the voters.

The Democratic nominee was essentially an orator--he swayed the masses by his denunciation
of the perils which threatened the nation through the concentration of wealth which had gone
on under the Republican rule. His opponents admitted that a man of his stamp was invaluable
to the American people, but they contended that his place was in the editor's chair, in the
pulpit, or upon the lecture platform, not as the chief executive of the nation. Furthermore,
it was said that this great orator had views on political, social, and economic questions which
bordered on the visionary, and that any man who had openly supported free silver, anti-imperialism,
or even the guaranty of bank deposits, could not be safely trusted with the guidance of the
nation's destinies.

The Republican candidate had none of the qualifications of an orator; he was rather a teacher.
He did not cater to the desires of his audience; he struck at the abuses most prevalent in
the section where he spoke. It was his business to point out weaknesses; to find remedies for
them; to educate, not sway, his audiences. His mind was constructive; his training had been
along the lines of constructive political thought; he had proven his ability by his organization
of a civil government for the Philippines and by his solution of the vexed question of Cuba.
So it was argued that the best test of his ability and guaranty of efficiency was the work
he had already done.

The campaign was lacking in life and enthusiasm simply because there were no clearly defined
issues. The candidates went through the usual performances of "swinging around the political
circuit." Mr. Taft was accorded a warm welcome on his trip, for the people wished to get acquainted
with President Roosevelt's choice as much as to hear him discuss the Republican policies. Mr.
Bryan, who conducted a great speaking campaign, confined his attention to advocating the bank
guaranty plan and to attacking the evils of private monopoly. Political enthusiasm was at a
low ebb. Few people took matters seriously and the campaign was aptly characterized as the
"Era of No Feeling."

The vote cast for presidential electors was primarily an expression of popular confidence in
the Roosevelt administration. For nearly half a century the situation in the nation had been
becoming more and more a source of anxiety to the thinking men of the land. Our economic development
had taken place so rapidly that the great aggregations of capital and the great corporations
had gotten beyond control and had shown dangerous tendencies toward lawlessness and political
corruption. The feeling that the great corporations were not only beyond the control of law
but even controlled the government in the interests of a few, led to a belief that the government
was passing out of the hands of the people, and that the function of our republican government
was being arrested. The radical and the agitator were getting the ear of the nation, for the
faith of the nation was shaken. Then came President Roosevelt to take up a task of greatest
difficulty, and for nearly eight years, amidst the applause of the plain people, he administered
the affairs of the nation firmly, honestly, and with efficiency. The Republican convention
in Chicago by its nomination of Mr. Taft had put the stamp of its approval upon the Roosevelt
administration, and turned to appeal to the voters.

Copyright, 1908,  by Young & Carl, Cincinnati, Ohio.

In round numbers Taft received 7,680,000 votes and Bryan 6,410,000. The electoral vote stood
321 for the Republican candidate and 162 for the Democratic candidate. Thirty States elected
Republican presidential electors; eighteen elected Democratic electors. With the exception
of Nebraska, Nevada, and Colorado, which together contributed sixteen electoral votes, all
the States carried by the Democratic nominee were Southern States. The nation had approved
the Roosevelt policy, but the great popular vote for Mr. Bryan showed clearly the loyalty of
millions of voters. These men believed that their leader stood for the plain people--for the
unprivileged. There were many who had feared Mr. Bryan's policies in 1896, who voted for him
in 1908 because they believed that twelve years of public life and the study of national problems
had changed and bettered his ideals.

Some Republican writers professed to believe that the popular vote indicated that a majority
of people adhered to the policy of protection. To others it appeared that the voters were willing
to accept the protective policy with a promise for honest tariff revision in order to obtain
a continuation of the Roosevelt policies.

The popular vote is interesting mainly for what it showed concerning the changed strength of
the small parties, During the period 1904 to 1908 the drift had evidently been away from them.
The Socialist vote was nearly as large in 1908 as in 1904, which was a consolation to Socialists,
for they had held the ground gained by the heavy vote in 1904. The Prohibition vote fell off
about ten per cent from that polled in 1904 and the Independence party polled only 82,000 votes.

In the House of Representatives the Sixty-first Congress had 219 Republicans and 172 Democrats;
the Senate 60 Republicans and 32 Democrats.

CHAPTER XV

THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT

[1909]

On March 4, 1909, the date of the inaugural ceremonies, Washington was visited by a heavy snow-storm,
and Mr. Taft, departing from the custom of delivering his inaugural address at the east end
of the Capitol, spoke in the Senate chamber. Many trains bearing visitors to Washington, from
various parts of' the country, were blockaded, This condition served to emphasize the call,
many times made, for the transfer of the date of these services to April 30, the day on which
President Washington took the oath of office.

President Taft's inaugural address was wise and temperate and satisfactory to the country at
large. He asserted that the most important feature of his administration would be the maintenance
and enforcement of the reforms inaugurated by President Roosevelt. He justified appropriations,
as his predecessor had done, for maintaining a suitable army and navy; advocated the conservation
of our natural resources, the establishment of postal savings banks, and direct lines of steamers
between North and South America.

The cabinet was made up of men largely gathered from private life, a majority of them being
comparatively unknown to the public. Philander C. Knox was United States senator from Pennsylvania
when he was appointed Secretary of State. He had served as Attorney-General in President McKinley's
cabinet. Franklin MacVeagh, of Illinois, who was made Secretary of the Treasury, had been prominent
as a merchant in Chicago and active in public affairs. Mr. MacVeagh and Jacob M. Dickinson,
who became Secretary of War, were both members of the Democratic party. By inviting Democrats
to become members of his political family, President Taft desired to give recognition to the
fact that he had been elected by Democratic votes and had received substantial support in parts
of the South. Mr. Dickinson was also from Chicago. The Secretary of the Navy, George von L.
Meyer, of Massachusetts, had served as ambassador to Russia, and later as Postmaster-General
during Mr. Roosevelt's administration. Frank H. Hitchcock, of Ohio, who was made Postmaster-General,
had served as First Assistant Postmaster-General. George W. Wickersham, an attorney of good
standing in New York City, was appointed Attorney-General. Richard A. Ballinger, of Seattle,
who had been Commissioner of the General Land Office, 1907-1909, was appointed Secretary of
the Interior. James Wilson, of Iowa, who had served as Secretary of Agriculture since 1897,
was continued in that office. Charles Nagel, a noted lawyer of St. Louis, was made Secretary
of Commerce and Labor.

With the beginning of the new administration the President's salary was increased to $75,000
a year; that of the Vice-President to $12,000; and members of the cabinet to $12,000.

From June 1 to October 15 there was held at Seattle the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. The
rapid growth of Seattle has been due in no small degree to the fostering of trade with Alaska.
The exhibits served to demonstrate the wisdom of the purchase of the territory, which at that
time was characterized as Seward's "folly." Alaska has for some years been recognized as a
country of wealth and opportunity. The gold output each year is more than three times the sum
paid Russia for the territory. About one-fifth of the gold produced in the United States comes
from Alaskan mines. Products amounting to $33,500,000 were shipped to the States from Alaska
during the year 1907, and the return trade for that year amounted to $19,500,000. The value
of the fishery products is five-sevenths as great as the output of the gold mines. Alaskan
coal-fields are estimated to be even richer than her gold deposits. Other productions of the
territory are silver, tin, lead, quicksilver, graphite, marble, lumber, grains, vegetables,
and fruits.

The purpose of the exposition was declared to be "to exploit the resources and potentialities
of the Alaskan and Yukon territories; to make known and foster the vast importance of the trade
of the Pacific Ocean and of the countries bordering thereon, and to demonstrate the marvellous
progress of Western America." The energy and determination of the men of the new Northwest
was well shown in the preparation made for the exposition. No financial assistance was asked
from the federal government. The necessary $10,000,000 were contributed almost entirely in
Seattle and the State of Washington. One million dollars were expended by Seattle, as a preparatory
step, on her municipal improvements.

The site of the exposition was the campus of the State University, between Lakes Washington
and Union. From the grounds, notable for their natural beauty, were visible in the distance
Mount Rainier, the loftiest peak in the United States, the snow-covered Olympics to the west,
and the Cascade range to the east.

Three permanent buildings were erected by the State of Washington with the understanding that
they were afterward to be used by the university. Most of the structures followed the French
Renaissance design. In the forestry building, which was 320 feet long and 140 feet broad, and
built of logs in the rough, there were displayed the timber resources of Alaska and the Northwest.
An out-door farm illustrated the agricultural resources of the region. The Japanese exhibit
was second only in interest to that of Alaska. The exposition served to demonstrate, as it
was intended to do, the possibilities for the investment of capital in the Northwest and the
opportunities for those seeking new homes.

Beginning with September 25 and continuing throughout the first week of October, there was
a notable celebration in New York City, and in other cities on the Hudson, commemorative of
the discovery of that river by Henry Hudson three centuries before and the trip up the river
by Robert Fulton's steamboat in 1807. The leading feature of the pageant was the assembling
in the harbor of the largest fleet of international character ever brought together at one
time, and the cruise up the Hudson as far as Newburg of eighty war vessels selected from the
navies of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and other powers. These huge vessels
were in striking contrast to the two small ones which were given the place of honor in the
pageant, the replicas of the Half  Moon and the Clermont. The land parades were likewise spectacular
in their effects.

In October, 1909, Commander Robert E. Peary and Dr. Frederick A. Cook, two American travellers,
returned to the United States, both making claims to having discovered the north pole. The
accomplishment of this task, which had baffled so many arctic explorers, was hailed as a triumph
throughout the civilized world. Ardent supporters of each of these men began to champion the
right of their favorite to the great honor. It was shown that Commander Peary had for twenty-three
years been engaged in arctic exploration. His first voyage was made to Greenland in 1886, and
in his numerous expeditions to the frozen north since that time he had secured much scientific
data relating to the glaciology, geology, and ethnology of those regions.

Commander Peary's ship, The Roosevelt.

When Commander Peary left the Roosevelt, the ship which bore him as far north as navigation
permitted, on February 22, 1909, his expedition consisted of 8 white men, 59 Eskimos, 140 dogs,
and 23 sledges, with the necessary equipment for arctic travel. Upon returning to the United
States after overcoming the many dangers incident to such exploration, he submitted his records
to the National Geographical Society. A committee of that body, after passing upon these documents,
declared unanimously that it was their opinion that Peary had reached the north pole, April
6, 1909. This report further commended him for his organization and management of this expedition
and for his contributions to scientific knowledge.

Before his return to America, Dr. Cook had been hailed as the discoverer of the north pole
by European scientists, especially those of Denmark, who accepted his story of the accomplishment
of this task in April, 1908, one year earlier than the date of Peary's discovery. Many honors
were conferred upon him when he reached Copenhagen, September 4, 1909. He was met by the Crown
Prince of Denmark and the American minister, and by explorers, professors, and scientists from
various European countries. He was greatly honored also upon his return to New York City.

Commander Peary declared that the claims made by Dr. Cook were without foundation. His decision
was based on the evidence given by two Eskimos who had accompanied Dr. Cook, and who asserted
that the party went only a two days' journey north from Cape Hubbard and were never beyond
the land ice. Further evidence of deception by Dr. Cook was set forth by Edward M. Barrill,
who had accompanied him on his ascent of Mount McKinley in 1906. This guide declared that Dr.
Cook had not reached the summit of that mountain as claimed, but that the records had been
falsified. Later, a commission was appointed by the University of Copenhagen to examine the
notes and memoranda submitted to them by Dr. Cook. After a careful examination of these documents,
the commission reported that they found no evidence sufficient to warrant the belief that Dr.
Cook actually reached the north pole.

By vote of Congress, June 20, 1910, the territories of Arizona and New Mexico were granted
permission to form State constitutions. The constitutions which were framed in their conventions
and passed by majorities of the people contained some unusual provisions. The Arizona constitution
included the initiative, referendum, and recall of all elective officers, including judges.
The New Mexico constitution contains a referendum clause, but the clause providing for initiative
was rejected.

The constitution of Arizona was attacked in Congress and opposed by President Taft on account
of the provision for the recall of judges. The chief objection to the constitution of New Mexico
was the unsatisfactory method provided for its amendment. This constitution, however, was approved
by President Taft and by the House of Representatives, but the Senate failed to take any action.
In August, 1911, the President vetoed a joint resolution to admit the territories of New Mexico
and Arizona as States into the Union. He stated his attitude as follows: "The resolution admits
both territories to statehood with their constitutions on condition that at the time of the
election of State officers New Mexico shall submit to its electors an amendment to its new
constitution altering and modifying its provisions for future amendments, and on the further
condition that Arizona shall submit to its electors at the time of the election of its State
officers a proposed amendment to its constitution by which judicial officers shall be excepted
from the section permitting a recall of all elective officers. If I sign this joint resolution,
I do not see how I can escape responsibility for the judicial recall of the Arizona constitution.
The joint resolution admits Arizona with the judicial recall, but requires the submission of
the question of its wisdom to the voters. In other words, the resolution approves the admission
of Arizona with the judicial recall, unless the voters themselves repudiate it. . . . This
provision of the Arizona constitution in its application to county and State judges seems to
me pernicious in its effect, so destructive of independence in the judiciary, so likely to
subject the rights of the individual to the possible tyranny of a popular majority, and therefore
to be so injurious to the cause of free government that I must disapprove a constitution containing
it."

January 6, 1912, New Mexico, having complied with all conditions, was formally admitted into
the Union as the forty-seventh State.

Arizona, having an area of  113,000 square miles, was organized as a territory in 1863 and
appeared in the federal census reports for the first time in 1870 with a population of 9,658.
From 1870 to 1890 its growth in population was rapid, increasing a little more than four times
during the decade 1870-1880 and doubling during the succeeding ten years. The population in
1900 was 122,931 and in 1910 it was 204,354. During the last decade, therefore, the increase
in population has been 66.2 per cent, while the percentage of increase in the United States
as a whole has been only 21 per cent. According to the thirteenth census, Arizona contained
eight cities with an aggregate population of 58,414. The largest cities were Tucson, with a
population of 13,193, and Phoenix with 11,134.

Arizona produces more copper than any other State in the Union. Of the total copper ore mined
in the United States (1909) 27.7 per cent was from Arizona. There are also good mines of gold
and silver. Coal-mining, marble-quarrying, lumbering, raising cattle, sheep, and ostriches
are also important industries in Arizona. Through the efforts of the Reclamation service in
completing the Roosevelt Dam and a dam at Parker, and by the use of pumps, it is estimated
that 1,000,000 acres of fertile land will become available for cultivation. Other large areas
are also susceptible of irrigation.

In 1850 the territory of New Mexico was organized and in 1863 it was reduced to its present
limits with an area of 122,000 square miles. The population of New Mexico in 1900 was 195,310
and in 1910 was 327,301 an increase of 67.6 per cent. Albuquerque, with a population of 11,020,
and Rosewell with 6,172 were the two largest cities. Like Arizona, New Mexico possesses great
wealth in mines and forests, but the foundation for her future industrial progress lies in
her farms. In 1910 New Mexico possessed 500,000 acres of irrigated land. It was estimated that
3,000,000 acres more were amenable to artificial watering and the government is expending millions
of dollars on projects which will fertilize vast areas of this land.

During the year 1911 the world was astounded at the unparalleled exhibitions of the possibilities
of the aeroplane. The dream of centuries had been realized, and American genius was responsible
for the achievement. In 1896, a model machine which had been constructed under the direction
of Professor Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, driven by a one horse-power
steam-engine, made three flights of a mile each near Washington. Congress appropriated $50,000
for the construction of a complete machine, but after two unsuccessful attempts to fly, with
an operator, the project was abandoned.

Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville, bicycle manufacturers of Dayton, Ohio, did not share
in the general ridicule which followed this failure, and after three years of experimentation
demonstrated that the principles upon which Professor Langley had constructed his machine were,
in the main, sound. The first successful flight of a few seconds by one of their machines weighing
750 pounds was made in 1903. Two years afterward a flight of 24 miles was made at the rate
of 38 miles an hour. Other successful experiments followed, and the claim of the Wrights to
be considered the inventors of the first successful man-carrying flying machine was established.
French inventors at about the same time were carrying on successful experiments with machines
similarly constructed. September 16, 1908, Wilbur Wright, at Le Mans, France, demonstrated
that his machine could remain in the air for over an hour and at the same time fly across country
at a high speed. In that year, also, Orville Wright, in a government test at Fort Myer, Virginia,
not only made flights lasting over an hour, but carried a companion with him. During July,
1909, a French aviator, Bleriot, flew across the English Channel, a distance of 32 miles. That
year, also, Orville Wright ascended to the height of 1,600 feet; with a passenger, made a record
flight of 1 hour, 12 minutes and 36 seconds; and flew across country with a companion for 10
miles at the rate of 42 miles an hour. Thus it was shown that a machine had at last been constructed
which would not only fly, but would remain in the air at the will of its pilot and subject
to his guidance.

[1911]

In the aviation meet at Los Angeles, January 10, 1910, Louis Paulhan, a Frenchman, established
the record of 4,000 feet for height and Glenn H. Curtiss with a passenger set a new world's
record of 55 miles.

Shortly afterward Curtiss demonstrated for the first time that it was possible for an aeroplane,
especially constructed, to rise from the surface of water, make a flight in the air, return
to the starting-point, and again alight on the water.

The great possibilities as well as the dangers connected with aviation were brought out in
the meet at Chicago during August, 1911, where two aviators lost their lives. C. P. Rodgers,
in a Wright machine, remained in the air twenty-six and one-half hours out of the possible
thirty-one and one-half hours. Lincoln Beachey set a new world's record by ascending 11,642
feet. This record was again surpassed within a month by Ronald G. Garros, a French aviator,
who ascended 13,943 feet. He continued his flight to New York, and in eleven days reached that
city. He had travelled 1,265 miles in the actual flying time of 28 hours. C. P. Rodgers eclipsed
all records for long-distance aeroplane flying by crossing the continent from Sheepshead Bay,
New York, to Pasadena, Cal., a distance of 4,231 miles. He accomplished this feat in the total
time of 49 days, September 17 to November 5, 1911. His actual flying time was 82 hours.

These flights served to demonstrate that the permanent triumphs of aeronautics are to be won
by steadiness and efficiency and not by recklessness.

Among the significant legislation of the Sixty-second Congress, the passing of the "publicity
law," August, 1911, is deserving of especial commendation. The Democratic platform, 1908, demanded
publicity of campaign contributions, and Mr. Bryan announced that no funds would be received
from corporations. According to a New York statute, all campaign receipts and expenditures
must be filed. The Republican campaign committee agreed to apply this law in the presidential
contest.

According to the federal Publicity law no candidate for member of the House of Representatives
may spend more than $5,000 in his campaign for nomination or election, and no candidate for
United States senator may spend, legally, more than $10,000 in his campaign, Candidates are
prohibited from making promises of office or other promises in order to obtain votes, and no
candidate for senator may aid in the election of members of the legislature that is to fill
a senatorial vacancy. At the time, two United States senators were under indictment for the
purchase of their seats, and one of them acknowledged that he had expended nearly $100,000
in his primary campaign.

In partial fulfilment of the declaration that his policy was to bring about legislation for
the benefit of the whole country, President Taft in his message to Congress, December, 1911,
asked that the appointment of local federal officers throughout the country should be placed
under the classified service.

President Taft took an advance position also in his advocacy of the substitution of the appeal
to reason for the appeal to force in the settlement of all international difficulties. The
treaties of arbitration which were agreed upon during the summer of 1911 between Secretary
Knox and the representatives of Great Britain and France illustrate the general type of treaty
which the President hoped would be negotiated with other nations. Heretofore, the treaties
to which the United States has been a party have accepted as suitable for arbitration all questions
save those which concerned "vital interests and national honor." It was a great step forward,
therefore, when the agreement was reached between the powers that all disputes that are justiciable
and cannot be settled by diplomacy are to be submitted to arbitration.

In case of a difference on whether the dispute were justiciable or not, it was to be submitted
to a commission of inquiry for decision. If the commission found it was justiciable the question
in dispute must be submitted to arbitration. Should the commission find it was not justiciable
there would still exist the possibility of war. But either nation has the power to delay the
findings a year during which time diplomatic action may be resumed. The arguments against the
ratification of these facts in the Senate were based on the plea that they provided for compulsory
arbitration and thus tended to deprive the Senate of its constitutional prerogative. The wording
was so greatly modified in the Senate that the form of treaty which was finally ratified differed
but little from the arbitration treaties of 1908.

CHAPTER XVI

THE THIRTEENTH CENSUS, 1910

[1910-1911]

After many years of urging on the part of statisticians and public men, Congress, in 1902,
passed a bill which was signed by the President providing for a permanent census bureau connected
with the Department of Commerce and Labor. This bureau, as shown in the taking of the thirteenth
census, serves to promote both efficiency and economy in the collection of statistics associated
with the census work. Heretofore the Director of the Census had enormous patronage at his disposal
which he farmed out among congressmen and other political leaders.

E. Dana Durand, a trained statistician of wide experience, was appointed Director of the Census.
He announced that so far as possible the 65,000 enumerators would be selected under civil service
rules and for supervisors of the census he selected men on the basis of their special fitness
for the work. President Taft was in complete agreement with this programme and insisted that
local enumerators were to be appointed for the purpose of getting the work properly done and
not to assist any would-be dispensers of local patronage.

On April 15 the enumerators began their work of gathering statistics. The usual inquiries were
made on population, mortality, agriculture, manufactures, etc. Prior to April 15, an advance
schedule was sent to practically every farmer in the country, and he was asked to fill it out
before the coming of the enumerator. Similarly, in the cities, the enumerators distributed
advance population schedules which the head of the family was requested to fill out before
the official visit of the enumerator. In taking the thirteenth census, greater attention was
given than ever before to perfecting the schedules and weighing each question with regard to
its precise significance and scientific value. To that end a group of trained investigators,
familiar with the various topics which the census would cover, spent several months on a preliminary
study of the character of these questions. In addition to the nationality of each person as
determined by the mother tongue of the foreign-born inhabitants, additional inquiries were
made relative to the industry in which each person was employed and whether the person was
out of work on April 15.

Population schedules in the cities and large towns were required to be completed within two
weeks and in the rural districts within thirty days. The enormous labor of tabulating and classifying
these answers was then begun by the 3,500 clerks in the Census Office at Washington. Much of
this labor was performed by machines each capable of making 25,000 tabulations a day. Results
of the first tabulation of the population in the cities were made known about June 1 and the
count of the principal cities was completed by April 15. During September the population of
the entire country was made known. Within two years the leading facts in the census were compiled
and published as special bulletins. The entire cost of the census was about $13,000,000.

The total population of the United States, including our territorial possessions and dependencies,
was found to be about 101,000,000, thus for the first time passing the hundred million mark.
The population of the United States proper was 91,972,266; of Alaska, 64,356; Porto Rico, 1,118,012;
Hawaii. 191,909; Guam and Samoa, 15,100; the Philippine Islands about 7,700,000. These numbers
indicate an increase in the population of continental United States of 21 per cent in the decade,
or a slightly larger growth than the 20.7 per cent made during the preceding ten years.

One of the striking facts brought out in the census is the absolute decline in the percentage
of population compared with the previous decade in a number of the States of the East, South,
and Middle West, and an increase of this percentage in the other States, especially among those
of the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast. The percentage of total increase of population
in Alabama was 16.9 and the increase, according to the twelfth census, was 20.8; in Illinois,
16.9 as against 26 for the preceding census; Indiana, 7.3 against 14.8; Kentucky, 6.6 against
15.5; Massachusetts, 20 against 25.3; Minnesota, 18.5 against 33.7; Texas, 27.8 against 36.4;
Montana, 54.5 against 70. Iowa showed an actual loss of three-tenths per cent of her inhabitants,
while according to the preceding census there was a gain of 16.7 per cent in that State. In
the following States the gains in percentages were as follows: North Dakota, 80.8 against 67.1
for 1900; South Dakota, 45.4 and 15.2; Kansas, 15 and 3; Nebraska, 11.8 and 0.3; Colorado,
48 and 30.6; Oklahoma, 109.7; Utah, 34.9 and 31.3; Nevada, 93.4 and 10.6; Idaho, 101.3 and
82.7; Washington, 120.4 and 45; Oregon, 62.7 and 30.2, and California, 60.1 and 22.4.

In numerical advance, New York, Pennsylvania, California, Texas, and Illinois led. The increase
in New York was nearly 2,000,000, in Pennsylvania over 1,000,000, and in the other three States
nearly 900,000 each.

Another notable fact brought out by the thirteenth census was that the growth of the cities
was greater than during the preceding ten years. The rate of growth of the medium-sized cities
was more rapid than that of the large cities. This was not the case during the preceding decade.
Of the total population of continental United States, 46.3 per cent were urban. That is, 42,623,383
of the inhabitants resided in cities and towns having a population of 2,500 or more. The same
territory in 1900 and 1890, similarly classified as urban, contained 40.5 and 36.1 per cent,
respectively, of the total population of the country. In all but two States, Montana and Wyoming,
the urban population has increased faster than the rural population. The increase, since 1900,
in the population living in urban territory was 11,035,841 or 34.9 per cent, while the increase
in population living in rural territory during the same period was 4,941,850 or 11.1 per cent.
For the United States as a whole, therefore, the rate of increase for the population of urban
areas was three times that for the population living in rural territory. In the States of the
east north-central division, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, the urban
gain was 31.2 per cent, but there was a decrease in rural population of 0.2 per cent. The urban
increase of Illinois was 31.2 per cent, but the rural territory of the State showed a loss
of 7.5 per cent. The rural loss in Indiana was 5.5 per cent, and in Ohio 1.3 per cent. Michigan's
rural gain was 2 per cent and Wisconsin's 5.7. per cent. There were fourteen States in which
more than one-half of the population in 1910 were living in urban territory. Among these States
were Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut with nine-tenths of their population urban;
Illinois with 62 per cent, and Ohio with 56 per cent.

CENTER OF POPULATION AT EACH CENSUS 1790 TO 1910. MEDIAN POINT 1880 TO 1910.

The rapid growth of our industrial and manufacturing interests during the past quarter of a
century is shown by the fact that 22 per cent of the people of the country are massed in cities
of 100,000 inhabitants and over. In the three largest cities alone--New York, Chicago, and
Philadelphia--there are almost one-tenth the population of the whole country. There were five
cities with populations between 500,000 and 1,000,000; eleven between 250,000 and 500,000;
31 between 100,000 and 250,000; 59 between 50,000 and 100,000; 120 between 25,000 and 50,000;
374 between 10,000 and 20,000; 629 between 5,000 and 10,000, and 1,173 between 2,500 and 5,000.

The thirteenth census revealed but slight change in the location of the centre of population.
In computing its position, no account of the population of Alaska and of our insular possessions
was taken into consideration. It had moved west about 39 miles and northward seven-tenths of
a mile and was located at Bloomington in southern Indiana. The westward movement from 1900
to 1910 was nearly three times as great as from 1890 to 1900, but was less than that for any
decade between 1840 and 1890. This advance of the centre of population toward the West was
due to the increase in the population of the Pacific Coast States. The large increase in the
population of New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and other States north of the thirty-ninth
parallel served as a balance to the increase in Texas, Oklahoma, and southern California.

During the past fifteen years there has been a steady migration from the rural portions of
the United States to the western provinces of Canada, not less than 650,000 immigrants having
crossed the border within that period. Most of them have become naturalized Canadians. It has
been estimated that these immigrants took with them, on an average, $1,000.

According to the congressional reapportionment act following the twelfth census, there were
to be 386 members in the House of Representatives or one representative to 194,182 of the population.
The House of Representatives actually contained. 391 members after the admission of Oklahoma.
By the census of 1910, several States were entitled to additional members, but in order that
no State should be reduced in the number of its representatives, the House of Representatives
passed a bill providing for an increase of 42 members. The new ratio of representation would
then be one representative to 211,877 inhabitants. Effort was made to prevent this increase,
for it was argued that the House had already become unwieldy, requiring great effort on the
part of members to make themselves heard. The bill failed to pass the Senate at the regular
session, but subsequently, at the special session, it became a law. Party lines were closely
drawn in the Senate, for, on account of this increase, the Republicans would probably gain
32 new congressmen and the Democrats only 10. By this reapportionment the northeastern part
of the country and the extreme western and southwestern portions gained in their representation.
New York gained six representatives; Pennsylvania, four; California and Oklahoma, three each;
Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington, and Texas each gained two, and sixteen other States each
gained one.

The number of farms, according to the thirteenth census, were 6,340,357 or an increase of about
10 per cent over the number reported in 1900. There was an increase of 63,000,000 acres devoted
to farming during the decade. About 60 per cent of the farms of the country were operated by
their owners and two-thirds of these farms were free from mortgages. Two million three hundred
and forty-nine thousand two hundred and fifty-four farms were worked by tenants and 57,398
were in charge of managers. The tenant system was shown to be far more common in the South
than at the North or West. In the south central group of States, which includes a large part
of the cotton area, the tenants numbered 1,024,265 and the owners 949,036. In the south Atlantic
States there were 591,478 owners and 118,678 tenants; in north Central States, 1,563,386 owners
and 644,493 tenants, and in the Western States, 309,057 owners and 52,164 tenants.

Our foreign commerce for the year 1910 amounted in the aggregate to about $3,500,000,000, or
over $1,250,000,000 more than in 1900. Our exports were valued at $2,000,000,000.

CHAPTER XVII

THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT

[1911]

From time to time it has been charged that "government by the people" has become fiction in
our country. Little had been done to remedy this condition until the opening of the last decade.
Trouble then came for the supporters of the regular political order, manifesting itself in
conventions and legislatures. Laws abolishing nominations by the convention method were passed
in some States; and publicity of campaign expenses was insisted upon in others. The movement
was widespread and arose from various causes, but generally tended toward a single end--a government
according to popular will. The Western States have been the centre of the more radical movement.

The Senate has always been considered as the stronghold of the most conservative element in
our country and has often been accused of being the stronghold of privilege. It is interesting
to note the success of the progressive or insurgent movement in this body.

Copyright by Harris & Ewing, Washington. Robert M. La Follette.

The first progressive, Robert M. La Follette, of Wisconsin, appeared in the United States Senate
in 1905. He had done much, as governor, to gain the confidence of the people of his own State,
and he was sent to Washington to carry his fight for reform into the national legislature.
Here his reception was not cordial. He was looked upon as a radical, possibly a visionary reformer,
but not exceedingly dangerous, for he was alone. He stood alone until the election of 1908,
when nine more progressives took their seats; in 1910 the number jumped to sixteen. Here a
change came which probably caused the conservatives in the Senate some worry. The tariff of
1909 had been passed by a Republican Congress. The results of the elections of 1910 made it
appear that the people were not convinced that this act was an honest redemption of the Republican
campaign promises, for in the Senate which assembled in April, 1911, there were twenty-nine
thorough-going progressives and five other members who were more progressive than conservative
in their views. They represented twenty-five States. Six of the thirty-four came from the South;
three came from the East, and the remaining twenty-five from the West. Of the conservatives
only eighteen came from the West.

The same changes may be found in the House of Representatives. These changes are not so important
as the change which must come in the sentiment of the federal judiciary. From 1901 to 1909
the Executive was in the control of the progressives and the President was able to get some
important laws passed by a reactionary Congress, but in some instances the courts annulled
these laws.

The appointment of justices of the district courts of the United States is to a degree influenced
by the senators in the district in which the appointment is to be made. When these senators
are conservative it is natural that the candidates recommended by them should be conservative
and should entertain no legal theories interfering with the exalted position of property rights.
Should the various States be represented by progressives, different recommendations will naturally
follow and probably an interpretation of the Constitution which will accord a new standing
to personal rights.

In the early part of 1911 the movement crystallized into a regular political organization which
called itself The National Progressive Republican League, with the following platform:

(1) direct primaries; (2) popular election of delegates to the national convention; (3) election
of senators by direct vote of the people; (4) initiative, referendum, and recall; (5) an effective
corrupt practices act.

These points were not new; most of them are incorporated into the body of law of the State
of Oregon. Most progressive Democrats as well as Republicans seem willing to support these
principles. In almost every State the movement for the direct primaries has met studied opposition.
The "practical politician" or the professional politician seems to hate to see the old convention
system of nominations go. There are many who object to the election of senators by direct vote,
claiming that the people are not capable of choosing wisely in such cases. The direct election
of delegates to the national conventions is no more than the prerogative now exercised by the
voter when he casts his vote for the presidential electors. To his mind it means that he is
voting for the candidates themselves. In the vote for delegates to the conventions the voter
is accorded the right to express his preference for men to be candidates. The corrupt practices
plank deserves commendation. It cannot be made too strong, for every attempt to do away with
the irregular, vicious methods used is a step toward good government.

The plank which arouses the greatest opposition is that which incorporates the initiative,
referendum, and recall. All three are devices to make the machinery of popular government more
directly respondent to the popular will. The "initiative" is a process by which laws are proposed
on the petition of a certain specified number of voters for action either by the legislature
or by the direct vote of the people through a referendum. The "referendum" allows a popular
vote upon acts passed by the legislature--that is, a bill passed by the legislature may not
become a law unless sanctioned by a popular vote, if a vote is called for by a specified number
of voters. The "recall" gives the voters an opportunity to relieve a man of his office if by
a regular vote it is demonstrated that such an officer has not performed the duties of his
office to the satisfaction of his constituents. These expedients are still in the experimental
stage, and it is doubtful whether they are so fraught with danger as their opponents seem to
believe or so efficacious as their adherents insist. Much of their success depends upon the
cases to which they are applied and upon the popular interest displayed. The Oregon experiments
apparently have been very successful.

The question of the "recall" is a serious one. In some municipalities--Los Angeles, for example--it
has operated well. How it will work in the national government, where it will affect the judiciary,
is a problem. The veto of the Statehood Bill (Arizona and New Mexico) on account of the presence
of the "recall" for judges in the constitution of Arizona shows that President Taft is a stout
opponent. It seems well that any such step should be taken with extreme caution.

The progressive senators were active in their opposition to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Bill of
1909. For a period of twelve years there had been no tariff legislation. The great industrial
changes which went on during that time made a revision of the Dingley Tariff imperative. Although
there has been a constant demand for revision, the tariff played no part in the campaigns of
1900 and 1904. The demand has become insistent, however, during recent years, and may be attributed
in part to the increased cost of living. This demand, made chiefly by the wage-earners and
salaried men, has been seconded from another quarter. The attitude of foreign nations toward
our goods has made it increasingly difficult for American manufacturers to dispose of their
surplus. Wages have risen; the price of raw material is higher, and both affect the manufacturer.
Foreign nations have refused to accept our high tariffs without retaliation, and this has made
the manufacturer insist that Congress revise the objectionable Dingley act.

The agitation took definite form during the session of 1907-8 when the National Manufacturers'
Association undertook to secure legislation designed to create a tariff commission composed
of experts whose business it should be to ascertain the facts concerning the condition of manufacturers
and the necessity of a new tariff. Pursuant to this the Beveridge Tariff Commission Bill was
introduced into the Senate, but the leaders of both houses--Cannon, Aldrich, Payne, and others--said
bluntly that it was bad politics to take the question up just before a presidential campaign,
and nothing was done. The demand grew more insistent, and the wary leaders learned in time
that it would be good politics at least to declare for tariff revision, and this was done by
Chairman Payne of the Ways and Means committee of the House. Just when the revision would come
was not stated--some time after election, provided the nation would return the Republicans
to power.

When the session closed Chairman Payne set on foot a series of investigations ostensibly to
gain information to be used in the coming revision. It is possible that this was also an attempt
to end the criticism aimed at the leaders who had opposed the appointment of a commission.
Both the Democratic and Republican platforms of 1908 promised tariff revision, but of course
in different ways. The Republican leaders said the policy of the party would be to fix the
duties at a point which would not only offset the higher cost of production in this country,
but would also guarantee to the manufacturers a fair profit. The election put the conservatives
of the Republican party in control of all branches of the government, and when the principal
committees of both houses of Congress fell under the control of men fully committed to the
dogma of protection, the chance for a revision downward seemed slight. A special session was
called soon after President Taft's inauguration, and the Payne Bill, which it was claimed aimed
to decrease duties and increase the revenue, passed the House by a vote of 217 to 161.

The Finance Committee of the Senate, to which the bill was referred when it reached the Senate,
instead of reporting it, reported a substitute measure--the Aldrich Bill. This the House refused
to accept and the usual conference committee was organized, out of which committee came the
compromise Payne-Aldrich Bill, destined to become law through the President's signature, August
5, 1909.

The debate in the Senate was a noteworthy one. The progressive senators of the Middle West,
led by Dolliver, of Iowa, and La Follette, of Wisconsin, fought the measure sturdily, but with
little success. "Jokers" slipped in here and there, and more than one critic has charged that
the Senate was less solicitous for the rights of the consumers than for the rights of the "interests."

Several schedules have come in for the most severe kind of criticism. In the cotton schedule
the increased rates laid upon certain classes of cotton goods seem to have been imposed for
the benefit of New England manufacturers. These rates affect articles used by every person
in the United States. Most of these articles are manufactured from raw material produced in
America, and the cost of manufacturing the staple articles is but slightly higher than in any
of the important competing countries. The average rate imposed by the Dingley Tariff, according
to the Bureau of Statistics, was 38 per cent on cotton cloth and similar rates on other cotton
goods. Since 1897 the "infant industries" have grown, and some have in recent years declared
dividends of 66 per cent per annum. The Payne-Aldrich Bill increased the average rate on cotton
goods from 44.84 per cent in the Dingley Tariff to 50.62 per cent. The increases are not so
much on the high-priced goods as on the cheaper grades.

In the case of the wool schedule the object of criticism has been the discrimination against
the carded woollen industry, which produces the poor man's cloth, in favor of the worsted industry.
This is due to the imposition of a uniform duty of eleven cents per pound on raw, unwashed
wool, by which the cheaper woollens are taxed as high as 500 per cent, and frequently amounts
to less than 25 per cent on the finer grades. Based on this system of duties is a graded scale
in which the rates rise in an inverse ratio with the value of the goods. Some duties have been
lowered, but the change has been slight. The schedule remains nearly the same, but the burden
has been shifted.

There are reductions--more, numerically, than increases--but the reductions are effectively
modified by shifted classifications.

One thinker of note has termed the "maximum and minimum" clause as "the highest practical joke
of the whole bill." Little has been said of this clause except in connection with the "minimum."
It must be remembered that there is also a "maximum," and it does not augur well for the consumer.
Suppose a foreign nation discriminates against our goods; we, acting on the "maximum" theory,
discriminate against theirs, and the result is that the consumer pays the value of the article
plus the amount of the tariff of discrimination, since it has ever been true that the limit
in price is the top of the tariff wall.

A noteworthy feature of the bill is the provision for the formation of a Tariff Board, composed
of experts, who shall conduct investigations with the view of evolving a scientific tariff.
The board has little power save that of advising the President in the application of the "maximum
and minimum" clause.

That the tariff has not been deemed an honest redemption of Republican campaign pledges is
shown by the recent elections. In the Sixty-first Congress there were 219 Republicans in the
House of Representatives and 172 Democrats; to the Sixty-second Congress there were returned
162 Republicans and 228 Democrats.

The Democrats at once began a revision of the tariff. Allied with the progressives in the Senate,
revisions of the wool and cotton schedules were brought about. The Farmers' Free List Bill,
which admitted free of duty agricultural implements, sewing-machines, boots, shoes, fence wire,
and other things useful to farmers, was passed as an offset to the Reciprocity Bill which was
deemed by some to be disadvantageous to them. The President vetoed all of these measures upon
the ground that, since the Tariff Board was to make its report within a very short time, it
would be wiser to defer action on the tariff until the report could be used.

The Reciprocity Bill, which met the approval of the President, provided that our markets should
be free to Canada's leading agricultural products, live-stock, fish, lumber, etc. Print paper
and wood pulp were also to be admitted as soon as the Canadian provincial governments should
withdraw the restrictions upon the exportation of these products. The duties on some other
products--iron are, for example--were to be reduced. Canada was asked to admit free our agricultural
products, live-stock, etc., and to reduce the duties on coal, agricultural implements, and
some other manufactured goods. The September elections in Canada, however, showed that the
reciprocity treaty was not acceptable, for the Conservative party, which was strongly opposed
to the plan, gained a decisive victory. The act as passed by Congress still remains law in
the United States, and stands as a constant invitation to our Canadian neighbors to join us
in developing commercial relations on the western continent.

What effect will this Progressive movement have upon party organization? As matters stand at
present there are in reality four parties within the bonds of the two old parties--(1) the
Conservative Republicans of the East; (2) the Conservative Democrats of the South; (3) the
Progressive Republicans of the West; (4) the Progressive Democrats of the West. Out of this
tangle it appears that either a new party will be formed by the combination of the Progressives
of both old parties, or this Progressive movement must gain control of one or the other of
these parties. Should the former  happen, we may see the peculiar alliance of New England and
the South.

President Taft, it is maintained by many of his supporters, is himself a Progressive, and they
point to his attitude toward the great questions of the hour. He urged, they say, reciprocity
with Canada; called for revision of the tariff in the light of facts and scientific tests;
proclaimed unlimited arbitration; advocated the conservation of our natural resources, income
taxation, extension of civil service reform, employers' liability, and economy in the administration
of governmental affairs.

In answer it is asserted that President Taft declared the Payne-Aldrich tariff law to be the
best ever passed upon the subject, and that his advisers and supporters in all of the congressional
contests over vital measures were the senators and representatives known as reactionaries or
standpatters.

[1912]

President Taft himself, a few months before the convening of the Republican convention called
to meet in Chicago, June 16, 1912, stated his honesty of intention in the following words:
"I am very grateful for the honors the people have given me. I do not affect to deny the satisfaction
I should feel if, after casting up the totals pro and con and striking a balance, they should
decide that my first term had been fruitful enough of good to warrant their enlisting me for
another. Any man would be proud of such a verdict. But I have not been willing, nor shall I
be, to purchase it at the sacrifice of my freedom to do my duty as I see it. My happiness is
not dependent on holding any office, and I shall go back to private life with no heartburnings
if the people, after an unprejudiced review of my administration, conclude that some one else
can serve them to their greater advantage."

One thing is certain: the idea of government by the people has come into our national politics
to stay. It now controls one-third of the votes in the Senate and has affected the laws of
two-thirds of the States. The end sought is good government responsible to popular rule. Through
this rule justice for all is sought; equality of opportunity in political and industrial life;
the safeguarding of the interests and well-being of all; and through this rule an honest attempt
is being made to establish a government which will render the best service for the community,
guaranteeing to each individual all his rights, but no more than his rights.

"Agreeably to the order of the day, the Congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole,
to take into their further consideration the Declaration; and, after some time, the president
resumed the chair, and Mr. Harrison reported that the committee have agreed to a Declaration,
which they desired him to report.

1. He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

2.

3.

4. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant
from the repository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance
with his measures.

11. He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our Legislatures.

12. He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.

13. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions,
and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation;

14. For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;

15.  For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;

17.  For imposing taxes on us without our consent;

18.  For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of a trial by jury;

19. For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;

20.

21.

22.

23. He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war
against us.
