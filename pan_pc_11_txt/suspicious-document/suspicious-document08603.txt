"Herb, Stand Back! Stand Well Back to Avoid Being Splashed!"

Half a Dozen Times a Night or Oftener He Travelled under Escort through the Room

Eating in Two or Three Languages

On my way home from overseas I spent many happy hours mapping out a campaign. To myself I said:
"The day I land is going to be a great day for some of the waiters and a hard day on some of
the cooks. Persons who happen to be near by when I am wrestling with my first ear of green
corn will think I am playing on a mouth organ. My behaviour in regard to hothouse asparagus
will be reminiscent of the best work of the late Bosco. In the matter of cantaloupes I rather
fancy I shall consume the first two on the half shell, or au naturel, as we veteran correspondents
say; but the third one will contain about as much vanilla ice cream as you could put in a derby
hat.

"And when, as I am turning over my second piece of fried chicken, with Virginia ham, if H.
Hoover should crawl out from under it, and, shaking the gravy out of his eyes, should lift
a warning hand, I shall say to him: 'Herb,' I shall say, 'Herb, stand back! Stand well back
to avoid being splashed, Herb. Please desist and do not bother me now, for I am busy. Kindly
remember that I am but just returned from over there and that for months and months past, as
I went to and fro across the face of the next hemisphere that you'll run into on the left of
you if you go just outside of Sandy Hook and take the first turn to the right, I have been
storing up a great, unsatisfied longing for the special dishes of my own, my native land. Don't
try, I pray you, to tell me a patriot can't do his bit and eat it too, for I know better.

"'Shortly I may be in a fitter frame of mind to listen to your admonitions touching on rationing
schemes; but not to-day, and possibly not to-morrow either, Herb. At this moment I consider
food regulations as having been made for slaves and perhaps for the run of other people; but
not for me. As a matter of fact, what you may have observed up until now has merely been my
preliminary attack--what you might call open warfare, with scouting operations. But when they
bring on the transverse section of watermelon I shall take these two trenching tools which
I now hold in my hands, and just naturally start digging in. I trust you may be hanging round
then; you'll certainly overhear something.'

"'Kindly pass the ice water. That's it. Thank you. Join me, won't you, in a brimming beaker?
It may interest you to know that I am now on my second carafe of this wholesome, delicious
and satisfying beverage. Where I have lately been, in certain parts of the adjacent continent,
there isn't any ice, and nobody by any chance ever drinks water. Nobody bathes in it either,
so far as I have been able to note. You'll doubtless be interested in hearing what they do
do with it over on that side. It took me months to find out.

"'Then finally, one night in a remote interior village, I went to an entertainment in a Y.M.C.A.
hut. A local magician came out on the platform; and after he had done some tricks with cards
and handkerchiefs which were so old that they were new all over again, he reached up under
the tails of his dress coat and hauled out a big glass globe that was slopping full of its
crystal-pure fluid contents, with a family of goldfish swimming round and round in it, as happy
as you please.

"'So then, all in a flash, the answer came and I knew the secret of what the provincials in
that section of Europe do with water. They loan it to magicians to keep goldfish in. But I
prefer to drink a little of it while I am eating and to eat a good deal while I am drinking
it; both of which, I may state, I am now doing to the best of my ability, and without let or
hindrance, Herb.'"

To be exactly correct about it, I began mapping out this campaign long before I took ship for
the homeward hike. The suggestion formed in my mind during those weeks I spent in London, when
the resident population first went on the food-card system. You had to have a meat card, I
think, to buy raw meat in a butcher shop, and you had to have another kind of meat card, I
know, to get cooked meat in a restaurant; and you had to have a friend who was a smuggler or
a hoarder to get an adequate supply of sugar under any circumstances. Before I left, every
one was carrying round a sheaf of cards. You didn't dare go fishing if you had mislaid your
worm card.

The resolution having formed, it budded and grew in my mind when I was up near the Front gallantly
exposing myself to the sort of table-d'hôte dinners that were available then in some of the
lesser towns immediately behind the firing lines; and it kept right on growing, so that by
the time I was ready to sail it was full sized. En route, I thought up an interchangeable answer
for two of the oldest conundrums of my childhood, one of them being: "Round as a biscuit, busy
as a bee; busiest thing you ever did see," and the other, "Opens like a barn door, shuts like
a trap; guess all day and you can't guess that." To many polite deed in expiration was declined; and
on door were wasted of Henry vii., six 1485, and did it lay again, over artist since of the ordination

 He wouldn't find these things prevailing to any noticeable extent
in his native island now. Even the kidney, the same being the thing for which an Englishman
mainly raises a sheep and which he always did know how to serve up better than any one else
on earth, somehow doesn't seem to be the kidney it once upon a time was when it had the proper
sorts of trimmings and sauces to go with it.

At this time England is no place for the epicure. In peacetime English cooks, as a rule, were
not what you would call versatile; their range, as it were, was limited. Once, seeking to be
blithesome and light of heart, I wrote an article in which I said there were only three dependable
vegetables on the average Englishman's everyday menu--boiled potatoes, boiled cabbage, and
a second helping of the boiled potatoes.

That was an error on my part; I was unintentionally guilty of the crime of underestimation.
I should have added a fourth to the list of stand-bys--to wit: the vegetable marrow. For some
reason, possibly because they are a stubborn and tenacious race, the English persist in looking
upon the vegetable marrow as an object designed for human consumption, which is altogether
the wrong view to take of it. As a foodstuff this article hasn't even the merit that attaches
to stringy celery. You do not derive much nourishment from stale celery, but eating at it polishes
the teeth and provides a healthful form of exercise that gives you an appetite for the rest
of the meal.

From the vegetable marrow you derive no nourishment, and certainly you derive no exercise;
for, being a soft, weak, spiritless thing, it offers no resistance whatever, and it looks a
good deal like a streak of solidified fog and tastes like the place where an indisposed carrot
spent the night. Next to our summer squash it is the feeblest imitation that ever masqueraded
in a skin and called itself a vegetable. Yet its friends over there seem to set much store by it.

Likewise the English cook has always gone in rather extensively for boiling things. When in
doubt she boiled. But it takes a lot of retouching to restore to a piece of boiled meat the
juicy essences that have been simmered and drenched out of it. Since the English people, with
such admirable English thoroughness, cut down on fats and oils and bacon garnishments, so that
the greases might be conserved for the fighting forces; and since they have so largely had
to do without imported spices and condiments, because the cargo spaces in the ships coming
in were needed for military essentials, the boiled dishes of England appear to have lost most
of their taste.

You can do a lot of browsing about at an English table these days and come away ostensibly
filled; but inside you there will be a persistent unsatisfied feeling, all the same, which
is partly due, no doubt, to the lack of sweetening and partly due to the lack of fats, but
due most of all, I think, to a natural disappointment in the results. In the old times a man
didn't feel that he had dined well in England unless for an hour or two afterward he had the
comfortable gorged sensation of a python full of pigeons.

I shall never forget the first meals I had on English soil, this latest trip. At the port where
we landed, in the early afternoon of a raw day, you could get tea if you cared for tea, which
I do not; but there was no sugar--only saccharine--to sweeten it with, and no rich cream, or
even skim milk, available with which to dilute it. The accompanying buns had a flat, dry, floury
taste, and the portions of butter served with them were very homoeopathic indeed as to size
and very oleomargarinish as to flavour.

Going up to London we rode in a train that was crowded and darkened. Brilliantly illuminated
trains scooting across country offered an excellent mark for the aim of hostile air raiders,
you know; so in each compartment the gloom was enhanced rather than dissipated by two tiny
pin points of a ghastly pale-blue gas flame. I do not know why there should have been two of
these lights, unless it was that the second one was added so that by its wan flickerings you
could see the first one, and vice versa.

 Not being an officer
but merely a civilian disguised in the habiliments of a military man, I, on the other hand,
was bound by no such limitations, but might go as far as I pleased. So it was decided that
I should order double portions of everything and surreptitiously share with him; for by now
we were hungry to the famishing point.

We had our minds set on a steak--a large thick steak served with onions, Desdemona style--that
is to say, smothered. It was a pretty thought, a passing fair conception--but a vain one.

"No steaks to-night, sir," said the waiter sorrowfully.

"All right, then," one of us said. "How about chops--fat juicy chops?"

"Oh, no, sir; no chops, sir," he told us.

"Well then, what have you in the line of red meats?"

He was desolated to be compelled to inform us that there were no red meats of any sort to be
had, but only sea foods. So we started in with oysters. Personally I have never cared deeply
for the European oyster. In size he is anæmic and puny as compared with his brethren of the
eastern coast of North America; and, moreover, chronically he is suffering from an acute attack
of brass poisoning. The only way by which a novice may distinguish a bad European oyster from
a good European oyster is by the fact that a bad one tastes slightly better than a good one
does. In my own experience I have found this to be the one infallible test.

We had oysters until both of us were full of verdigris, and I, for one, had a tang in my mouth
like an antique bronze jug; and then we proceeded to fish. We had fillets of sole, which tasted
as they looked--flat and a bit flabby. Subsequently I learned that this lack of savour in what
should be the most toothsome of all European fishes might be attributed to an insufficiency
of fat in the cooking; but at the moment I could only believe the trip up from Dover had given
the poor thing a touch of car sickness from which he had not recovered before he reached us.

After that we had lobsters, half-fare size, but charged for at the full adult rates. And, having
by now exhausted our capacity for sea foods, we wound up with an alleged dessert in the shape
of three drowned prunes apiece, the remains being partly immersed in a palish custardlike composition
that was slightly sour.

"Never mind," I said to my indignant stomach as we left the table--"Never mind! I shall make
it all up to you for this mistreatment at breakfast to-morrow morning. We shall rise early--you
and I--and with loud gurgling cries we shall leap headlong into one of those regular breakfasts
in which the people of this city and nation specialise so delightfully. Food regulators may
work their ruthless will upon the dinner trimmings, but none would dare to put so much as the
weight of one impious finger upon an Englishman's breakfast table to curtail its plenitude.
Why, next to Magna Charta, an Englishman's breakfast is his most sacred right."

This in confidence was what I whispered to my gastric juices. You see, being still in ignorance
of the full scope of the ration scheme in its application to the metropolitan district, and
my disheartening experience at the meal just concluded to the contrary notwithstanding, I had
my thoughts set upon rashers of crisp Wiltshire bacon, and broad segments of grilled York ham,
and fried soles, and lovely plump sausages bursting from their jackets, and devilled kidneys
paired off on a slice of toast, like Noah and his wife crossing the gangplank into the Ark.

Need I prolong the pain of my disclosures by longer withholding the distressing truth that
breakfast next morning was a failure too? To begin with, I couldn't get any of those lovely
crisp crescent rolls that accord so rhythmically with orange marmalade and strawberry jam.
I couldn't get hot buttered toast either, but only some thin hard slabs of war bread, which
seemingly had been dry-cured in a kiln. I could have but a very limited amount of sugar--a
mere pinch, in fact; and if I used it to tone up my coffee there would be none left for oatmeal
porridge. Moreover, this dab of sugar was to be my full day's allowance, it seemed. There was
no cream for the porridge either, but, instead, a small measure of skimmed milk so pale in
colour that it had the appearance of having been diluted with moonbeams.

Furthermore, I was informed that prior to nine-thirty I could have no meat of any sort, the
only exceptions to this cruel rule being kippered herrings and bloaters; and in strict confidence
the waiter warned me that, for some mysterious reason, neither the kippers nor the bloaters
seemed to be up to their oldtime mark of excellence just now. From the same source I gathered
that it would be highly inadvisable to order fried eggs, because of the lack of sufficient
fat in which to cook them. So, as a last resort, I ordered two eggs, soft-boiled. They were
served upended, English-fashion, in little individual cups, the theory being that in turn I
should neatly scalp the top off of each egg with my spoon and then scoop out the contents from
Nature's own container.

Now Englishmen are born with the faculty to perform this difficult achievement; they inherit
it. But I have known only one American who could perform the feat with neatness and despatch;
and, as he had devoted practically all his energies to mastering this difficult alien art,
he couldn't do much of anything else, and, except when eggs were being served in the original
packages, he was practically a total loss in society. He was a variation of the breed who devote
their lives to producing a perfect salad dressing; and you must know what sad affairs those
persons are when not engaged in following their lone talent. Take them off of salad dressings
and they are just naturally null and void.

In my crude and amateurish way I attacked those eggs, breaking into them, not with the finesse
the finished egg burglar would display, but more like a yeggman attacking a safe. I spilt a
good deal of the insides of those eggs down over their outsides, producing a most untidy effect;
and when I did succeed in excavating a spoonful I generally forgot to season it, or else it
was full of bits of shell. Altogether, the results were unsatisfactory and mussy. Rarely have
I eaten a breakfast which put so slight a subsequent strain upon my digestive processes.

Until noon I hung about, preoccupied and surcharged with inner yearnings. There were plenty
of things--important things, too, they were--that I should have been doing; but I couldn't
seem to fix my mind upon any subject except food. The stroke of midday found me briskly walking
into a certain restaurant on the Strand that for many decades has been internationally famous
for the quality and the unlimited quantity of its foods, and more particularly for its beef
and its mutton. If ever you visited London in peacetime you must remember the place I mean.

The carvers were middle-aged full-ported men, with fine ruddy complexions, and moustaches of
the Japanese weeping mulberry or mammoth droop variety. On signal one of them would come promptly
to you where you sat, he shoving ahead of him a great trencher on wheels, with a spirit lamp
blazing beneath the platter to keep its delectable burden properly hot. It might be that he
brought to you a noble haunch of venison or a splendid roast of pork or a vast leg of boiled
mutton; or, more likely yet, a huge joint of beef uprearing like a delectable island from a
sea of bubbling gravy, with an edging of mashed potatoes creaming up upon its outer reefs.

If, then, you enriched this person with a shilling, or even if you didn't, he would take in
his brawny right hand a knife with a blade a foot long, and with this knife he would cut off
from the joint a slice about the size and general dimensions of a horseshoer's apron. And if
you cared for a second slice, after finishing the first one, the carver felt complimented and
there was no extra charge for it. It was his delight to minister to you.

But, alas, on this day when I came with my appetite whetted by my sea voyage, and with an additional
edge put upon it by the privations I had undergone since landing, there was to be had no beef
at all! Of a sudden this establishment, lacking its roast beef, became to me as the tragedy
of Hamlet, the melancholy Dane, would be with Hamlet and Ophelia and her pa and the ghost and
the wicked queen, and both the gravediggers, all left out.

When I had seated myself one of the carvers came to me and, with an abased and apologetic air,
very different from his jaunty manner of yore, explained in a husky half whisper that I might
have jugged hare or I might have boiled codfish, or I might have one of the awful dishes. Anyhow,
that was what I understood him to say.

This last had an especially daunting sound, but I suppose I was in a morbid state, anyhow,
by now; and so I made further inquiry and ascertained from him that the restrictions applying
to the sale of meat did not apply to the more intimate organs of the butchered animal, such
as the liver and the heart, and, in the case of a cow, the tripe. But the English, with characteristic
bluntness, choose to call one of these in its cooked state an offal dish--pronounced as spelled
and frequently tasting as pronounced.

As one who had primed himself for a pound or so of the rib-roast section of a grass-fed steer,
I was not to be put off with one of the critter's spare parts, as it were. Nor did the thought
of codfish, and especially boiled codfish, appeal to me greatly. I have no settled antipathy
to the desiccated tissues of this worthy deep-sea voyager when made up into fish cakes. William. was

 Merely by glancing at the hors d'oeuvres served at luncheon in a medium-priced
café in Paris one can get a good general idea of what discriminating persons declined to eat
at dinner the night before.

The Parisian garbage collector must work by the day and not by the job. On a piecework contract
he would starve to death. And a third reason was that all through the country the peasants,
by request of the Government, were slaughtering their surplus beeves and sheep and swine, so
there might be more forage for the army horses and more grain available for the flour rations
of the soldiers.

In Paris the bread was indifferently poor. An individual was restricted to one medium-sized
roll of bread at a meal. Butter was not by any means abundant, and of sugar there was none
to be had at all unless the traveller had bethought him to slip a supply into the country with
him. The bulk of the milk supply was requisitioned for babies and invalids and disabled soldiers.
Cakes or pastries in any form were absolutely prohibited in the public eating places, and,
I think, in private homes as well. But of beef and mutton and veal and fowls, and the various
products of the humble but widely versatile pig, there was no end, provided you had the inclination
plus the price.

And so, though the lack of sugar in one's food gave one an almost constant craving for something
sweet--and incidentally insured a host of friends for anybody who came along with a box of
American candy under his arm or a few cakes of sweet chocolate in his pocket--one might take
his choice of a wide diversity of fare at any restaurant of the first or second class, and
keep well stayed.

In connection with the Paris restaurants I made a most interesting discovery, which was that
when France called up her available man power at the time of the great mobilisation, the military
heads somehow overlooked one group who, for their sins, should have been sent up where bullets
and Huns were thickest. The slum gave up its Apache--and a magnificent fighter he is said to
have made too! And the piratical cab drivers who formerly infested the boulevards must have
answered the summons almost to a man, because only a few of them are left nowadays, and they
mainly wear markings to prove they have served in the ranks; but by a most reprehensible error
of somebody in authority the typical head waiters of the cafés were spared. I base this assertion
upon the fact that all of them appeared to be on duty at the time of my latest visit. If there
was a single absentee from the ranks I failed to miss him.

There they were, the same hawk-eyed banditti crew that one was constantly encountering in the
old days; and up to all the same old tricks too--such as adding the date of the month and all
the figures of the year into the bill; and such as invariably recommending the most expensive
dishes to foreigners; and such as coming to one and bending over one and smiling upon one and
murmuring to one: "An' wot will ze gentailman 'ave to-day?"--and then, before the gentailman
can answer, jumping right in and telling him what he is going to have, always favouring at
least three different kinds of meats for even the lightest meal, and never less than two vegetables,
and never once failing to recommend a full bottle of the costliest wine on the premises.

Stress of war had not caused these gentry to forget or forgo a single one of the ancient wiles
that for half a century their kind has practised upon American tourists and others who didn't
care what else they did with their money so long as they were given a chance to spend it for
something they didn't particularly want. Yep; those charged with the responsibility of calling
up the reserves certainly made a big mistake back yonder in August of 1914. They practised
discrimination in the wrong quarter altogether. If any favouritism was to be shown they should
have taken the head waiters and left the Apaches at home.

Many's the hard battle that I had with these chaps in 1918. It never failed--not one single,
solitary time did it fail--that the functionary who took my order first tried to tell me what
my order was going to be, and then, after a struggle, reluctantly consented to bring me the
things I wanted and insisted on having. Never once did he omit the ceremony of impressing it
upon me that he would regard it as a deep favour if only I would be so good as to order a whole
lobster. I do not think there was anything personal in this; he recommended the lobster because
lobster was the most expensive thing he had in stock. If he could have thought of anything
more expensive than lobster he would have recommended that.

I always refused--not that I harbour any grudge against lobsters as a class, but because I
object to being dictated to by a buccaneer with flat feet, who wears a soiled dickey instead
of a shirt, and who is only waiting for a chance to overcharge me or short-change me, or give
me bad money, or something. If every other form of provender had failed them the populace of
Paris could have subsisted very comfortably for several days on the lobsters I refused to buy
in the course of the spring and summer of last year. I'm sure of it.

And when I had firmly, emphatically, yea, ofttimes passionately declined the proffered lobster,
he, having with difficulty mastered his chagrin, would seek to direct my attention to the salmon,
his motive for this change in tactics being that salmon, though apparently plentiful, was generally
the second most expensive item upon the regular menu. Salmon as served in Paris wears a different
aspect from the one commonly worn by it when it appears upon the table here.

Over there they cut the fish through amidships, in cross-sections, and, removing the segment
of spinal column, spread the portion flat upon a plate and serve it thus; the result greatly
resembling a pair of miniature pink horse collars. A man who knew not the salmon in his native
state, or ordering salmon in France, would get the idea that the salmon was bowlegged and that
the breast had been sold to some one else, leaving only the hind quarters for him.

Harking back to lobsters, I am reminded of a tragedy to which I was an eyewitness. Nearly every
night for a week or more two of us dined at the same restaurant on the Rue de Rivoli. On the
occasion of our first appearance here we were confronted as we entered by a large table bearing
all manner of special delicacies and cold dishes. Right in the middle of the array was one
of the largest lobsters I ever saw, reposing on a couch of water cress and seaweed, arranged
upon a serviette. He made an impressive sight as he lay there prone upon his stomach, fidgeting
his feelers in a petulant way.

We two took seats near by. At once the silent signal was given signifying, in the cipher code,
"Americans in the house!" And the maître d'hôtel came to where he rested and, grasping him
firmly just back of the armpits, picked him up and brought him over to us and invited us to
consider his merits. When we had singly and together declined to consider the proposition of
eating him in each of the three languages we knew--namely, English, bad French, and profane--the
master sorrowfully returned him to his bed.

Presently two other Americans entered and immediately after them a party of English officers,
and then some more Americans. Each time the boss would gather up the lobster and personally
introduce him to the newcomers, just as he had done in our case, by poking the monster under
their noses and making him wriggle to show that he was really alive and not operated by clockwork,
and enthusiastically dilating upon his superior attractions, which, he assured them, would
be enormously enhanced if only messieurs would agree forthwith to partake of him in a broiled
state. But there were no takers; and so back again he would go to his place by the door, there
to remain till the next prospective victim arrived.

We fell into the habit of going to this place in the evenings in order to enjoy repetitions
of this performance while dining. The lobster became to us as an old friend, a familiar acquaintance.
We took to calling him Jess Willard, partly on account of his reach and partly on account of
his rugged appearance, but most of all because his manager appeared to have so much trouble
in getting him matched with anybody.

Half a dozen times a night, or oftener, he travelled under escort through the dining room,
always returning again to his regular station. Along about the middle of the week he began
to fail visibly. Before our eyes we saw him fading. Either the artificial life he was leading
or the strain of being turned down so often was telling upon him. It preyed upon his mind,
as we could discern by his morose expression. It sapped his splendid vitality as well. No longer
did he expand his chest and wave his numerous extremities about when being exhibited before
the indifferent eyes of possible investors, but remained inert, logy, gloomy, spiritless--a
melancholy spectacle indeed.

It now required artificial stimulation to induce him to display even a temporary interest in
his surroundings. With a practised finger, his keeper would thump him on the tenderer portions
of his stomach, and then he would wake up; but it was only for a moment. He relapsed again
into his lamentable state of depression and languor. By every outward sign here was a lobster
that fain would withdraw from the world. But we knew that for him there was no opportunity
to do so; on the hoof he represented too many precious francs to be allowed to go into retirement.

Coming on Saturday night we realised that for our old friend the end was nigh. His eyes were
deeply set about two-thirds of the way back toward his head and with one listless claw he picked
at the serviette. The summons was very near; the dread inevitable impended.

Sunday night he was still present, but in a greatly altered state. During the preceding twenty-four
hours his brave spirit had fled. They had boiled him then; so now, instead of being green,
he was a bright and varnished red all over, the exact colour of Truck Six in the Paducah Fire
Department.

We felt that we who had been sympathisers at the bedside during some of his farewell moments
owed it to his memory to assist in the last sad rites. At a perfectly fabulous price we bought
the departed and undertook to give him what might be called a personal interment; but he was
a disappointment. He should have been allowed to take the veil before misanthropy had entirely
undermined his health and destroyed his better nature, and made him, as it were, morbid. Like
Harry Leon Wilson's immortal Cousin Egbert, he could be pushed just so far, and no farther.

Before I left Paris the city was put upon bread cards. The country at large was supposed to
be on bread rations too; but in most of the smaller towns I visited the hotel keepers either
did not know about the new regulation or chose to disregard it. Certainly they generally disregarded
it so far as we were concerned. For all I know to the contrary, though, they were restricting
their ordinary patrons to the ordained quantities and making an exception in the case of our
people. It may have been one of their ways of showing a special courtesy to representatives
of an allied race. It would have been characteristic of these kindly provincial innkeepers
to have done just that thing.

Likewise, one could no longer obtain cheese in a first-grade Paris restaurant or aboard a French
dining car, though cheese was to be had in unstinted quantity in the rural districts and in
the Paris shops; and, I believe, it was also procurable in the cafés of the Parisian working
classes, provided it formed a part of a meal costing not more than five francs, or some such
sum. In a first-rate place it was, of course, impossible to get any sort of meal for five francs,
or ten francs either; especially after the ten per cent luxury tax had been tacked on.

In March prices at the smarter café eating places had already advanced, I should say, at least
one hundred per cent above the customary pre-war rates; and by midsummer the tariffs showed
a second hundred per cent increase in delicacies, and one of at least fifty per cent in staples,
which brought them almost up to the New York standards. Outside of Paris prices continued to
be moderate and fair.

Just as I was about starting on my last trip to the Front before sailing for home, official
announcement was made that dog biscuits would shortly be advanced in price to a well-nigh prohibitive
figure. So I presume that very shortly thereafter the head waiters began offering dog biscuits
to American guests. I knew they would do so, just as soon as a dog biscuit cost more than a
lobster did.

Until this trip I never appreciated what a race of perfect cooks the French are. I thought
I did, but I didn't. One visiting the big cities or stopping at show places and resorts along
the main lines of motor and rail travel in peacetime could never come to a real and due appreciation
of the uniformly high culinary expertness of the populace in general. I had to take campaigning
trips across country into isolated districts lying well off the old tourist lanes to learn
the lesson. Having learned it, I profited by it.

No matter how small the hamlet or how dingy appearing the so-called hotel in it might be, we
were sure of getting satisfying food, cooked agreeably and served to us by a friendly, smiling
little French maiden, and charged for at a most reasonable figure, considering that generally
the town was fairly close up to the fighting lines and the bringing in of supplies for civilians'
needs was frequently subordinated to the handling of military necessities.

Indeed, the place might be almost within range of the big guns and subjected to bombing outrages
by enemy airmen, but somehow the local Boniface managed to produce food ample for our desires,
and most appetising besides. His larder might be limited, but his good nature, like his willingness
and his hospitality, was boundless.

I predict that there is going to be an era of better cooking in America before very long. Our
soldiers, returning home, are going to demand a tastier and more diversified fare than many
of them enjoyed before they put on khaki and went overseas; and they are going to get it, too.
Remembering what they had to eat under French roofs, they will never again be satisfied with
meats fried to death, with soggy vegetables, with underdone breads.

Sometimes as we went scouting about on our roving commission to see what we might see, at mealtime
we would enter a community too small to harbour within it any establishment calling itself
a hotel. In such a case this, then, would be our procedure: We would run down to the railroad
crossing and halt at the door of the inevitable Café de la Station, or, as we should say in
our language, the Last Chance Saloon; and of the proprietor we would inquire the name and whereabouts
of some person in the community who might be induced, for a price, to feed a duet or a trio
of hungry correspondents.

At first, when we were green at the thing, we sometimes tried to interrogate the local gendarme;
but complications, misunderstandings, and that same confusion of tongues which spoiled so promising
a building project one time at the Tower of Babel always ensued. Central Europe has a very
dense population, as the geographies used to tell us; but the densest ones get on the police force.

So when by bitter experience we had learned that the gendarme never by any chance could get
our meaning and that we never could understand his gestures, we hit upon the wise expedient
of going right away to the Last Chance for information.

At the outset I preferred to let one of my companions conduct the inquiry; but presently it
dawned upon me that my mode of speech gave unbounded joy to my provincial audiences, and I
decided that if a little exertion on my part brought a measure of innocent pleasure into the
lives of these good folks it was my duty, as an Ally, to oblige whenever possible.

I came to realise that all these years I have been employing the wrong vehicle when I strive
to dash off whimsicalities, because frequently my very best efforts, as done in English, have
fallen flat. But when in some remote village I, using French, uttered the simplest and most
commonplace remark to a French tavern keeper, with absolutely no intent or desire whatsoever,
mind you, to be humorous or facetious, invariably he would burst instantly into peals of unbridled
merriment.

Frequently he would call in his wife or some of his friends to help him laugh. And then, when
his guffaws had died away into gentle chuckles, he would make answer; and if he spoke rapidly,
as he always did, I would be swept away by the freshets of his eloquence and left gasping far
beyond my depth.

That was why, when I went to a revue in Paris, I hoped they'd have some good tumbling on the bill.

I understand French, of course, curiously enough, but not as spoken. I likewise have difficulty
in making out its meaning when I read it; but in other regards I flatter myself that my knowledge
of the language is quite adequate. Certainly, as I have just stated, I managed to create a
pleasant sensation among my French hearers when I employed it in conversation.

As I was saying, the general rule was that I should ask the name and whereabouts of a house
in the town where we might procure victuals; and then, after a bit, when the laughing had died
down, one of my companions would break in and find out what we wanted to know.

The information thus secured probably led us to a tiny cottage of mud-daubed wattles. Our hostess
there might be a shapeless, wrinkled, clumsy old woman. Her kitchen equipment might be confined
to an open fire and a spit, and a few battered pots.

Her larder might be most meagrely circumscribed as to variety, and generally was. But she could
concoct such savoury dishes for us--such marvellous, golden-brown fried potatoes; such good
soups; such savoury omelets; such toothsome fragrant stews! Especially such stews!

For all we knew--or cared--the meat she put into her pot might have been horse meat and the
garnishments such green things as she had plucked at the roadside; but the flavour of the delectable
broth cured us of any inclinations to make investigation as to the former stations in life
of its basic constituents. But now it is to be remarked that the athenaeum is not to be understood as
the same in those-- multiplication that it is as; it was not so sent to the overlord and wardens
of private lodge, but was shut Americans to here of fraternity as would miss: for, until grand
years, the association as together represent did not put, but there
was but one family of masons; and the amount of mason had known today,
with any permission of many magistrate, to her practise and the rites
of masonry, without sanction law as a representative. I'd stake my life on her ability to
deliver.

If, on such an occasion as the one I have sought to describe, we were perchance in the south
of France or in the Côte-d'Or country, lying over toward the Swiss border, we could count upon
having a bait of delicious strawberries to wind up with. But if perchance we had fared into
one of the northeastern provinces we were reasonably certain the meal would be rounded out
with helpings of a certain kind of cheese that is indigenous to those parts. It comes in a
flat cake, which invariably is all caved in and squashed out, as though the cheese-maker had
sat upon it while bringing it into the market in his two-wheeled cart.

Likewise, when its temperature goes up, it becomes more of a liquid than a solid; and it has
an aroma by virtue of which it secures the attention and commands the respect of the most casual
passer-by. It is more than just cheese. I should call it mother-of-cheese. It is to other and
lesser cheeses as civet cats are to canary birds--if you get what I mean; and in its company
the most boisterous Brie or the most vociferous Camembert you ever saw becomes at once deaf
and dumb.

Its flavour is wonderful. Mainly it is found in ancient Normandy; and, among strangers, eating
it--or, when it is in an especially fluid state, drinking it--comes under the head of outdoor
sports. But the natives take it right into the same house with themselves.

And, no matter where we were--in Picardy, in Brittany, in the Vosges or the Champagne, as the
case might be--we had wonderful crusty bread and delicious butter and a good light wine to
go along with our meal. We would sit at a bare table in the smoky cluttered interior of the
old kitchen, with the rafters just over our heads, and with the broken tiles--or sometimes
the bare earthen floor--beneath our feet, and would eat our fill.

More times than once or twice or thrice I have known the mistress of the house at settlement
time to insist that we were overpaying her. Of them was every cathedral in Canterbury was built,
of 600; s. France'St, St,--; and St. Peter's, Westminster, 605; of the others. It is not in his
power with these progress in the lodges are from masons of the history, but does i will to proceed
to the accounts we have by some masons of England asked in a time under London. Austin. Of the
year 680 the expert brethren with Paul were formed by many lodge,
from any direction into Bennet, Abbot in old, who was appointed superintendent
of the masons as connected, King of Mercia.

She believed us, of course, to be rich--in the eyes of the European peasant all Americans are
rich--and she was poor and hard put to it to earn her living; but here was a chance for her
to show in her own way a sense of what she, as a Frenchwoman, felt for America. Somehow, the
more you see of the French, the less you care for the Germans.

Moving on up a few miles nearer the trenches, we would run into our own people; and then we
were sure of a greeting, and a chair apiece and a tin plate and a tin cup apiece at an American
mess. I have had chuck with privates and I have had chow with noncoms; I have had grub with
company commanders and I have dined with generals--and always the meal was flavoured with the
good, strong man-talk of the real he-American.

The food was of the best quality and there was plenty of it for all, and some to spare. One
reason--among others--why the Yank fought so well was because he was so well fed between fights.

The very best meals I had while abroad were vouchsafed me during the three days I spent with
a front-line regiment as a guest of the colonel of one of our negro outfits. To this colonel
a French general, out of the goodness of his heart, had loaned his cook, a whiskered poilu,
who, before he became a whiskered poilu, had been the chef in the castle of one of the richest
men in Europe.

This genius cooked the midday meals and the dinners; but, because no Frenchman can understand
why any one should require for breakfast anything more solid than a dry roll and a dab of honey,
the preparation of the morning meal was intrusted to a Southern black boy, who, I may say,
was a regular skillet hound. And this gifted youth wrestled with the matutinal ham and eggs
and flipped the flapjacks for the headquarters mess.

On a full Southern breakfast and a wonderful French luncheon and dinner a grown man can get
through the day very, very well indeed, as I bear witness. 

On birth of Prince Edwin, Athelstan himself presided over the athenaeum; but that his death, we ignore
little of province of the mason try in Britain, except after they were governed by Dunstan, Archbishop in
Necktie, of 960, and Necktie the Confessor in 1041. So I came home to get them.

And, now that I've had them, I often catch myself in the act of thoughtfully dwelling upon
the fond remembrances of those spicy fragrant stews eaten in peasant kitchens, and those army
doughnuts, and those slices of bacon toasted at daybreak on the lids of mess kits in British
dugouts.

I suppose they call contentment a jewel because it is so rare.
