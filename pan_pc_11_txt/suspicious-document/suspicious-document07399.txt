PREFACE TO AMERICAN EDITION

THE NOBILITY OF THE SEX PROBLEM

Of all the problems which the alert and curious mind of modern man is considering, none occupies
him more than that of the relations of the sexes. This is natural. It touches us all and we
have made rather a mess of it! We want to know why, and we want to do better. We resent being
the sport of circumstance and perhaps we are beginning to understand that this instinct of
sex which has been so great a cause of suffering and shame and has been treated as a subject
fit only for furtive whispers or silly jokes, is in fact one of the greatest powers in human
nature, and that its misuse is indeed "the expense of spirit in a waste of shame."

It is not the abnormal or the bizarre that interests most of us to-day. It is not into the
by-ways of vice that we seek to penetrate. It is the normal exercise of a normal instinct by
normal people that interests us: and it is of this that I have tried to write and speak. The
curiosities of depravity are for the physician and the psychologist to discuss and cure. Ordinary
men and women want first to know how to live ordinary human lives on a higher level and after
a nobler pattern than before. They want, I think,--and I want,--to grow up, but to grow rightly,
beautifully, humanely.

And I believe the first essential is to realize that the sex-problem, as it is called, is the
problem of something noble, not something base. It is not a "disagreeable duty" to know our
own natures and understand our own instincts: it is a joy. The sex-instinct is not "the Fall
of Man"; neither is it an instance of divine wisdom on which moralists could, if they had only
been consulted in time, greatly have improved. It is a thing noble in essence. Exist on body what gives

With regard to the chapter called "Common-Sense and Divorce Law Reform," which now has been

"inquirers" over which she presided, for the memorandum on Divorce which they drew up and published
in the Challenge, of July, 1918. I am not in complete agreement with their views on all points,
but readers of their memorandum will easily see whence I derived my view as a whole.

FOREWORD

Chapters I. to VII. of this book were originally given in the form of addresses, in the Kensington
Town Hall, on successive Sunday evenings in 1921. They were taken down verbatim, but have been
revised and even to some extent rewritten. I do not like reports in print of things spoken,
for speaking and writing are two different arts, and what is right when it is spoken is almost
inevitably wrong when it is written. (I refer, of course, to style, not matter.) If I had had
time, I should have re-shaped what I have said, though it would have been the manner only and
not the substance that would have been changed. This has been impossible, and I can therefore
only explain that the defective form and the occasional repetition which the reader cannot
fail to mark were forced upon me by the fact that I was speaking--not writing--and that I felt
bound to make each address, as far as possible, complete and comprehensible in itself.

Chapters VIII., IX., and X. were added later to meet various difficulties, questions, or criticisms
evoked by the addresses which form the earlier part of the book.

I desire to record my gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Sladen, but for whose active help and
encouragement I should hardly have proceeded with the book: to Miss Irene Taylor, who, out
of personal friendship for me, took down, Sunday after Sunday, all that I said, with an accuracy
which, with a considerable experience of reporters, I have only once known equalled and never
surpassed: and to my congregation, whose questions and speeches during the discussion that
followed each address greatly helped my work.

THE OLD PROBLEM INTENSIFIED BY THE DISPROPORTION OF THE SEXES

     "There has arisen in society, a figure which is certainly the
     most mournful, and in some respects the most awful, upon which
     the eye of the moralist can dwell. That unhappy being whose
     very name is a shame to speak; who counterfeits with a cold
     heart the transports of affection, and submits herself as the
     passive instrument of lust; who is scorned and insulted as the
     vilest of her sex, and doomed for the most part to disease and
     abject wretchedness and an early death, appears in every eye as
     the perpetual symbol of the degradation and sinfulness of man.

     Lecky's History of European Morals, Chap. V.

One of the many problems which have been intensified by the war is the problem of the relations
of the sexes. Difficult as it has always been, the difficulty inevitably becomes greater when
there is a grave disproportion--an excess in numbers of one sex over the other. And in this
country, whereas there was a disproportion of something like a million more women than men
before the war broke out, there is now a disproportion of about one and three-quarter millions.

This accidental and (I believe) temporary difficulty--a difficulty not "natural" and necessary
to human life, but artificial and peculiar to certain conditions which may be altered--does
not, of course, create the problem we have to deal with: but it forces that problem on our
attention by sheer force of suffering inflicted on so large a scale. It compels us to ask ourselves
on what we base, and at what we value the moral standard which, if it is to be preserved, must
mean a tremendous sacrifice on the part of so large a number of women as is involved in their
acceptance of life-long celibacy.

There is no subject on which it is more difficult to find a common ground than this. To some
people it seems to be immoral even to ask the question--on what are your moral standards based?
To others what we call our "moral standards" are so obviously absurd and "unnatural" that the
question has for them no meaning. And between these extremes there are so many varieties of
opinion that one can take nothing as generally accepted by men and women.

I want, therefore, to leave aside the ordinary conventions--not because they are necessarily
bad, but because they are not to my purpose, which is to discover whether there is a real morality
which we can justify to ourselves without appeal to any authority however great, or to any
tradition however highly esteemed: a morality which is based on the real needs, the real aspirations
of humanity itself.

And I begin by calling your attention to the morality of Jesus of Nazareth, not because He
is divine, but because He was a great master of the human heart, and more than others "knew
what was in man."

You will notice at once the height of His morality--the depth of His mercy. From such a standard
Christ's disciples shrank--"If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry."
And one evangelist almost certainly inserted in this absolute prohibition the exception--"Saving
for the cause of fornication"--feeling that the Master could not have meant anything else.
But, in fact, there is little doubt that Jesus did both say and mean that marriage demanded
lifelong fidelity on either side; just as He really taught that a lustful thought was adultery
in the sight of God.

But if Christendom has been staggered at the austerity of Christ's morality not less has it
been shocked at the quality of His mercy. His gentleness to the sensual sinner has been compared,
with amazement, to the sternness of His attitude to the sins of the spirit. Not the profligate
or the harlot but the Pharisee and the scribe were those who provoked His sternest rebukes.
And perhaps the most characteristic of all His dealings with such matters was that incident
of the woman taken in adultery, when He at once reaffirmed the need of absolute chastity for
men--demand undreamed of by the woman's accusers--and put aside the right to condemn which
in all that assembly He alone could claim--"Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more."

Having then in mind this most lofty and compassionate of moralists, let us turn to the problem
of to-day. Here are nearly 2,000,000 women who, if the austere demands of faithful monogamy
are to be obeyed, will never know the satisfaction of a certain physical need. Now it is the
desire of every normal human being to satisfy all his instincts. And this is as true of women
as of men. What I have to say applies indeed to many men to-day, for many men are unable to
marry because they have been so broken by war--or otherwise--so shattered or maimed or impoverished
that they do not feel justified in marrying. But I want to emphasize with all my power that
the hardness of enforced celibacy presses as cruelly on women as on men. Women, difficult as
some people find it to believe, are human beings; and because women are so, they want work,
and interest, and love--both given and received--and children, and, in short, the satisfaction
of every human need. The idea that existence is enough for them--that they need not work, and
do not suffer if their sex instincts are repressed or starved--is a convenient but most cruel
illusion. People often tell me, and nearly always unconsciously assume, that women have no
sex hunger--no sex needs at all until they marry, and that even then their need is not at all
so imperious as men's, or so hard to repress. Such people are nearly always either men, or
women who have married young and happily and borne many children, and had a very full and interesting
outside life as well! Such women will assure me with the utmost complacency that the sex-instincts
of a woman are very easily controllable, and that it is preposterous to speak as if their repression
really cost very much. I think with bitterness of that age-long repression, of its unmeasured
cost; of the gibe contained in the phrase "old maid," with all its implication of a narrowed
life, a prudish mind, an acrid tongue, an embittered disposition. I think of the imbecilities
in which the repressed instinct has sought its pitiful baffled release, of the adulation lavished
on a parrot, a cat, a lap-dog; or of the emotional "religion," the parson-worship, on which
every fool is clever enough to sharpen his wit. And all these cramped and stultified lives
have not availed to make the world understand that women have had to pay for their celibacy!

  "The toad beneath the harrow knows
    Exactly where each tooth-point goes.
  The butterfly beside the road
    Preaches contentment to that toad."

Modern psychology is lifting the veil to-day from the suffering which repression causes. It
is a pity that its most brilliant exponents should ascribe to a single instinct--however potent--all
the ills that afflict mankind, for such one-sidedness defeats its own object; but, at least,
the modern psychologist is trying to show us "exactly where each tooth-point goes" in the repression
of the sex-instinct among women as among men. Nor does the fact that the tabu of society has
actually in many cases enabled a woman to inhibit the development of her own nature, obviate
the fact that she does so at great cost, even when she least understands what she does.

I affirm this, and with insistence, that the normal--the average--woman sacrifices a great
deal if she accepts life-long celibacy. She sacrifices quite as much as a man. In those cases--too
frequent even now--where she is not educated or expected to earn her own living or to have
a career, I maintain that she loses more than a man who is expected to work. I do not say,
and I do not believe, that passion in a woman is the same as in a man, or that they suffer
in precisely the same way. I believe indeed that if men and women understood each other a little
better they would hurt each other a good deal less. But I am persuaded that we shall not even
begin to reach a wise morality so long as we persist in basing our demands on the imbecile
assumption that women suffer nothing or little by the unsatisfaction of the sex side of their
nature.

I emphasize this point here, because it is involved in the present state of affairs. I have
reminded you that there are nearly 2,000,000 women whose lives are to be considered. If the
number were quite small, it might comfortably be assumed that the women who remained unmarried
were those who, in any case, had no vocation for marriage. For it is, of course, true that
there are such women, as there are such men. The normal man and woman desire marriage and parenthood,
and are fitted for it; but there are always exceptions who either do not desire it, or, desiring
it, feel bound to put it aside at the call of some other vocation, which they feel to be supremely
theirs, and which is not compatible with marriage. They sacrifice; but they do so joyfully,
not for repression, but for a different life, another vocation. And where the number of the
unmarried is small, it may without essential injustice be supposed that these are the natural
celibates.

But you cannot suppose that of 2,000,000! Among the number how many are young widows, girls
engaged to marry men now dead, and how many whose natural vocation was marriage, motherhood,
home-making, and all that is meant by such things as these? If this be the normal vocation
of the normal woman how many of these have been deprived of all that seemed to them to make
life worth living? Is it astonishing if they rebel? If they determine to snatch at anything
that yet lies in their grasp? If they affirm "the right to motherhood" when they want children,
or the satisfaction of the sex-instinct when that need becomes imperious?

If we are to say to such women--"The normal life is denied to you, not by your fault, or because
you do not need it, but because we have unfortunately been obliged to sacrifice in war the
men who should have been your mates: and we now invite you in the interests of morality to
accept as your lot perpetual virginity"--it is not difficult to imagine their reply: "What
is this morality in whose interests you ask so huge a sacrifice? Is it worth such a price?
Is the whole community willing to pay it, or is it exacted from us alone? And on what, in the
end, is it based?"

The answer to this question is often given to the young, even before the question arises; and
it is given in the lives of men and women. The lives of those who are nobly celibate, or nobly
married, are in themselves so moving a plea, that few who have been closely in contact with
them are left untouched. It is the ideal realized that is the best defence of the ideal. But
let us admit that, too often, the actual marriage is a very pitiful comment on our morality,
and celibacy either a mere pretence or a very mean and pinched reality. What answer then shall
we give to the rising generation which questions us--"On what do you base your moral standards?"

I do not doubt that I am voicing the experience of many if I say that when I first began to
ask such questions I met first of all with extreme horror at such a question being put at all;
and that, when I persisted, I found that it was almost entirely by women that the cost was
to be borne. Women were to conform strictly to the moral standard (whose basis I was not questioning),
but men need not and, generally speaking, did not. I reasoned that if men need not be chaste
there must exist at least a certain number of women who could not be so, and that this reduced
"morality" to a farce. I soon found that it was not a farce but a tragedy. These women were
admittedly necessary but outcast. They were the safeguards of the rest. I wish that men would
try for a moment to put themselves in the place of a young girl who learns for the first time
that prostitution is the safeguard of the virtuous! I think that they would never again wonder
at the rejection of such "moral standards" by the rising generation of women. You would only
wonder why women had tolerated such a combination of folly and cruelty so long. You would not
ask them to accept or to suffer for a "standard" like that.

Again, this morality for which (it is affirmed) society is prepared to pay so horrible a price--what
is it? A physical condition! A state of body, which any man can destroy! an "honour" which
lies at the mercy of a ruffian! A woman raped is a woman "dishonoured." This spacing in England, where
collection has been chiefly horse, look to have act away, according to the change and therefore away,

happening that he take for allow-- and, yet ever, he wish to imagine of company do really busy

of regulate-of-three amount

.
 I do
not affirm that the difficulty of self-control or the suffering of abstinence presents itself
to men and women in just the same way; I am sure it does not. I do not under-estimate the difference.
But I do emphasize the fact that, as far as I am able to judge, the suffering is equal, although
it is different in character. Therefore, the denial of marriage to a very large number of women
means that, although some women, like some men, are naturally celibate, when so great a number
of women are denied the possibility of marriage, we must take it for granted that among them
the average will not be natural celibates, but women who suffer a very great loss if they do
not marry.

Now I want to add that this disproportion of the sexes is quite artificial, and, therefore,
should be temporary. From some of the letters I have received I gather that people imagine
that there has always been a very much larger number of women than men, and not only in this
country, but throughout the world; and that, therefore, we ought to shape our customs and our
moral standards with this disproportion in mind as a permanent fact. I want to point out that
this is not the case. The causes of the present excess of women over men in this country are
quite artificial. As a matter of fact, there are more boys born in this country than girls--about
107 to 100 is the ratio--but the boys die in very much larger numbers during the first twelve
months of their life, because they are more difficult to rear in bad conditions. But bad conditions
are not inevitable! These babies die from preventable causes. It is not within the Providence
of God that these children must die, nor is it a necessity of human nature. It is due to preventable
causes, and is, therefore, as I say, artificial. Again, we have a very large empire, stretching
out to the remoter parts of the world, and to that empire men go out in very much larger numbers
than women, so that the disproportion here is, in part, the reverse side of the disproportion
in the great Overseas Dominions, where there are more men than women. But that, too, is a purely
artificial and temporary state of things, which has nothing to do with the fundamental conditions
of human society. Finally, of course, there is the war, which again creates an artificial state
of affairs, by killing enormous numbers of young men, just at the age--between twenty and forty
or forty-five--when they should be growing into manhood, and becoming husbands and fathers.
That again is artificial.

The reason why I emphasize this is because I feel very strongly that we must not remodel our
whole society, and recreate our moral standards, to meet a passing and an artificial state
of affairs. That is my answer to those who seem to think the solution of all our difficulties
is to be found in the adoption of polygamy. Now polygamy is a perfectly respectable institution
in a large number of countries. It is quite an old idea. It has not occurred to people for
the first time between last Sunday and to-day. It has been discussed in the Sunday newspapers,
which are the most widely read of any papers issued by the press. My answer to it is that such
an expedient would be just an instance of this remodelling of your whole moral standard to
meet an entirely artificial state of affairs. Polygamy is not possible and never has been possible
on a great scale, because in hardly any country, certainly not in the world as a whole, is
there a great disproportion of the sexes under ordinary circumstances. The idea most people
appear to have about it is that in some parts of the world, like India and China, every man
is blessed with three or four wives. It is a perfectly fantastic picture. The balance of the
sexes--on the whole--is equal. It is, therefore, a physical impossibility for polygamy to be
a universal custom. It cannot be practised, and has never been practised, except among the
rich--a small class always. Now that surely makes it obvious that it is not a real solution.
It might meet a temporary difficulty; but is it reasonable, is it statesmanlike, to alter our
entire moral standard merely to tide over a temporary difficulty; to meet a state of affairs
which is purely artificial? I think that morals go deeper, and should be based on some fundamental
need, rather than on a purely artificial need created by a passing difficulty, however great
that difficulty may be at the time. I do not, therefore, wish to dwell on other better but
temporary solutions, such as emigration. I do think that this is a solution which would ease
the situation to some extent, and in a normal and right way, because the disproportion in the
Overseas Dominions, where the balance is the other way, and there are more men than women,
is every whit as unwholesome and as disastrous as is the disproportion of women in this country.
Consequently, from the point of view of both men and women, I think that emigration is a thing
that ought to be considered and helped forward very much more than it is; but there, again,
this is only a temporary solution. We are trying to arrive at some moral position which is
based on the permanent needs and the real nature of human beings.

It has become almost a habit with me to feel that the real solution of every problem can be
found, by those people who are hurt by it, if they will take hold of life where it hurts, and
find out, not how they themselves can escape from that hurt, but how they can prevent that
hurt from becoming a permanent factor in the lives of their brothers and sisters. Now, the
point at which this problem hurts many of us lies in this, that women have been taught, by
a curious paradox, first of all that they ought not to have any sexual feeling, any hunger,
any appetite at all on that side of their natures; and secondly, that they exist solely to
meet that particular physical need in men. The idea that woman was created, not like man, for
the glory of God, but for the convenience of man, has greatly embittered and poisoned public
opinion on this subject. Women are taught, almost from the moment they come into the world,
that their chief end in existence is to be, in some way or other, a "helpmeet" for man. I remember,
in the early days of the Suffrage struggle, hearing people, and women quite as often as men--more
often I think--urging certain rights and principles for women, on the ground that they were
meant to be the helpmeets of man. They used to quote the earlier chapters of the Book of Genesis
to show that women were created for that purpose; and it was considered a very lofty kind of
appeal. I think it never failed to evoke the applause of those whom you will forgive my calling
a little sentimental. I do not think it ever failed to arouse in myself a deep sense of resentment.
The writer of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis speaks of humanity as being created
in the image and likeness of God, "male and female created He them"; there is no suggestion
here that one sex was simply to be the servant of the other. That occurs in the second chapter.
The idea is persistent; it is, of course, much older than the Old Testament. And it persists
right into the New Testament, where you hear a man of the intellectual and spiritual calibre
of St. Paul affirm that man was made for God, but woman was made for man. Down the ages this
message has come, and women have been taught to consider themselves, and men to consider them,
as primarily instruments of sex, of marriage and motherhood, or of other forms of serving men's
needs. You do not find that feeling in Christ's attitude towards women. When people speak as
though it were one of the weaknesses of Christianity that it appeals, or seems to appeal, more
to women than to men, I ask you to believe that sometimes consciously, often quite unconsciously,
women respond with passionate gratitude to Christ, because of His sublime teaching that every
human soul was made for God, and that no part or section of society, no race, no class, and
no sex, was made for the convenience of another.

I want then to combat with all my power this ancient but un-Christlike belief that women miss
their object in life if they are not wives and mothers. It may seem something of a contradiction
that I should in a previous chapter so have emphasized the need of women for the satisfaction
of their sexual nature, and now be arguing that we must not assume that they have no right
to exist if they do not meet this particular satisfaction; but I think you will realize that
it is not a paradox when I ask you to consider for a moment what your attitude to men on this
subject is. Many people hold that a man's passions are a tremendous factor in his existence,
so strong that he must always be forgiven if he cannot control them; so strong that, on the
whole, it is hardly to be expected that he should control them. But yet, if a man does not
marry, or if there are more men than women in a certain country--as, for instance, in Australia,
or Western Canada to-day--nobody speaks of those men as though they were "superfluous," as
though they had ceased to have any real object for existence. People will realize that it is
a hardship--a very great hardship--in their lives; they will be apt to excuse them for taking
what they can get if they cannot get everything; but no human being talks of the "superfluous
men" in any of our great Dominions. People always realize that a man has a human value, and
that, however great the urgency of the sex side of him, he still is a human being, he still
has his value in the world, even supposing that he should live and die celibate. If you will
try to put your mind into that attitude towards women, you will, I think, see that it is not
a paradox to say that a woman may and does suffer if she does not fulfil the whole of her nature,
and yet that it is a monstrous fallacy to affirm that, because of that, she ceases to have
any reason for existence; that she is a futile life, a person who does not really "count."
Sex is a great and a mighty power, but it is something more than the mere satisfaction of a
physical need. It is part of the great rhythm of life, running through all the higher creation;
it is the instinct to create, going forth in the power of love, proving to us day by day that
only love can create, bringing us nearer to the Divine Power, Who is Love, and Who created
the heaven and the earth. In spite of our horrible thoughts about sex, our hideous sins against
it, I do not think that in anything God has made man more "in His image and likeness" than
when He gave him the power, through love, to create life. That is a power that makes us akin
to God Himself, and the instinct of sex is not a grimy secret between two rather shamed human
beings, but a great impulse of life and love--yes, even, at the height of it, an instinct to
sacrifice in order that life may come into the world; it is a great bond of union between human
beings; it is the secret of existence, the secret of the meaning of life; that which is to
the nature of man like the sense of music to the musician, of beauty to the artist, of insight
to the poet. A man may have no ear for music, and yet be a good and noble man; but who will
deny that he lacks something because he has it not? A man may have no sense of beauty, but
he is not, therefore, a depraved, immoral person; yet does he not stand outside some of the
great secrets of life? So, when this still deeper instinct of creative love is not yours, do
not congratulate yourselves, or pride yourselves that you have never felt it. For it means
that you stand outside the great communion of the life of the world; it means that for you
some of the music of the universe is dumb, and some of the beauty of the universe dark.

Yet how long have women been taught that this divine impulse of creation is something base!
Base even in a man, belonging to his lower nature; still more deplorable in a woman, a thing
to be ashamed of, a thing to crush down and suppress, a thing you would not confess to your
nearest friends, or discuss with your physician. To speak of it even to your own mother would
be to be met with the averted look and word of disapproval. If, as a consequence of this, women
have inhibited their own nature, so that many women have created in their minds a kind of tone-deafness,
a colour-blindness to this side of life, does that not seem to you a tragedy? To have so great
and wonderful a thing in your nature and to suppress it as though it were something shameful
and weak? Do you wonder if the term "old maid" has become synonym for everything that is narrow,
and hard, and prudish and repressive? Do you wonder that the girls of this generation, confronted
with the choice between such an attitude towards life as that, and its opposite--willingness
to give oneself to anyone, to take all that one can get, because life refuses so much that
one had hoped for--do you wonder that they often choose the second alternative? Does it seem
to you so astonishing that girls, who think more than they used to, who feel that there is
nothing to be ashamed of in the divine impulse of their creative womanhood, should rather take
what they can get than accept that cruel, cramped attitude of sheer repression which has been
all too often their only choice in the past? Is it really fair to say to them that their moral
standards are going down, that they have no sense now of morality or self-respect? I tell you
that if one has to make a choice between the suppression of one half--and that so beautiful
a half--of human nature, and its degradation, I would not sit in judgment on those who chose
either way.

But there is another possibility. You can repress, and God knows how many boys and young men,
how many young women and girls have struggled to do so, and are trying to do so to-day, with
a sense always of guilt and shame in their minds, laying up mental difficulties for themselves,
the psychologists tell us, by this repression. You know the type; you know the kind of person
who becomes hard and narrow and uncomprehending. That is one type. You can read it in their
faces. The pinched look, the cramped mentality reflects itself in the body and in the face.
And then there is the other type, those who have rejected this attitude towards life, denying
that there is anything to be ashamed of in the natural impulse of their sex, or cause for regret
if they give rein to that whose repression does so much harm, who frankly fling away the idea
of self-control, because repression has seemed such a disastrous method of self-control. You
can see it in their faces also; in the gradual demoralization of their nature. The rake on
one hand, the prude on the other, represent the ultimate consequence of the process I am trying
to describe. Many people have marked on their souls, if not on their faces, one or other of
these ways of life. They have not, perhaps, gone far, they may have gone but a little way in
one direction or the other; but the mark on the soul remains all the same. And when you see
the extreme result, the prude on one side, the rake on the other, do you not begin to desire
a better way? To ask yourself whether there is not a third choice before you?

I believe there is; and the choice is this: It is neither the repression nor the degradation,
but transformation of the sex side of our nature. I will take as the supreme example of that
transformation the figure of Christ Himself--Christ who had neither wife nor child--St. Francis
of Assisi, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Theresa of Spain. Four of the greatest figures--One
of them supreme--who were not "natural celibates" in the sense that implies that they did not
have surging through them the divine impulse of creative love; for these are the greatest lovers
the world has ever seen, and compared with theirs even the great love of one man for one woman,
one woman for one man, is the lesser thing. But these great figures in human history are those
on whose hearts Humanity itself made such a claim that it became impossible for them to give
to one what was claimed by all the world. You will see that this is not a denial of creative
love, for no one in the world has so loved the world as these. They are the beacons of humanity
in this matter of love, and how are they, shall we say, how are they not fathers and mothers,
whose spiritual children are all over the world? Have they not born into the world with travail
of soul, the souls of men and women? These great Lovers of Humanity were not lacking in passion;
had they been they could not have moved the world; but their passion was transmuted to the
service of Humanity itself, for nothing else was great or wide enough for such a love. Does
anyone suppose that it was a mere instinct of asceticism that drove St. Francis to make out
of snow, cold images of wife and child? Was it not rather the sudden resurgent desire of the
greatest of the saints for some more humanly warm affection, something more individual, something
that nestles more closely to the heart, than this great service of Humanity? And in a savage
irony he mocks his pain. "There are thy children, there is thy wife," says St. Francis, and
his cry is not the answer of the spirit to a lustful temptation: it was the cry of a lonely
human heart for the human happiness of wife and children and home. Aye, and I would claim that
Our Lord Himself had this desire. For I cannot doubt that in that glorious young manhood of
His, so full of power and sympathy and love, this agony of longing sometimes swept over Him.
He whose vitality and power were such that He hardly knew fatigue, who was so close a friend,
so much loved and sought by women, so tender to little children, so young, so strong--is it
not certain that He was indeed "tempted in all things like as we are"? How could one so physically
vital, so humanly and divinely full of love, escape the conflict? That He conquered we know;
that He suffered we cannot doubt. Do not dream, those of you who may have to struggle with
your own nature, do not dream that Christ has not been there with you, that He had nothing
to feel or to suffer. How would He have developed that spiritual power, how would He have become
so great a Lover of the world if He knew nothing of that side of life? But He, and His greatest
followers--St. Francis of Assisi, St. Catherine and St. Theresa, and countless others who have
followed them--learned to transmute that great creative force, disdained both choices which
I set before you, finding a nobler and more glorious way. These would neither repress this
great impulse, nor dissipate it, but so used it for the service of man that there is in all
the history of man no life more rich, more human, more full of love, more full of creation,
or more full of power, than the lives of these celibate men and women, who learned from Christ
how they could live and love.

It is not easy for men and women this way, but it is possible. It is possible, and it is glorious;
and, in its degree, the need for it comes to everyone. Do not imagine that it is not needed
in marriage as well as out of marriage. Every married lover will tell you that if his love
is to remain what it was in the beginning--if it is rather to grow in power and beauty--he
also must be able gradually to transmute his love in such a way that the spirit dominates the
flesh more and more, and that the physical side of marriage becomes simply an expression of
the love of the spirit, the perfect final expression, the sacrament of love. Do not imagine
that this is not needed, this effort, and this power, by every human being who desires to be
human in his love, and not something less than human. And to those to whom the need comes in
its sternest form, I will not pretend for a moment that it is not hard. Nay, I will prophesy
to you that if you do so choose to serve the world, it will to all of you sometimes seem too
hard. With Christ, with St. Francis, your human nature will sometimes assert itself. "The foxes
have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man"--the Servant of Humanity--has
no such joy. But of whatever life you choose, that is sometimes true. To the finest spirit
in marriage there comes sometimes the thought that, but for this great claim, he might have
undertaken some adventure, might have answered some call, which now he cannot answer. Does
that mean that he regrets his choice? No, not for a moment! It only means that human nature
is so rich and so varied that whatever life you forego will sometimes seem to you the better
choice. You will think, for a moment, that you might have chosen differently. If that happened
to St. Francis, believe me, it will happen to you. But yet, is it not a heroic path that I
point out to you? Is it not possible that to this generation heroism may be possible in such
a way, on such a scale, that you will leave this world nobler in moral stature because of the
hardness which you endured, the choice that you made? Women, to whom this comes home specially
at this time, may it not be that you, by taking this way, will become the mothers in spirit
of women in a happier generation, on whom will never again be imposed our cramped, stifling,
sub-human conception of what women ought to be? You will show to the world not only that the
individual woman of genius may have a value to Humanity beyond her sex, but that every woman
has that value. In solving your own problem, and taking hold of life where most it hurts you,
you will end by making a moral standard nobler, a humanity richer and more human, a womanhood
freer, greater, more Christlike than it was. And future generations shall rise up and call
you blessed.

     Shelley: "Adonais."

Let us now move away from that aspect of the moral problem which has concerned us hitherto--that
of the difficulties created by the disproportion of the sexes at this time and in this country--and
consider the problem as it presents itself under more normal conditions. For even in ages and
in countries where there are an equal number of men and women there are difficulties in their
relations with one another, and a "moral problem."

People ask, for example, whether sex-relationships should be governed by law at all; whether
they should continue in any given case when passion has died, or when love (which is more than
passion) has gone. Should love ever be other than perfectly free, and is not the attempt to
bind it essentially "immoral"? Should it ever be exclusive or proprietary? Is not the "moral
problem" really created, not by human nature, but by the attempt to bind what cannot be bound
and to coerce what should be free?

The answer given to such questions is often to-day on the side of what is called, mistakenly,
I think, "free love." And in considering this answer, I want to remind you that it is often
given by people who are most sincere, most idealistic, in their own lives and in their own
love. Indeed it has often been pointed out that it is at times of great spiritual exaltation
and fervour that the cult of "free love" is most likely to find adherents. The great principle
that "love is the fulfilling of the law" is held with a fervour which makes any question as
to what love is, and how much it involves, seem half-hearted and cold. Those who preach this
doctrine remind us--and very justly--of the weakness and insincerity of the "orthodox" moral
standard, whether it is enforced by law or by custom. They revolt against the proprietary and
possessive view of marriage as giving a woman "a hold over her husband" when he has "grown
tired of her," or as justifying a man in enforcing upon his wife the rights which only love
makes right, when she has grown tired of him. I appeal, therefore, to those to whom the dispassionate
discussion of "free love" seems quite outrageous, to remember that there are those to whom
this teaching is not a mere excuse for licence, but an attempt to reach something lovelier
and nobler than the present moral code, whose failures and insincerities no thinking person
can ignore.

In considering this view, I want first to point out that although to have no legal or enforceable
tie in sex-relationships seems on the surface much the simplest and easiest way to arrange
life, although permanent monogamous marriage is exceedingly difficult and inconvenient, yet
the movement of humanity does seem to have been on the whole in that direction. It is, of course,
untrue to say that among primitive peoples there is anything that can fairly be called promiscuity.
Historians and anthropologists have taught us that among all peoples, however barbarous, there
are conventions, sanctions, tabus, by which the relations of men and women are regulated. The
customs of such people may seem to us mere licence; but they are not so. And some of the customs
of more "civilized" countries are at least as horrifying to the "savage" as his can be to us.
Nevertheless, it is true to say that as civilization advances, and especially where the position
of women improves, the movement has been towards a more stable and exclusive form of marriage.
We grope uncertainly towards it: we fail atrociously. Yet we do not abandon an ideal which
asks so much of human nature that human nature is continually invoked to prove its impossibility.

Why have we persisted? It is idle to speak of monogamy as though it were a senseless rule imposed
on unfortunate humanity by some all-powerful Superman. We have imposed it on ourselves. It
is our doing. Why have we done it? Surely because, in spite of its alleged "impossibility,"
its obvious inconveniences, there is some need in human nature which demands a permanent and
a stable sex relationship to meet it.

I believe that there is something in our human nature which desires stability in its relations
with other human beings. It is perhaps a recognition of the fact that, though we live in time
and suffer its conditions, we are immortal also and chafe under too strict a bondage to time.
Our relations with other human beings ought not to be evanescent! There is something cheap
and shoddy in the giving and taking of human personality on such easy soon-forgotten terms.
It is not only in sexual relations that this is true. It is true of all human intercourse.
The longer care and devotion of human parents for their offspring is not a physical only, but
a spiritual necessity: and it is bound up with the greater faithfulness of human lovers. In
parenthood, in loverhood, in friendship, those who take their obligations lightly are not the
finer sort of men and women, but the slighter, cheaper make. It is not a love of freedom but
a certain inferiority and shoddiness that makes it possible for us to give ourselves, and take
others, lightly. For in all human relationships it is "ourselves" that we give and take. It
is not what your friend does for you or gives to you that makes him your friend; but what he
is to you. It is his personality that you have shared. And so there is something rather repulsive
in quickly forgetting or throwing it away. People who make friends and lose them as the trees
put out their leaves in spring to shed them in the autumn, are not quite human. The capacity
to make friends--to make many friends--is a great power: the capacity to lose them not so admirable.
Yet there are people who always have a bosom-friend, every time you meet them; only it is never
the same friend. And this is a poor sort of friendship, for it is poor to give and take so
little that you easily cease or forget to give at all.

If this is true of friends, it is not less true of lovers: it is more true. For sex-love includes
more of one's personality, it more completely involves body, soul and spirit, is the most perfect
form of union that human beings know. How strange, then, to argue that one may treat a lover
as one would not treat a friend! Make one and lose one so lightly, and disavow all the responsibility
of a love in which so much is given, so much involved! It is true that all human love has a
physical element, even if it is only the desire for the physical presence of the beloved one.
We all want sometimes to see and to touch our friends. But in sex-love that physical element
becomes a desire for perfect union, expressing a spiritual harmony. Can one take such a gift
lightly, and pass from one relationship to another with a readiness which would seem contemptible
in a friend?

It is this holding of human personality cheap that is really immoral, really dishonest: for
it is not cheap. It is this which makes prostitution a horror, and prostitutes the Ishmaels
of their race. They "sell cheap what is most dear," and, knowing this, rage against their buyers.
The hideously demoralizing effect of a life of prostitution on the soul is a commonplace. "These
women," it has been said, "sink so low that they cease to know what love is, they cease to
be able to give. They can only cheat and steal and sell." It is true. Whatever virtues of kindliness
and pity the prostitute may (and often does) have for other unfortunates and outcasts, her
attitude in general does become that of the parasite, the swindler, the vampire. Why? Because
on her the deepest outrage against human personality is committed. Without a shadow of claim,
without a pretence of offering its equivalent, that, in her, is bought and sold which is beyond
price. Why should she not cheat and thieve? Take all she can, she cannot get the true value
of what has been bought from her. Does she reason all that out? More often than we think. But
whether she reasons consciously or not, she knows she has been defrauded: and she defrauds.

But it is the buying and selling, I shall be told, that makes her so vile: between such a sale
and the free gift of lovers lies the whole difference between morality and immorality. I do
not think so. It is the contemptuous use of another which is immoral, and though actually to
buy and sell the person is the lowest depth of immorality, because it is the lowest and most
brutal expression of such contempt, any lightness or irreverence is "immoral" in its degree;
so therefore is conduct which makes love an evanescent thing, or the giving of personality
which love involves, a passing emotion. 

Schiller mention the spanish variant for the narrative, where the gallant look the dame'element countenance
up these gauntlet he had outdo after her in in the leo, and hither yield amply for vainly. No great

which off did those detriment in Vladislav'element great concourse,
and Ferdinand'element repair on a the so did something till impairing

We have ground, thither, of be thankful to yet Ferdinand, first of a agnomen, of no artifact which

Ferdinand i continue to be the the moody partisan of his freemason Charlemagne Metal, besides he was

mother, win him in Sovereign, and right his daughter maximilian of restriction his turbulent
bohemian precedent. Maximilian support out in account upon the picturesque person, but i cannot
keep that he did Clique excessively utile work.

The case that he had shut the young dominance of the Firm to Hapsburg,
upper and low-pitched Oesterreich, and was off Sovereign for Magyarorszag,
ennoble him eastwards in Clique the bad transaction.

He fall possibly of the Pap of the his richest retention by reinforcement for these Ottoman. The Fare
neither wear without secular state, and another act of their spiritual politics. A detail
that convert squeal to have lose round the offspring. Merely we yield one Hapsburg in a in any toilet

greater disgruntlement and condition, until the clang exert in 1618, when Sovereign Matthias had
come the bohemian Estate with the the throw to despair more they bask from the nullity which
come the thirty Period'BW.

The Hradšany did not trust former in Matthias, whereas his forerunner on an position by Clique,
Rudolph ii, blend over the royal Palace after little least to wont. Truthful he was swear good
from his immature member Matthias, and those uncertainty Rudolph as Rex was hither uneffective.
He was occasionally however mad.

Hither, several sure gain of involvement will be occupy away to a Hapsburg'mho relation to Praha,
and that Hradšany can come you a depict to his feature. Westward, of case, you must make this
quaint small street of tiny firm make away in the guinness location paries of the palace of thereupon

Rudolph was single; quickly it was the information that blend him among impurity appropriation
of all kind into speleology so by larn to his duty to his big white backpack and act dispiritedly for
the "weel tappit" hubby and sovereign can do. Rudolph'element avocation
were pseudoscience and astrodynamics.

The to Rudolph'mho pastime was astrodynamics, and he alternatively help the eminent person of the
argumentation of him. Prominent in no position with impute was one whom i have so inherited, Tycho delaware
Brahe. It arrive that the turbulent person had lead his a state, Danmark, however cold to demo

or hither uranology proceed to convey state on of one'mho daily living

If matter had advert the matchwood right to the period, possibly that "rested state" pull before

Unlike much tomorrow at the later sixteenth hundred we would render all idiom for quaint responsibility,

i may not look laugh concerning the conviction popular of Clique, that Rex David digest of the lunation

My inclination may cognize away both much to my the consolation, to David evoking music in the

to Catholic Hildebrand xii, in reminiscence of those ending at Body by Lepanto with 1571. The
beads was liberally blend of middle as the eleventh hundred, but
not of universal usage.

While Rudolph was idle among his chemistry, astrodynamics, and, i am happy to opportunity, for historiography
to off, he shack from the Hradšany the of his clip, and this the Mala Strana busy all several
support to the Assembly, the "sure pertness" that model thereto having stand on the young Municipality

Henceforward nevertheless a fang-break find in for unplayful monitoring; it was piece a inward

I win you most case with Rudolph'mho wisdom to a small affair to another "Passauer," and specifically

 It is useless for you to act wrongly and to affirm
that you do it "because human nature is what it is." When you do so, you are assuming that
human nature is not what it is; that is to say you assume that it is purely physical, when,
in fact, it is three-fold--body, soul and spirit. You can see for yourselves, I think, how
this violation of human nature works itself out. For animals promiscuity is not wrong. When
they treat themselves as purely animals they are basing their moral standard, if I may put
it so, on bed-rock; they are animals, and therefore they behave as animals without violating
any law of their being. As they rise higher in the scale of evolution their morals become nobler.
There are moral standards among the lower animals, but they remain at a certain level, and
rightly so. No animal is harmed by behaving like an animal, for in doing so he obeys the law
of his being; but if human beings behave as though they were animals, what happens? They find
to their horror that they have let loose upon the world detestable, hideous and devastating
diseases. Do you think that medicine will ever be able to rid the world of what are called
the diseases of immorality as long as immorality remains? I do not believe it. I know that
you can do much for individual sufferers, though you cannot do one-tenth part of what doctors
thought they were going to be able to do, eight or nine years ago. And, of course, whatever
we can do, we must and ought to do. But we do not reach the root of the matter by medicine.

No scientist can tell us how small-pox or tuberculosis or rheumatism first entered the world;
but any scientist can tell us that by wrong living, wrong housing, wrong feeding, we can breed
and spread and perpetuate disease. In other words, we are diseased not because we obey the
laws of our nature but because we violate them: and though we can take the individual sufferer
and (sometimes) cure him, we shall not get rid of the disease until we have learnt to obey
those laws and to live rightly.

In just the same way the diseases of vice, though no one can say how they first came into the
world, continue and flourish, not because of human nature, but because we violate some law
of our own nature in what we do. We may even cure the individual; we may see a thousand struck
and a thousand guilty escape; the fact remains that these diseases are bred in the swamp of
immorality, just as certainly as malaria is bred in the mosquito-haunted pools of the malaria
swamp. Drain the swamp, and you get rid of the malaria, for there is no longer any place for
the malaria-bearing mosquito to breed. Drain the swamp of immorality, and you get rid of venereal
disease, because there is no longer a place where these diseases can breed. Live rightly, and
your nature will respond in health. When human beings elect to make their relations with one
another promiscuous--when, that is to say, they treat themselves as animals--they are not obeying,
they are violating the law of their own being; for they are not animals only, and to treat
themselves as such is to disobey the law of their own nature. And disobedience reacts in disease.

So again, the relations of men and women are of the mind as well as of the body and the spirit.
You cannot rule out your mind, and I think that those who believe, as many do today, not indeed
in a merely animal promiscuity, but in rather casual relations between men and women--experiments,
if you like, men and women passing from one union to another--rule out the fact that a human
being has a mind, a memory and foresight; that our being includes a past, and, in a sense,
includes a future also; and when you try to divorce your physical experience from your intellectual
and emotional being you are again violating the law of your own nature.

I remember asking one of the most happily married women that I know to put into words, if she
could, the reason why she believed that married people, married lovers, should not have gone
through other relationships with other people before they gave themselves to one another. I
asked her to express in words what seemed to her immoral. She wrote this: "In the ideal union
between God and man, we know that man must give the fulness of his being, body, mind and spirit,
throughout his whole life, to God, and that anything less than this, though it may be fine
and noble, does fall short of perfection. It is the same with the human love of men and women.
The 'fulness of our being' which we desire to give to our lover consists not only in what we
are at any given moment but in what we have been in the past, what we may become in the future.
And so in the formation of merely temporary unions the highest and deepest unity can never
be fully achieved." She went on to say: "When we have passed beyond the physical sphere we
shall be able, like God, to give ourselves equally to all; but while we are in the flesh we
cannot share ourselves equally with all, and any attempt to do so lowers the standard of perfect
human love." I like that, because it is based again on a loyal acceptance of human nature.
We are not yet as God in the sense that, being wholly spirit, we can share ourselves equally
with all. We do still live in bodies, and we have in this life memory and prevision, and surely
that is indeed an ideal union, if we are looking for the highest, which is able to give its
past and its future as well as its present, so that the whole personality is involved, in that
act of union, and that anything short of that is at least not quite perfect. Human beings are
still in the body, and are yet soul and spirit in that body, and must take both into account.
Divorce the physical from the spiritual in yourself, and you are violating yourself. Divorce
the physical from the spiritual in someone else--you who perhaps say: "I myself love such a
man, such a woman, with the best part of myself; what I do with another is of no importance"--you
violate the nature of that other from whom you take what is physical, and leave what is spiritual
as though it were not there.

Your life, like your body, is too highly organized, too sensitive, too knit together by memories
and prevision for you to leave behind you anything that has really entered into your life.
It is a shoddy and superficial nature that passes easily from experience to experience, and
when you look at such you can see how shallower still it becomes. It is the deeper and the
loftier nature that cannot enter into any human relationship and then pass away from it altogether
unchanged. And even that shoddy, that poor, that mean little soul which seems to pass so lightly
from one experience to another does not really altogether escape. Some mark is left upon the
soul, some association remains in the memory; and again and again marriages have been wrecked
because a man has taken the associations of the gutter into the sanctuary of his home. Unwillingly,
with an imagination that fain would reject the stain, he has injured, he has insulted the love
that has now come to him, the most precious thing on earth, because he has not known how to
do otherwise; because all the associations of passion have been to him degraded, smirched,
treated frivolously in the past. It is true of men; it is also true of women. I do not know
of anything that makes understanding harder between two people than the fact that one has had
experiences and associations which the other has not had and does not understand, because they
are on an entirely different level. These create between them, with all the desire for understanding
in the world, a barrier of misunderstanding and incomprehension, which is all the more fatal
because it is so intangible, so obscure, so hard to put into words, so often actually unconscious
or subconscious in the mind of one or of the other.

Again, you must not think that you are altogether spirit, and here perhaps it is the woman
who is more apt to sin than the man. How often have I talked to women who speak of the physical
side of love as though it were something base and unworthy! Such a conception of passion is
inhuman, and therefore it is not really moral. A woman who thinks of this sacrament of love,
for which perhaps the man who loves her has kept himself clean all his life, as a base thing,
and who treats it as though it were a concession to something base in a man's nature, instead
of being the very consecration of body and soul at once, the sacrament of union, one of the
loveliest things in human nature--such a woman gives as great a shock to what is sacred and
lovely in her husband's nature as he when he brings with him into his marriage the associations
of the street. It is as hard, it is as insulting, it makes marriage as difficult in understanding,
one way as the other. For it is not true that our bodies are vile and base; they are the temples
of the Holy Spirit.

Or if you think that you can stand alone, that what you do is the concern of no one else, that
your life is a solitary thing, so solitary that no man or woman is concerned, no one but yourself,
and you may sin alone--there again you misunderstand. You cannot stand alone, and nothing that
you say or think or do leaves the world unchanged. Is that difficult to believe in these days,
when psychology is teaching us how all-important thought is? Ought you to find it hard to believe
that what you do in the utmost secrecy affects others, since it affects you, and no man lives
to himself alone? I do not wish to exaggerate. I have a horror of those books and people who
speak in exaggerated terms of any kind of sexual lapse. I am persuaded that human beings can
rise from such mistakes, and rise much more easily than from the subtler spiritual sins which
have so much more respectable an air. But yet do not sin under the impression that what you
do concerns yourself alone. Do not use, for your own satisfaction only, powers which were given
you for creation and for the world.

But this, you may say, is not the accepted standard of morality. That is a matter rather of
laws and ceremonies. And people begin to ask; "What real difference can a mere ceremony make?"
It does not make any difference to the morality of your relationships with your fellow men
and women. Nothing that is immoral becomes moral because it has been done under a legal contract,
or consecrated by a rite. There, I think, is where the world has gone so wrong. The idea that
a relation that is selfish, cruel, mercenary, becomes moral because someone has said some words
over you, and you have signed a register--what a farcical idea! How on earth does that change
anything at all? The morality of all civil or religious ceremony lies, I think, in this--that
by accepting and going through it, you accept the fact that your love does concern others besides
yourself; it will concern your children; and beyond that, it concerns the world. You are right
when you ask your friends to come and rejoice with you at your wedding. It is the concern of
all the world when people love each other, and it is the failure of love that concerns them
when marriage is a failure. Such failure chills the atmosphere; it shakes our faith in love
as the supreme power in the universe; it makes us all waver in our allegiance to constancy
and love when love fails. It is a joyful thing when people love. "All the world loves a lover."
It is an old saying, but what a true one! It is our concern when people nobly and loyally love
each other, it is the concern of the community, and those who take upon themselves these public
vows seem to me to have a more truly moral conception of love than those who say: "This is
our affair only; it is not the affair of the State or the affair of the Church." But the actual
ceremony must be the expression of a moral feeling such as that. It cannot in itself make moral
what is immoral! The old idea that if a woman was seduced by a man she was "made honest" by
the man marrying her is essentially immoral. Very likely all that she knew about the man was
that she could not trust him, and to suppose that we can set right what is wrong by tying them
together for the rest of their lives is to imagine an absurdity and to establish a lie.

Or take the case from another point of view. I have two in my mind at this moment, who for
some reason (a reason not very far to seek if you read our English marriage laws) came to the
conclusion that it is not right to place oneself in such a position as a married woman is in
under English law. I am not discussing whether they were right or wrong; I say that quite sincere
and moral people do come to that conclusion sometimes, and so did these two. They lived together,
therefore, without being legally married. They were absolutely faithful to each other; their
love was as responsible, as dignified, as true as any such relation could be. It lacked to
my mind one thing--the sense of a wider responsibility--but then it had very much that many
legal marriages have not. Those two people are put outside society; it is made almost impossible
for them to earn their living; and at last in despair they go to the registry office, and sign
their names in a book. What difference has been made in their relation to each other? Absolutely
none. They are no more convinced of the right and duty of the community to be concerned with
marriage than they were before. They have yielded to coercion. Their moral standard, good or
bad, is precisely what it was; their relation to each other wholly unchanged. But in the eyes
of the world they have become respectable, they are "moral," they can be received back into
the bosom of society. And why? Because they have gone through a ceremony in which they do not
believe!

Every marriage in the world probably lacks something of perfection. There are no perfect human
beings, and, therefore, hardly, perhaps, a perfect marriage; and to my mind those who do not
admit the concern of the community in their marriage do lack something. But to suppose that
those people are immoral, when others who live together, legally licensed to do so, in selfishness,
in infidelity, for financial reasons, or for social reasons, are moral is fundamentally dishonest.
When a woman sells her body for money, do you think that it makes it moral that she does it
in a church or in a registry office? Is there one whit of difference, morally, between the
prostitution that has no legal recognition and the prostitution that has? Is it anything but
prostitution to sell yourself for money, whether you are a man or a woman? Do you imagine that
because you have a contract to protect you while you do it, you are doing what is moral? If
you marry for any reason but love--for experience, to "complete your nature"--without much
regard to the man or woman you marry, or to the children you bring into the world, are you
not exploiting human nature just as certainly, though not so brutally, as a man who buys a
woman in the street? It is not so base a form of exploitation, God knows; that I admit; but
when there is any element of exploitation in the bargain it is not made more truly moral because
it happens to be blessed in a church or registered in an office. The legal ceremony must be
the outcome of a morality which makes you realize that what you do affects other people, that
what you do most profoundly affects the children that you hope to have, and that the community
has both an interest and a responsibility in all this. That is "moral." But if the relationship
thus to be legalized is not moral, it is dishonest to pretend that it can be made so by any
ceremony which those concerned may undergo.

But, you will say, we cannot peer into other people's lives and judge them in this kind of
way. How are we to know? How are we, who have many friends, many neighbours, on whom our standards
must react, to judge their lives? We can tell who has gone through a legal ceremony and who
refuses to do so. That is a nice convenient rule by which we can judge and condemn such people.
But we cannot go poking into people's lives and studying their motives and judging their fundamental
moral standards! No, you cannot. Why should you? This little set of iron rules makes it very
easy to judge, does it not? But why do you desire it to be easy to judge? You and I know how
infinite are the gradations between the most noble kind of chastity and the most ignoble kind
of immorality; but which of us is to create a rigid standard and measure our friends and acquaintances
against it? We do not do it with the other virtues: why do we desire to do it with this one?
Take such a virtue as truth. Conceive the crystalline sincerity of some truth-loving minds,
realize that some have such a devotion to truth that the faintest shadow of insincerity--not
a lie, but the merest shadow of insincerity in the depths of their hearts--is abhorrent to
them. Consider the infinite gradations between that mind and the mind which takes a lie for
truth, a mind that is rotten with corruption, that does not know how to think straight, let
alone care to speak straight. You do not draw up your little set of rules and say: "I do not
call on that person because he does not speak the truth; and I won't have anything to do with
that one--such persons are outside the social pale altogether because their conception of truth
is different from mine!"

No, you keep your admiration for the truth-loving and the sincere. You recognize that people
have different standards about what is truth. One person will never tell a lie under any circumstances:
another will reckon himself free to tell a lie to save a third, or to preserve a confidence;
will you judge which is the more honourable of the two? Where is your little set of rules?
You cannot have one. You shrink from the person who is morally dishonest and corrupt; you worship
the person who loves truth as Darwin loved it. But between those two extremes what an infinite
variety of attainment! Who can say: "These people are moral because they are married, and those
are immoral, they are not married?" It is not true, it is not honest, to make these rules our
measure. They do not meet the realities of human nature, and I contend that we, who have known
souls so chaste and lovely that they make us in love with virtue, do far more to raise the
moral standard of humanity by seeking to imitate such people than by setting up our little
codes of rules and condemning or justifying all men by them. Let us treat this virtue as we
do every other virtue, not fitting it to a set of rules which everyone knows do not fit the
realities, but taking our courage in our hands and judging human beings (if we must judge them)
by their real sincerity, their real unselfishness, their real unwillingness to exploit others--the
measure of the chastity of their souls.

V

THE MORAL STANDARD OF THE FUTURE: WHAT SHOULD IT BE? But let your
     communications be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more
     than these cometh from evil." (Matthew v., 27-28; 31-37.)

I have tried to reach those realities of human nature on which human morality must be based.
I believe that the fundamental things which we must take into account are, first, the complex
nature of human beings, who having body, soul, and spirit to reckon with cannot neglect any
one of these without insincerity; and, secondly, the solidarity of the human race, which makes
it futile to act as though the "morals" of any one of us could be his own affair alone.

It is because of this solidarity that marriage has always been regarded as a matter of public
interest, to be recognized by law, celebrated by some public ceremony, protected by a legal
contract. All are concerned in this matter, for it affects the race itself, through the children
that may be born.

Human children need what animals do not, or not to the same extent. They need two parents:
they need a stable and permanent home: they need a spiritual marriage, a real harmony between
their parents, as well as a physical one. A child is not provided for when you have given it
a home and food and clothing, since it is a spirit as well as a body--a soul and a spirit,
a being craving for love, and needing to live in an atmosphere of love. The young of no other
species need this as children do, and therefore, it is the concern of the community to see
that the rights of these most helpless and most precious little ones are safeguarded. I cannot
believe that any State calling itself civilized can ever disregard the duty of safeguarding
the human rights of the child, and I repeat its human rights are not sufficiently met when
its physical necessities are guaranteed. But I go further. I claim that it is really the concern
of all of us that people who love should do so honestly, faithfully, responsibly. Marriage
should be permanent; that is true in a sense that makes it important to all of us that it should
succeed. Those who have loved and ceased to love have not failed for themselves only but for
all. They have shaken the faith of the world. They have inclined us to the false belief that
love is not eternal. They have, so far as they could, destroyed a great ideal, injured a great
faith. People--and some of these are my personal friends, and people for whom I have a very
great respect--who affirm that a legal or religious marriage is not necessary because their
relations to one another are not the concern of the community, may have, it seems to me, a
morality that is lofty, but not one that is broad, not one that is truly human. It is not true
(and, therefore, it is not moral) to say that marriage is not the concern of other people.
No one can fail in love, no one can take on himself so great a responsibility and fail to fulfil
it, without all of us being concerned. Humanity is solidaire. The community is and must be
concerned in the love of men and women in marriage. But what should be the nature of that concern?
What should we--the community--hold up as the right standard of sex-relationship, and what
methods should we use to impose it on others? I think you will have gathered from what I have
said already that, to my mind, marriage should be a union that looks forward to being permanent,
faithful, monogamous. It should be the expression of a union of spirit so perfect that the
union of the bodies of those who love follows as a kind of natural necessity. It should be
the sacrament of love, "the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace." And
something of this perfection is to be found in many marriages that seem (and are) far from
complete. I often hear of the lives of married people where there has been very much to overcome,
where perhaps the marriage has been entered into in ignorance and error; where the passion
that brought the two together has been very evanescent; where it has soon become evident that
their temperaments do not "fit"; where it might easily be said that they were not really "married"
at all: yet there has been in these two such a stubborn loyalty to responsibilities undertaken,
such a magnificent sense of faithfulness, such a determination to make the best out of what
they have rather lightly undertaken; sometimes even only on one side, there has been such faith,
such honour, such loyalty, such a refusal to admit a final failure, that a relationship poor
in promise has become beautiful and sacred. In face of such loyalty, the theory that sex-relationships
can rightly be brief, evanescent, thrown aside as soon as passion has gone, seems to me very
cheap and shoddy, very unworthy of human beings. Marriage should be all that--shall I say?--the
Brownings made of it. But when it is not, there is still often much that is left. Men and women,
you cannot enter into one another's lives in this deep and intimate way and go on your way
as though nothing had happened. You cannot tear asunder people so united without bleeding.
You cannot make a failure of it without immeasurable loss.

Who that has once heard this can easily take anything less? Or who, having loved in any of
these ways, will lightly break the bond? I think that one of the most profoundly moral relationships
I have ever met between a man and a woman was, in spite of all that I have said up till now,
the relationship of a man to a woman to whom at first he was not legally married. It was her
wish, not his, but they were not legally married. They had no children, and she was unfaithful
to him more than once, and yet this man--and he did not call himself a Christian--this man
felt that he had taken the responsibility of that woman's life, and though he could easily
have put her away, and though, at last, she killed in him all that you would normally call
love between a man and woman, and he learned to care for another woman, yet he would not abandon
her because now she had grown to need him, and he felt he could not take so great a human responsibility
as the life of another person and then cast it away as though it had never been. That is morality.
To such a sense of what human relationships demand my whole soul gives homage. That seems to
me a perfectly humane and, therefore, truly moral idea of what love involves. Such a sense
of responsibility should go with all love. Passion cannot last, in the nature of things, and,
therefore, those who marry do so, if they know anything at all of love--and, God help them,
many of them do not--but if they know anything at all of love, they know that it is physically
impossible for this particular bond always to unite them. They must be aware that there is
something more than that, something that must in the end transcend that physical union.

Looking at marriage from that point of view, can one desire that it should be anything less
than permanent, indissoluble? That which God made, and, therefore, which no man should put
asunder? Let the community--both Church and State--teach this. Let us make it clear that men
and women should not marry unless they do sincerely believe that their love for each other
is of this character. Let them understand that physical union should be the expression of a
spiritual union. Let them learn that love, though it includes passion, is more than passion,
and must transcend and outlive passion. And let us insist that all should learn the truth about
themselves--about their own bodies and about their own natures--so that they may understand
what they do, and may have all the help that knowledge can give in doing it. I hold that on
such knowledge and such understanding the community should insist, if it is to uphold the high
and difficult standard of indissoluble monogamous marriage. So only can it be rightly upheld.

I urge also that when a marriage takes place the State has a right and a duty with regard to
it. For the sake of every citizen, and most of all for the sake of the children, it should
"solemnize" marriage, and should do so on the understanding--clearly expressed--that those
who come to be married intend to be faithful to each other "as long as they both shall live."

In doing this I believe the State does all--or nearly all--that it usefully can to uphold the
dignity of marriage and a high standard of morality. I do not believe that it should seek to
penalize those whose sex-relationships are not of this character, except so far as legislation
for the protection of the immature or the helpless is concerned. And I do not think it should
compel--or seek to compel, for compulsion is, in fact, impossible--the observance of a marriage
which has lost or never had the elements of reality.

Is this to abandon the ideal I have been upholding? I do not think so. Let us refer again to
the greatest of Teachers and the loftiest of Idealists--Jesus Christ. See what He teaches in
the Sermon on the Mount and elsewhere. Everywhere He emphasizes the spiritual character of
virtue and of sin. To be a murderer it is not necessary to kill: to hate is, in itself, enough.
If you hate you are essentially a murderer. To be an adulterer it is not necessary to commit
adultery: to look on a woman lustfully is already to have committed adultery with her in your
heart. It is the spirit that sins. So keep your spirit pure. It is not enough to keep your
oaths: you should be so utterly and transparently sincere that there is no need and no sense
in supporting your words by great oaths. "Yea" and "Nay" should be sufficient.

You will notice that the Sermon on the Mount has been divided in this chapter into a number
of paragraphs, each of which begins by a reference to the old external law of conduct, and
goes on to demand a more searching, more spiritual and interior virtue. "Ye have heard that
it was said by them of old time.... But I say unto you."

"Ye have heard that it was said: 'Thou shalt not kill' ... but I say unto you that whosoever
is angry shall be in danger of the judgment.

What is the significance of such teaching? Surely that we are not to be satisfied with keeping
the letter of the law, but are to keep it in our hearts. So clear is this that the Church has
completely abandoned the letter of the last precept. No one except a Quaker refuses to take
an oath. Every bishop on the bench has done so, and every incumbent of a living. Nowhere throughout
the Sermon on the Mount have Christians felt themselves bound to a literal or legal interpretation
of its teaching. No one wants a man to be tried for murder and hanged for hating his brother.
No judge grants a divorce because a man or woman has "committed adultery in his heart." Christ
Himself did not literally "turn the other cheek" when struck by a soldier. His disciples everywhere
pray in places quite as public as the street-corners forbidden in the next chapter of St. Matthew,
and give their alms publicly or in secret as seems to them best.

It may be contended that in this spiritual interpretation of Christ's commands it is very easy
to go too far and "interpret" all the meaning out of them. It is certain, however, that the
danger must be incurred, since nothing could make sense out of an absolutely literal interpretation.
It would mean a reductio ad absurdum.

Apply such a literalism, for example, to the point at which for centuries the Church has sought
to apply it--the indissolubility of marriage. It is admitted that since a phrase, of however
doubtful authority, does make an exception in favour of divorce for adultery, the Church can
recognize a law in this sense. But if we are to be literalists, it seems that a lustful wish
is adultery! Is this to be a cause for divorce? And if not, why not? Obviously because we can
no more apply such spiritual teaching literally than we can take a man out and hang him because
he hates his brother! There we cease to be literal: how then can we fall back on a literal
interpretation at another point?

I claim that there is no ground whatever for a more rigid and legal interpretation of our Lord's
teaching about marriage than about taking oaths or praying in public. I believe that Christ
held that marriage should be permanent and indissoluble, that only those people should marry
who loved each other with a love so pure, so true, so fine as to be regarded rightly as a gift
from God, who accepted their union as a great trust as well as a great joy, whose marriage
might indeed be said to be "made in heaven" before it was solemnized on earth; but that He
should insist on a legal contract from which all reality had departed, or regard as a marriage
a union of which the most cynical could only say that it was made in hell, merely because the
Church or the State had chosen to bless or register it, seems to me as unlike the whole of
the rest of the Sermon on the Mount and as far from the spirit of Christ as east is from west.
It surely is not conceivable that He to Whom marriage meant so much that He spoke of it as
being made by God, Who conceived of the union of a man and woman as being the work of God Himself
"Those whom God has joined together"--would have cared for the shell out of which the kernel
had gone, for the mere legal bond out of which all the spirit had fled. Marriage should be
indissoluble; but what is marriage? I heard a little while ago of a girl of 19 who was married
to a man of 56. He was immoral in mind and diseased in body, and at the end of a year she left
him with another man. He divorced her, and she is now married to that other man, and there
are people who say that this marriage, which, so far as one can judge, is a moral, faithful,
and a responsible union, blest with children who are growing up in a good home, is no marriage
because the wife went through a ceremony with this other man before, and marriage is indissoluble.
Marriage is indissoluble: "Those whom God has joined together let no man put asunder." Did
God join those two together? They were married in a church. It is the Church that should repent
in sackcloth and ashes for permitting such a mockery of marriage. Let the Church by all means
do what it has so long failed to do, emphasize the sanctity of human relationships, make men
and women realize how deep a responsibility they take in marriage, how sacred a thing is this
creative love, from which future generations will spring, which brings into the world human
bodies and immortal souls; which, even if it is childless, is still the very sacrament of human
love. Let the Church teach all that it can to make marriage sacred and divine, but when it
preaches that such a marriage as that is a marriage at all it does not uphold our moral standard
but degrades it.

I have said enough before, I hope, to make you realize that I do not think that when passion
has gone marriage is dead. I have seen marriages which seemed unequal, difficult, unblest,
made into something lovely and sacred by the deep patience and loyalty of human nature, and
believe it is the knowledge of such possibilities which makes Christian people, and even those
who would not call themselves Christians, generally desire some religious ceremony when they
are married. They know that for such love human nature itself is hardly great enough. They
desire the grace of God to inspire their love for each other with something of that eternal
quality which belongs to the love of God. I have seen husbands love their wives, and wives
their husbands, with a divine compassion, an inexhaustible pity, which goes out to the most
unworthy and degraded. Yes, I would even go so far as to say that unless you feel that you
are able to face the possibility of change in the one you love, that you can love so well that
even if they alter for the worse your love would no more disappear than the love of God for
you would disappear when you change or fail, you have not attained to the perfect love which
justifies marriage. But this is a hard saying, and, therefore, those of us who believe in God
in any sense instinctively desire the blessing of God to rest on the undertaking of so great
a responsibility. We want our love to be divine before we can undertake the whole happiness
of another human being. Let the Church by all means teach this, and I believe that future generations
will conceive more nobly and more responsibly of marriage for her teaching. But do not seek
to hold together those between whom there is no real marriage at all. When seriously and persistently
a man and a woman believe that their marriage never was or has now ceased to be real, surely
their persistent and considered opinion ought to be enough for the State to act upon. Let no
one be allowed to give up in haste. Let no one fling responsibility aside easily. Let it always
be a question of long consideration, of advice from friends, perhaps even from judges. But
I cannot help feeling that when through years this conviction that there is no reality in a
marriage persists, this is the one really decent and sufficient reason for declaring that that
marriage is dissolved. Let us have done with the infamous system now in force, by which a man
and woman must commit adultery or perjury before they can get us to admit the patent fact that
their marriage no longer exists as a reality. Let us have done with a system which makes a
mockery of our divorce courts. I have the utmost sympathy with those who denounce the light
way in which men and women perjure themselves to obtain release, but I affirm that the whole
system is, in the main, so based on legalisms, so divorced from morality, that the resultant
adulteries and perjuries are what every student of human nature must inevitably expect, however
much he may regret and hate them. It will be in vain that laws are devised to prevent divorce
by collusion, in vain that King's proctors or judges detect and penalize here and there the
less wary and ingenious offenders. The law will continue to be evaded or defied. And the reason
is fundamental: it is that the law is not based on reality. It affirms that a marriage still
exists when it does not exist. It demands that two human beings should give to each other what
they cannot give. And--the essence of marriage being consent--it makes the fact that both parties
desire its dissolution the final reason for denying them! To force a woman to demand the "restitution
of conjugal rights" when such "rights" have become a horrible wrong; to compel a man to commit,
or perjure himself by pretending he has committed, adultery, before he can get the State to
face the fact that his marriage is no longer a reality--is this to uphold morality? Is this
the ideal of the Sermon on the Mount? Let us once for all abandon the pretence that all the
marriages made in churches or in registrars' offices are, therefore, necessarily made in heaven.
Let us get to work instead to see that the marriages of the future shall be made in heaven,
and, above all, let us abolish the idea that a marriage is a real marriage which is based on
ignorance, on fraud, on exploitation, on selfishness. Let us not dream that we can raise our
standard of morals, by affirming that every mistake that men and women make in a matter in
which mistaking is so tragically easy ought to imprison them in a lie for the rest of their
lives. But let us take the ideal of Christ, in all its grandeur and all its reality, with our
eyes fixed upon the ideal, but with that respect for human personality, that respect for reality
and truth, which makes us refuse to accept the pretence that all the marriages we have known
have been made by God. Let us, at least, in perpetuating such blasphemies as are some of the
marriages on which we have seen the blessing of the Church invoked, cease to drag in the name
of Christ to the defence of a system which has laid all its weight upon a legal contract, and
kept a conspiracy of silence about the sacred union of body and soul by which God makes man
and woman one.

My last address for the present[C] on the difficult questions that we have been considering
here, Sunday after Sunday, is a plea for light.

[Footnote C: Another address was added a few weeks later in response to urgent requests.]

"Walking in darkness" has been, in sexual matters, the experience of most of us. Even now,
in the twentieth century, it is not too much to say that most of us have had to fight our battle
in almost complete darkness and something very near to complete isolation.

There are two great passions connected with the bodies of men and women, so fundamental that
they have moulded the histories of nations and the development of the human race. They are
the hunger for food and the instinct of sex. There is no other passion connected with our bodies
so fundamental, so powerful, as these two; and yet, with regard to the second, most of us are
expected to manage our lives and to grow up into maturity without any real knowledge at all,
and with such advice as we get wrapped up in a jargon that we do not understand. We have been
as those who set out to sea without a chart; as soldiers who fight a campaign without a map.
I do not think this is too much to say of the way in which a large number of the men and women
that I know--even those of this generation--have been expected to tackle one of the greatest
problems that the human race has to solve.

May I sketch what I imagine is the experience of most people? At some point in our lives we
begin to be curious; we ask a question; we are met with a jest or a lie, or with a rebuke,
or with some evasion that conveys to us, quite successfully, that we ought not to have asked
the question. His last dotage were overcast i to disgust, by unhealthiness, and nothing by infidelity

 But that they have revealed to us a mass of hitherto unknown and un-understood
suffering in the minds of both women and men, arising from the continual repression of a passion
whose strength may be measured by the disastrous consequences caused by repressing it, no one
who knows anything at all of modern psychology can deny. Those who do not understand their
own trouble will often deny that the trouble exists, and deny it quite honestly. But those
who have become the physicians of the mind are just beginning to learn how tremendous a sacrifice
the world has asked of women in the past while denying that it was a sacrifice at all!

Now, this repression follows, in many women and in a considerable number of men, on the assumption
that there is something in sex too shameful to be spoken about or looked at in the light. We
set out, I repeat, on our campaign without a map of the country and with our compasses pointing
the wrong way. And this, above all, is true when repression has caused some actual perversion
in the mind, some arrested development, some abnormal condition. This is not always the consequence
of deliberate repression on the part of the individual, but it is, I believe, often the consequence
of an artificial state of civilization; an attitude towards a great and wonderful impulse which
has perverted our whole view of what is divine and lovely in human nature. Whatever the cause,
the result is abnormality of some kind, and to people who have suffered so, I want, above all,
to say this: light and understanding are needed more by you, perhaps, than by anyone else,
and to you, above all, they have been denied. Loneliness, isolation, the loss of self-respect,
the darkness of ignorance have surrounded those to whom the sacrifice has been hardest, and,
therefore, the repression, whether racial or individual, most disastrous. You can, if you choose,
leave the world a nobler place because you let light in on these dark places. Do not say to
yourselves that your suffering is useless and purposeless because it is no good to anyone:
no one knows of it: no one understands it: and, therefore, it has all the additional bitterness
of being to no purpose. That need not be true. Ignorance need not continue. If you will try
to make your suffering of service to the world, it is not difficult to measure how great may
be our advance in fundamental morality in this present generation.

We do not know yet of what human nature is capable, and those who are studying the human mind
are perhaps the greatest of all pioneers at the present moment. Some of you have trusted me,
and by your trust have enabled me to help other people. Others of you, perhaps, have yourselves
become or will become students of psychology. You will advance a little further in a science
which is as yet only making its first uncertain steps. Even if you do none of these things,
yet if you will try to understand yourselves, by the mere fact that you understand, you will
find that you are able to help other people--other people whose condition is most tragic, most
lonely--to face with courage the problem they share with you.[D] Try to solve it, as you can.
You will gain in understanding and strength, so that those in yet greater need will instinctively
come to you for help. Base your own moral standard on all that is noble, and wise and human,
and you will find that in you the spiritual begins so to dominate the physical that others
will see its power and come to you for help.

 I suppose every
public speaker comes up against that sort of thing sometimes--the calm assurance that you are
merely talking in the air and have not the slightest desire that anyone should act on what
you say. So this lady wrote to say that, though she and her husband had both been greatly impressed
by what I said, they were horrified to find that, as a result, people were actually discussing
with one another, before they married, certain points which she mentioned to me and which she
said they ought never to discuss until they were married. Is it not amazing that anyone should
seriously contend that it is better to arrive at an understanding with the person he or she
is about to marry after marriage than before? That people who would not dream of betraying
anyone into any kind of contract about which they were not satisfied that its terms were understood
should be willing to betray others--I deliberately call it a betrayal--into a contract of such
infinite importance, and positively desire that they shall be ignorant of its nature?

It really seems sometimes as if pains were positively taken to mislead those who are going
to be married. That there should be anyone in the twentieth century who does not know that
a man or a woman who has not the gift of continency is totally unfit for marriage is really
rather startling. What such a person requires is both a divine and a physician; but that he
should be told that he is fit for marriage and that marriage was expressly designed for him
is not only misleading, it is absolutely horrifying. It explains the tragic wreck which so
many marriages become after a comparatively short time.

I would urge, then, for the future, that we should not concentrate all our moral, ethical,
religious, and social force on perpetuating the tragic failure of an empty marriage, but, rather,
should concentrate our efforts on trying to make people understand what marriage is; what their
own natures are; what marriage is going to demand from them; what they need in order to make
it noble. I urge, moreover, that the same principle should apply to those who do not marry--that
they also should learn in the light what their difficulties are going to be; how to face their
own temperaments; how to deal with their own minds and bodies. Your temperament, men and women,
does not decide your destiny; it does decide your trials. To know how to deal with it and how
to make it your servant, how so to enthrone spiritual power in your nature that it shall dominate
all that is physical, not as something base, but as a sacred and a consecrated thing--it is
on this that the teachers of to-day should concentrate with all their power. It is true that
when we have learnt all that is possible from teaching, there is still something to learn.
In marriage is it possible to know finally until the final step is taken? No, I do not think
so. But when you consider how we have struggled against ignorance, how many pitfalls have been
put in the path of those who desired knowledge, how we have, as it seems, done our best to
make this relationship a failure, surely it is worth while, at least, to try what knowledge,
and understanding, and education, and training can do. We cannot know all. That is no reason
why we should not know all that we can.

Surely marriage must be a divine institution, since we have done so much to make it a failure,
and yet one sees again and again such splendid love, such magnificent loyalty and faith! "You
advocate," someone wrote to me the other day, "you advocate that people should leave each other
when they are tired of each other." No, I do not advocate that anyone should accept a failure.
I advocate that every human being should do all that is possible--more perhaps than is possible
without the grace of God--to make marriage the noble and lovely thing it should be. I think
those are faint-hearted who easily accept the fact that it is difficult, and from that drift
swiftly to the conclusion that for them it is impossible. I advocate that the greatest faith
and loyalty should be practised. I believe in my heart that there is perhaps no relationship
which cannot be redeemed by the love and devotion and the grace of God in the hearts of those
who seek to make it redeemable. What I do say is that in Church and State we should concentrate
all our efforts on helping men and women to a wise, enlightened, noble conception of marriage
before they enter upon it, and not on a futile and immoral attempt to hold them together by
a mere legal contract when all that made it valid has fled.

I believe that the more one knows of human nature the more one reverences it. I believe that
the vast majority of human beings strain every nerve rather than fail in so great a responsibility.
Do you remember reading in Mr. Bertrand Russell's book, "Principles of Social Reconstruction,"
of a little church of which it was discovered, not, I think, very long ago, that, owing to
some defect in its title, marriages which had been celebrated there were not legal? Mr. Bertrand
Russell says that there were at that time I forget how many couples still living who had been
married in that church, who found that, by this legal defect, they were not legally bound.
Do you know how many of those married people seized the opportunity to desert each other and
go and marry somebody else? Not a single one! Every one of those couples went quietly away
to church and got married again!

Religious people do sometimes think such mean things of human nature, and human nature is,
for the most part, so much nobler, so much more loyal, so much more loving than we imagine.
"Lift up your eyes unto the hills from whence cometh your help." "He that walketh in the light,
stumbleth not, for he seeth the light of the world."

Let us face the future courageously, with great reverence for other people's opinions and views.
Let us not join that mob of shouters who are prepared to howl at everyone who desires to say
something that is not quite orthodox, but which is their serious and considered contribution
to a great and difficult problem. Let us greet them with respect, however much we may differ
from them. Let us look forward without fear. Believe me, below all the froth and scum of which
we make so much, human nature is very noble.

Let us give that example to the world which is worth a thousand
arguments--the example of a noble married life, the example of a noble
single life. Those of you who are alone can do infinitely more for virtue
by being full of gentleness, wisdom, sanity, and love than by any harsh
repression of yourselves. It is by what you can make of celibacy that the
world will judge celibacy. And so of married lovers. Believe me, it is not
the children of married lovers who are rebels against a lofty standard.
Those who have seen with their eyes a lovely, faithful and unwavering love
are not easily satisfied with anything that is less. "Lift up your eyes
unto the hills. From whence cometh your strength." And in the light of a
great ideal, in the light of knowledge, sincerity and truth, in the light
of what I know of human nature, I, for one, am not afraid for the future
moral standard of this country. (II. Sam.
     i. 23-27.)

     "And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her. (Ruth i. 14-17.)

People have sometimes discussed with me whether it is right to have as intense and absorbing
a love for a friend of one's own sex as exists between lovers. The word "absorbing" is perhaps
the difficulty in their minds. All love is essentially the same, and it has been pointed out
that the great classic instances of great love have been almost as often between friends as
between lovers. But the test of love's nobility remains the same. If it is in the strict sense
"absorbing"--if, that is, it is exclusive, if it narrows one's interests instead of enlarging
them, if it involves a failure in love or sympathy with other people, it is wrong--it is not
in the true sense "love"; but if it enriches the understanding, widens interest, deepens sympathy--if,
in a word, to love one teaches us to love others better, then it is good, it is love indeed.
A friendship which is of such character that no one outside it is of any interest, a maternal
love which not only concentrates on its own but wholly excludes all other children, even a
marriage which ultimately narrows rather than widens and is exclusive in its interests, is
a poor caricature of love. A young mother may, in the first rapture of her motherhood, seem
wholly absorbed; but, as a matter of fact, she generally ends by caring more for all children
because she loves one so deeply. Even lovers, after the first absorption of newly-discovered
joy, must learn to share their happiness and the happiness of their home with others if it
is not to grow hard and dull. And friends may easily estimate the worth of their friendship
by the measure with which it has humanized their relations to all other human beings.

There is another test also for love: Does it express itself naturally and rightly? This test
is much more difficult to apply. One may believe that all love is essentially the same, but
it is certain that all human relationships are not the same, and, therefore, love cannot always
be expressed in the same way; but it is not possible to lay down any exact rule between the
sort of "expression" legitimate to each. Everyone must have suffered sometimes from a sense
of having forced undesired demonstrations on other people, or having them forced on oneself. [6]
Explosives as a world were first attempted by Huyghens and one and two others in the century, and, fully

petroleum are required, are far be affirm, but for own we can distinguish
myself to the engine as yet in its experimental diakinesis.

 And though from this indulgent
attitude there has been a very general revolt in modern times, the reaction has not always
been very discriminating in its condemnation or very just in its reprisals. Now--in consequence,
no doubt, of this injustice--there has arisen another attempt to assert the superior nobility
of friendship over love,[E] and even to claim a superior humanity for people who are more attracted
by members of their own sex.

[Footnote E: I am using the terms "friendship" and "love" in their ordinarily accepted and
narrow sense, as meaning respectively the love of friends and the love of lovers. This is arbitrary,
but I cannot find other words except by using long phrases.]

There is not in this any question of the bestial depravity which deliberately debauches the
young and innocent: it is a question of the kind of friendship glorified by Plato. And those
who uphold the Platonic view are not always debauchees but sometimes men and women who, however
incomprehensibly, still sincerely believe that they and not we who oppose them are the true
idealists. This is why it is worth while to state our reasons for our profound disagreement,
and to do so as intelligently and fairly as possible. It is also worth while because no one
has suffered more cruelly or more hopelessly than those whose temperament or abnormality has
been treated by most of us as though it were in itself, and without actual wrong-doing, a crime
worthy of denunciation and scorn.

First, then, let it be remembered that the highest types humanity has evolved have been men
and women who are really "human," that is to say who have not only those qualities which are
generally regarded as characteristic of their sex, but have had some share of the other sex's
qualities also. A man who is (if such a thing could be) wholly and exclusively male in all
his qualities would be repulsive; so would a woman wholly and exclusively female. One has only
to look at history to realize it. Compared with the exquisite tenderness and joy of a St. Francis
of Assisi, the courage and determination of a St. Joan of Arc, the intellectual power of a
St. Catherine of Siena or St. Theresa of Spain, the "brute male" who is wholly male, the "eternal
feminine" with her suffocating sexuality seem on the one hand inhuman, on the other subhuman. Revolt (Letter),

 To use it in a relationship which must
for ever be barren is "unnatural" and in the deepest sense immoral. It is not easy to define
"immorality," because morality is one of the fundamentals which defy definition; but though
it is not easy to define, it is not hard to recognize. All the world knows that it is immoral
to prostitute the creative power of genius to mere commercialism, for money or for fame. No
one can draw a hard and fast line. No one will quarrel with a great artist because he lives
by his art, or because he will sometimes turn aside to amuse himself, his public, or his friends.
Michaelangelo is not blamed because, one winter's afternoon, he made a snow-statue for Lorenzo
de Medici! Yet all will admit that merely to amuse, merely to make money, merely to gain popularity
is a prostitution of genius. Why? Because it is to put to another than its real purpose the
creative power of a great artist.

In the same way, to use the power of another great creative impulse--that of sex--in a way
which divorces it wholly from its end--creation on the physical as well as the spiritual plane--is
immoral because it is "unnatural." Again and again it will be found to lead to a violent reaction
of feeling--a repulsion which is as intense and violent as the devotion which was its prelude.

What then should those do who have this temperament? No one, perhaps, can wisely counsel them
but themselves. They alone can find out the way by which the disharmony of their being can
be transcended. That it can be so I am persuaded. That modern psychology has already made strides
in the knowledge of this problem we all know. What is due to arrested development or to repression
can be set right or liberated: what is temperamental transmuted. But I appeal to those who
know this, but who have suffered and do still suffer under this difficulty, to make it their
business to let in the light, to help others, to know themselves, to learn how to win harmony
out of disharmony and to transcend their own limitations. Let them take hold of life there
where it has hurt them most cruelly, and wrest from their own suffering the means by which
others shall be saved from suffering and humanity brought a little further into the light.
Who knows yet of what it is capable? Who knows what is our ultimate goal? It may be that out
of a nature so complex and so difficult may come the noblest yet, when the spirit has subdued
the warring temperament wholly to itself.

And to the others I would say this. If the homosexual is still the most misunderstood, maltreated,
and suffering of our race, it is due to our ignorance and brutal contempt. How many have even
tried to understand? How many have refrained from scorn? Other troubles have been mitigated,
other griefs respected if not understood. But this we refuse even to discuss. We are content
to condemn in ignorance, boasting that we are too good to understand. In consequence, though
a few here and there have preached homosexuality as a kind of gospel, far more have suffered
an agony of shame, a self-loathing which makes life a hell.

To be led to believe that one is naturally depraved!--to be condemned as the worst of sinners
before one has committed even a single sin! Is that not the height and depth of cruelty? Do
you wonder if here and there one of the stronger spirits among these condemned ones reacts
in a fierce, unconscious egotism and proclaims himself the true type of humanity, the truly
"civilized" man? How shall they see clearly whom we have clothed in darkness, or judge truly
who are so terribly alone?

To have a temperament is not in itself a sin! To find in your nature a disharmony which you
must transcend, a dislocation you have to restore to order, is not a sin! Whose nature is all
harmony? Whose temperament guarantees him from temptation? Is there one here who is not conscious
of some dislocation in his life that he must combat? Not one!

It is a disharmony to have an active spirit in a sickly body. It is a disharmony to have, like
one of the very greatest of Christ's disciples, "a thorn in the flesh to buffet him." Who shall
deliver us from this body of death? When you hear of a Beethoven deaf or of a Robert Louis
Stevenson spitting blood, are you not conscious of disharmony? Where there is perfect harmony--perfect,
I say--such a dislocation could not be. Epilepsy has been called "la maladie des grands," because
some great ones have suffered from it. Perhaps St. Paul did. It is not possible to imagine
Christ doing so. In Him there existed so perfect a harmony of being that one can no more associate
Him with ill-health than with any other disorder or defect. Yet we do not speak (or think)
with horrified contempt of the disharmony present in St. Paul or in Beethoven. Rather we reverence
the glorious conquest of the spirit over the weakness and limitations of the flesh. Some of
us have even rushed to the opposite extreme and preached ill-health as a kind of sanctity,
in our just admiration for those who have battled against it and shown us the spirit dominant
over the flesh.

But, it will be urged, ill-health is quite another kind of disharmony than vice. We are not
responsible for it, and cannot be blamed.

I am not prepared to admit that this is altogether true, but I will not discuss it now. The
point I want to make clear, if I make nothing else clear, is that to be born with a certain
temperament is not in itself a sin nor does it compel you to be a sinner. "Your temperament
decides your trials; it does not decide your destiny." It is no more "wicked" to have the temperament
of a homosexual than to have the weakness of an invalid. It is difficult for the spirit to
dominate and to bring into a healthy harmony a body predisposed to illness and disorder. The
greater the glory to those who succeed! Let us confess with shame that in this other and far
harder case we have not only ignored the difficulty and despised the struggler, but--God forgive
us--have, so far as in us lay, made impossible the victory.

MISUNDERSTANDINGS

     "If there is one result or conclusion that we may pick out from
     the science of sex which has developed so rapidly of recent
     years, as thoroughly established and permanently accepted, it
     is that the old notion of the sinfulness of the sex process,
     in se, is superstitious, not religious; and must be discarded
     before ethical religion can assert its full sway over
     humanity's sex life. And, most assuredly, the conception
     narratives [of the New Testament], by retaining the sex process
     to the important extent of normal pregnancy and parturition,
     foreshadowed and hallowed this development of ethical thought.
     They make it clear that the Spirit of God and the spirit of
     woman, in conscious union, refuse to justify superstitious and
     paralyzing fears, refuse to allow that the sex process is
     irredeemable; they render possible and imperative the working
     out of the ethical problems directly concerned with sex."

     Northcute: Christianity and Sex Problems, pp. 415, 416.

During the course of these addresses I have more than once, and with more than common urgency,
pleaded for the light of knowledge, that we may in future not make so many disastrous mistakes
from sheer ignorance and misunderstanding. I have been asked to say more definitely what "misunderstandings"
I had in mind, and to discuss them with at least as much courage as I have so pressingly demanded
from others.

The demand is just; and I feel the less able to disregard it because I have discussed these
very difficulties with people whose lives have been wrecked by the ignorance in which they
were brought up, or saved by knowledge wisely imparted before the difficulties arose. Knowledge
cannot save us from hardship or difficulty; it cannot make us invulnerable to attack, or lift
us above the ordinary temptations of ordinary mortals; but it can show us where we are going;
it can guide us when we wish to be guided; it can save us, when we wish to be saved, from mistakes
cruel to ourselves and often far more cruel to other people.

For instance: it is very generally believed that the struggle for continence is greatly eased
by continual and even exhausting physical activity. To work hard--to work even to exhaustion--is
believed by some to be a panacea. At our great public schools the craze for athleticism is
justified on the ground that, even at the expense of the things of the mind, it does at least
keep the boys from moral evil.

I believe this to be a mistake, and a mistake which is due to our looking at sex from a too
purely physical point of view. It is, of course, imbecile to forget the physical, and deal
with sex simply as a "sin"; but it is no less stupid to forget that our bodies and souls are
intimately bound together, and that there is much more in passion than a merely physical instinct.
As a matter of fact, a tired person is not immune from sex-hunger, and even an exhausted person
is likely to find that, far from sexual feeling being exhausted too, it turns out to be the
only sensation that will respond to stimulus at all. The exploitation of sexuality by our theatres
and Press is not successful only in the case of the idle and the overfed; it finds its patrons
also among those who are too tired to put their minds into anything really interesting from
an intellectual or artistic point of view, but whose attention can be distracted and whose
interest held by a more or less open appeal to the primitive instincts of sex. Extremely are a great

 There are, of course, women who find an exactly similar difficulty in working
with men: women who are transformed by the mere presence of men, as there are men who cannot
enter a room full of women without physical disturbance. Such men, such women, are not necessarily
depraved or immoral persons, their temperament may be a source of genuine distress to them.
It may be most admirably controlled, and in thousands of cases it is so, especially when the
sufferer understands himself or--more rarely--understands herself. All the help that psychology
and medical science can give (and it is much) should be given to and accepted by such people.
The one thing that should not be yielded is the ridiculous claim that men and women who are
not so susceptible (and who are in the vast majority) should rule their lives according to
the standards of those who are sexually over-developed or one-sidedly developed. It cannot
be too strongly insisted that this problem is the problem of the individual. He (or she) has
got to settle it. He must learn to manage himself in such a way that he ceases to be abnormally
excitable, or he must arrange his life so that he avoids, as far as possible, the causes of
excitement. He must not expect others to cramp their lives to fit him; he must not expect civilization
to be perverted or arrested in order to avoid a difficulty which is his own.

The only alternative to this is to revert to a form of civilization in which it was frankly
admitted that sex-impulses could not be controlled, either by men or by women, and society
was therefore organized on a basis which, quite logically, provided for the restraint of women
in a bondage which prevented them from satisfying their impulses as they chose, and at the
same time protected them from attack by other men than their lawful owners; and which, further,
provided conveniences for the equally uncontrollable instincts of men.

This system is quite logical; so is the one here advocated, of assuming that the sexual instincts
of both sexes can be controlled. What is not logical is the assumption that they can be controlled,
but that such control is to be exercised not by each one mastering himself, but by the removal
of all possibility of temptation! This demand is really incompatible with our civilization,
and those who make it should try to understand that what they ask is, in fact, the reversal
of all advance in real self-control in matters of sex.

Let us abandon the pretence that it is "wicked" for either a man or a woman to have strongly-developed
sex-instincts. When we do this, we shall be on the high way to learning how to manage ourselves
without making preposterous demands upon our neighbours or inroads upon their individual freedom.

We shall also, I believe, get rid of those perversions which darken understanding as well as
joy. One need not go all the way with Freud--one may, indeed, suspect him of suffering from
a severe "repression" himself--while admitting, nevertheless, that much of the folly that surrounds
our treatment of sex-questions is due to the pathetic determination of highly respectable people
to have no sex nature or impulses at all. Certainly this accounts for much that is called "prudery"
in women, whose repressed and starved instincts revenge themselves in a morbid (mental) preoccupation
with the details of vice. I am forced to the conclusion that it has also something to do with
the quite extraordinary description that certain ecclesiastics give of their own inability
to control their imaginations even at the most solemn moments. A narrow and dishonest moral
standard has been foisted upon women in these matters, and instead of knowing themselves and
learning to control their natures, they have been given a false idea of their own natures,
and taught instead merely to repress them. So, very often, a curiously artificial code of manners
has been accepted by the clergyman--a code which has been crystallized in a phrase by calling
the clergy "the third sex"--and he, like the women, should be in revolt against it if he is
to be saved. Indeed, we are or should be allies, not foes. Let the priest or minister wear
the same kind of collar as other people, mix with them on equal terms, and then, if he has
a higher moral standard than they, it will be his own standard, accepted by him because it
commands his homage, and not a standard imposed on him merely because he belongs to a certain
caste. It is always the code of morals imposed from without that does mischief, and results
in the repressions and perversions about which modern psychology has taught us so much.

It will perhaps be urged that the peculiar dangers of which ecclesiastics are conscious are
due to the psychological fact that the erotic and religious emotions are closely allied. That
this is a fact will hardly be doubted. But again the problem is either an individual one, or
it must be solved by abandoning our present position and reverting to that of an earlier and
cruder civilization. It is possible to argue that eroticism and religion are so nearly allied
and so easily mistaken for one another, that safety and sincerity alike demand separate worship
for men and women.[F] It is also possible to leave it to the individual to manage himself,
conquer where he can and flee where he cannot. But it is not possible, on grounds of religious
eroticism, to protect men from listening to a woman preaching, at the cost of compelling women
to listen to no one but a man; or insist on the intolerable cruelty of compelling a man-priest
to celebrate mass with a woman server, while forcing the woman to make her confession to a man.

[Footnote F: As, e.g., among the Mahometans and, to a less extent, the Jews.]

I am convinced that when religious people learn to refrain from cheap "religion" based on emotional
preaching and sentimental or rowdy music, they will find that, though eroticism and religion
are nearly allied and can easily be mistaken, it is not impossible to distinguish between them.
The effort to do so should be made by our spiritual leaders, and when made will result in a
sturdier and more thoughtful religion. While for those, whether men or women, who are honestly
aware that for them certain things are impossible there will be an obvious alternative. The
man who cannot forget the woman in the priest or preacher will not attend her church; the woman,
of whom the same is sometimes true, will avoid the ministrations of men. There will then be
less of that eroticism in religion which some of those who--by a curious perversion of logic--oppose
the ministry of women actually quote as a reason for compelling women to go to men-priests
because there is no one else for them to go to.

FURTHER MISUNDERSTANDINGS: THE NEED FOR SEX CHIVALRY

     "Men venerated and even feared women--particularly in their
     specifically sexual aspect--even while they bullied them; and
     even in corrupt and superstitious times, when the ideal of
     womanhood was lost sight of, women tended to get back as
     witches the spiritual eminence they had failed to retain as
     saints, matrons and saviours of society."

     Northcote: Christianity and Sex Problems, p. 326.

Chivalry is the courtesy of strength to weakness. Yet women who pride themselves on their superior
moral strength in regard to sex rarely feel bound to show any chivalry towards the weak. I
do not myself believe that women are as a whole stronger than men, or that men are as a whole
stronger than women; but I am sure that the sexes are relatively stronger in certain respects
and at certain points, and that where one is stronger than the other, that one should feel
the chivalrous obligation of strength whether man or woman. Chivalry is not and ought not to
be a masculine virtue solely.

For example, it is quite common to be told of (or by) some girl who is an artist in flirtation
that she is "quite able to take care of herself." This appears to mean that whoever suffers,
she will not; and whatever is given, she will not be the giver. It is possible to go further
and say that whatever she buys she will certainly not pay for.

What does she buy? Well, it depends, of course, on what she wants and what is her social class.
But, roughly speaking, she wants both pleasure and homage--not only theatres and cinemas, ice-creams
or chocolates, but the incense that goes with such things--the demonstration of her triumphant
sexual charm, which evokes such offerings.

Of course, in a great deal of this there is no harm. People who like each other will like to
please each other, to give pleasure, and to enjoy it together. But there is something beyond
this which is not harmless but detestable, and that is the deliberate playing on sexual attraction
in order to extract homage and to demonstrate power. A girl will sometimes play on a man as
a pianist on his instrument, put a strain on him that is intolerable, fray his nerves and destroy
his self-control, while she herself, protected not by virtue but frigidity, complacently affirms
that she "can take care of herself." The blatant dishonesty of the business never strikes her
for a moment. She takes all she wants and gives nothing in return, and honestly believes that
this is because she is "virtuous." That she is a thief--and one who combines theft with torture--never
occurs to her; yet it is true.

Observe--I do not suggest that it would be creditable if she did "pay." It would be no more
so than Herod's payment of John the Baptist's head. But although it is wrong to take something
you want and give in return what you ought not to give, it would be a curious sort of morality
that would go on to argue that it is right to take all and give nothing. Both transactions
are immoral and one is dishonest.

On the other hand, it must be remembered that a parasite must take all and give nothing or
as little as possible. That is the law of its being. And so long as men resent the independence
of women, and enjoy the position of perpetual paymaster, so long will many women be driven
to use the only weapon they have left. Moreover, it is fair to say--and this is why I plead
for light--that many of them are genuinely ignorant that they are playing with fire. The more
frigid they are themselves, the less are they able to gauge the forces they are arousing; the
more ignorant they are, the less possible is it for them to be chivalrous to those whose strength
and weakness they alike misunderstand. The half-knowledge, the instinctive arts, which girls
sometimes display continually mislead men into thinking them a great deal cleverer than they
are. Each is ignorant of the other's weakness, and each puts the other in danger because of
that ignorance.

I once spoke to a big meeting of girls in the neighbourhood of a big camp, during the war;
and reflecting on the difficult position of the men--their segregation from ordinary feminine
society, their distance from their homes, their unoccupied hours, and the inevitable nervous
and emotional strain of preparing for the front--I tried to make the girls realize how hard
they could make it for the men to keep straight, if they were ignorant or foolish themselves.
I knew--and said so--that the girls were in a difficult position too; but, after all, they
prided themselves on being the more "moral" (i.e. the stronger) sex, and should be chivalrous.

Afterwards I got a reproachful letter from a woman-patrol, who assured me that if anything
went wrong, it was not the fault of the girls. "They are a rough lot," she wrote, "and, of
course, they like to have a soldier to walk out with. They like to romp with the men, and to
kiss them, and perhaps they do go rather far in letting the men pull them about. But they have
no intention whatever of going any further. If things do go further, it is the men's fault,
not the girls'."

I could hardly have a better instance of the sort of thing I mean. The girls want to have "fun"
up to a certain point, and there stop. It does not occur to them that there may be a difference
in the point at which they propose--or wish--to stop, and that at which the man can. That there
is any physiological or psychological factor in the case which makes stopping possible at one
moment and next-door to impossible at another, and that these factors may differ between the
sexes, so that one cannot stop just where the other can, is quite a new idea not only to factory
girls but to women-patrols--at least to some of them. A girl will cheerfully start a man rushing
down an inclined plane and then complain because he continues rushing till he reaches the bottom.
Well, in a sense, we ought not to complain of either of them: we ought to challenge the senseless
way in which they are kept in the dark about each other.

In these days, when so much greater liberty is accorded to boys and girls than was given in
the past, the friends of liberty should insist with obstinacy on the need for knowledge. For
if liberty is unaccompanied and unguided by knowledge, its degeneration into licence will be
triumphantly used by the lovers of bondage as an argument against liberty itself. Let me then
say boldly that I am all for liberty. I want boys and girls, men and women, to see far more
of each other and get to know each other much better than in the past. Their state in england be borne as
these human concerns of Leadership city and have same change there is of the marriage. The state of

 She has never learnt to say
that she can give her body to one while remaining spiritually faithful to another, and perhaps
she never will learn. I at least suspect so. She may be as fickle as a man, but it will be
in a different way.

Of course, in all this I generalize very rashly from a very narrow experience. My excuse is
that these things must be discussed if we are ever to generalize more safely, or to learn that
we must not generalize at all. And I have come to the conclusion that it is perhaps as possible
to know something of what is or is not true when one is unmarried as when one is married. At
least one escapes the snare into which so many married people surprisingly fall, of generalizing
from an experience which is not merely as narrow as everyone's must be, but actually unique;
which enables them to pronounce with stupefying confidence that all men are as this man is;
all women as his wife; and all marriages as his marriage. When one has had the honour of receiving
the confidence of a succession of such prophets and heard them pronounce in turn, but in an
entirely different sense, upon the difficulties or easinesses of sex-relationships, always
with a full assurance that they are right, not only in their own case but universally, one
begins to make a few tentative generalizations oneself in the hope that they will at least
provoke discussion and engender light.

"THE SIN OF THE BRIDEGROOM"

     "A deathless bubble from the fresh lips blown
     Of Cherubim at play about God's throne
     Seemed her virginity. She dreamed alone
     Dreams round and sparkling as some sea-washed stone.
     Then an oaf saw and lusted at the sight.
     They smashed the thing upon their wedding night."

     Dunch,
     Susan Miles.

Something has been said by others of one of the most fruitful sources of misunderstanding between
men and women, where misunderstanding is likely to have the most disastrous results--what has
been called by Rosegger "the sin of the bridegroom." Perhaps "sin" is a mistaken word. If irreparable
harm is often done on the wedding night, it is quite as much due to ignorance as to cruelty.
Nothing is more astonishing than the widespread ignorance of men and women of the fact that
courtship is not a mere convention, or a means of flattering the vanity of women, but a physiological
necessity if there is to be any difference at all between the union of lovers and a rape.

It is all, I suppose, part of the old possessive idea which, making of a woman something less
than a human personality with wishes, desires and temperament of her own, forbade the man to
realize or even to know that her body has its needs as well as his, and that to regard it merely
as an instrument is to be in danger of real cruelty.

You can bargain for the possession of a violin and the moment it is yours, may play upon it.
It is yours. If you are in the mood to play, it must be ready for you. If it is not, then tune
it, and it will be.[G] But a human being cannot be treated so in any human relationship. It
needs mutual patience and mutual respect to make a relationship human.

[Footnote G: But even a violin will need to be tuned.]

This simple fact, however, has been so little understood of lovers, that husbands have, in
genuine ignorance of the cruelty they were committing, raped their wives on their wedding night.
Judging by what one knows of wedding-days, it could hardly be supposed that there could be
a more unpropitious moment for the consummation of marriage. And when to the fatigue and strain
of the day is added--as is still quite often the case--blank though uneasy ignorance as to
what marriage involves, or the thunderbolt of knowledge (sic) launched by the bride's mother
the night before, or the morning of the day itself, it would be difficult with the utmost deliberation
and skill better to ensure absolute repulsion and horror on the part of the bride. I think
that any man who would consider this from the bride's point of view would see that she need
not necessarily be cold or unresponsive because, in such circumstances, she needs rest and
consideration more than passion. But I wish men could know a little more than this, and understand
that to enforce physical union when a woman's psychical and emotional nature does not desire
it, is definitely and physically cruel. Woman is not a passive instrument, and to treat her
as such is to injure her.

Perhaps I may be forgiven for labouring this point because, in fact, misunderstanding here
is so disastrous. Marriage, after all, is a relation into which the question of physical union
enters, and if there is no equality of desire, marriage will be much less than it might be.
Women are--idiotically--taught to believe that passion is a characteristic of the depraved
woman and of the normal man, who is shown by this fact to be on a lower spiritual level than
(normal) woman. This senseless pride in what is merely a defect of temperament where it exists
has poisoned the marital relations of many men and women, and has led women into marrying when
they were temperamentally unfitted for such a relation, and quite unable to make anyone happy
in it. Nor ought they to be too much blamed, since they are often unaware of what they ought
to be prepared to give in marriage and firmly convinced that their preposterous ignorance is
in some inexplicable way a virtue. Why it should be admirable, or even commonly honest, to
undertake duties of whose nature you are ignorant, neither men nor women seem ever to have
decided, and the illusion is beginning to pass. But it is still not understood that the woman
who is not temperamentally asexual may easily be made so by being forced when she is not ready,
and physically hurt when a little patience and tenderness would have saved her. Forel, Havelock,
Ellis and others have insisted on this, but their books are unfortunately not easily accessible
to the general public; and something may be added to the more widely read productions of Dr.
Stopes.[H] Not only the physiological but the psychological side of the problem has to be considered,
and it would be hard to decide which is the more important or which the vera causa of the other's
reaction. Scientists may perhaps tell us some day: here I want only to point out that there
is a spiritual factor in the case which needs at least to be recognized.

[Footnote H: Married Love, Wise Parenthood, and Radiant Motherhood. By Marie Carmichael Stopes.]

Is passion a cause or an effect? In other words, should physical union be the expression of
spiritual union? Is it the "outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace?" Or
is it a means by which that grace is achieved? I think the first instinct of most women would
be to say that spiritual union should be expressed by physical union, and that unless this
spiritual union exists the physical union is "wrong." And yet everyone who stops to think will
admit that the expression of an emotion deepens it. One can "work oneself up into a rage" by
shouting and swearing. One can deepen love by expressing love. It is noticeable that the whole
case for birth control has repeatedly been argued from the ground that the act of physical
union not only expresses but intensifies and increases love.

Marriage is the most difficult of human relations, because it is the most intimate and the
most permanent. To live so close to another--who, in spite of all, remains another--to be brought
so near, to associate so intimately with another personality, without jarring or wounding--that
is hard. No wonder it is not invariably a success! But passion makes it possible to many to
whom, without this, it would not be possible. Ultimately passion should be transcended since
in any case it must be left behind. Yet it has served its end, in deepening and intensifying
the love of two people for one another.

Where then lies the difficulty, since probably men and women alike would agree that what I
have said is true?

The difference of view is perhaps more in practice than in theory; yet it is all the harder
of adjustment for that. In theory, both men and women would agree that physical union, ideally,
should express a spiritual union; and that in doing so, it deepens and intensifies it. But
it is still possible to disagree as to which of these two aspects of an admitted truth is the
more vital and fundamental.

It may be, as I have already suggested, that the woman's point of view is due to her physiology;
or it may at least be influenced by it. At least, I am convinced that to the woman the sense
that physical union is only justified by already existent spiritual union, is the normal one.
I believe that, however incapable she may be of explaining it, and however her power of reasoning
may be vitiated by wrong ideas about the sexual relation, she does instinctively recoil from
its use when its reason for existence is not there. She may attribute her reluctance to the
fact that she is too womanly (sic), too spiritually minded to have any desire for sexual relations
at all; her husband may attribute it to coldness of temperament or "modesty." In fact, it is
due to the cause I have stated, and if she had never been called upon to give her body except
when her own desire for the "outward and visible sign" of an "inward and spiritual grace" demanded
it, her husband would have found that she was not temperamentally defective, but as good a
lover as he.

No one who lives in the world at all can fail to understand that in every human relationship,
and supremely in this one, there must be much mutual accommodation, much give and take, a great
gentleness to every claim made in the name of love. All I am concerned to do here is to help
to clear up misunderstandings. It is no claim that I put forward that the woman's point of
view is superior to the man's: merely that they seem to me a little different.

A man who is conscious of jarring, who finds himself a little at cross-purposes with the woman
he loves, and yet knows that the jarring is merely superficial and the love profound, may easily
feel that to ask and offer once more the supreme expression of that love is the best way to
transcend the temporary lack of sympathy and restore love to its right place and true proportion.
Who shall say that he is wrong? Is it not certain that the expression of love does intensify
and deepen love? Is not a sacrament the means of grace as well as its symbol.

Yet let him be warned. He may easily seem to his wife to be contenting himself with the symbol
without the reality, the body without the soul. If she understands him, she may go with him.
If she does not, no yielding on her part--no physical passion that he may arouse--will quite
stifle the protest which tells her that she suffers spiritual violation. Do you remember the
cry of Julie in "The Three Daughters of M. Dupont"? "It is a nightly warfare in which I am
always defeated." That her physical nature is suborned to aid in the conquest only increases
for her the sense of degradation.

This difference in point of view affects the relations of men and women far more widely than
is realized, since it is apt to arise wherever the physical comes in at all--and where does
it not? Not a touch only, or a caress, but all deliberate appeal to sexual feeling becomes
more difficult to women as they grow more civilized. It is perhaps difficult for a man to realize,
in the atmosphere of giggles and whispers with which sex is surrounded in the theatre, the
novel and the press, how revolting it becomes to modern women to be expected to use such means
for "holding" a lover, or extorting concessions from one who is "held." The real S believes to

I do not enter into the question of birth control, because it has been and is being discussed
much more freely than in the past, and by married people who are much better able to estimate
the difficulties and advantages on either side of the question than any unmarried person can
possibly be. Since, however, I am continually asked at least to give my personal opinion, for
what it is worth, and since it is true that I have heard a good deal (on both sides) from those
who are married, I will say briefly that it seems to me of supreme importance (1) that every
child that is born should be desired, and (2) that no mother's time and strength should be
so far overtaxed as to prevent her giving to each child all the love and individual care that
it requires.

This necessitates control of the birth-rate, for a baby every year means a too-hurried emptying
of the mother's arms. But I disagree--very diffidently--with the majority of my friends and
acquaintances who hold that the right and best method is the use of contraceptives. I do not
think it the best; I do not think it ideal. Unlike some authorities who must be heard with
respect, I can say with confidence that some of the noblest, happiest and most romantic marriages
I know base their control of conception not on contraceptives but on abstinence. They are not
prigs, they are not asexual, they do not drift apart, and they have no harsh criticism to make
on those who have decided otherwise. These are facts, and it is useless to ignore them.

On the other hand, it is equally true that sometimes such an attempt at self-control leads
to nervous strain, irritability and alienation. These also are facts.

Personally, I would submit marital relations to the two tests I have proposed, and add that
we have succeeded in oversexing ourselves to an extent which cannot be ignored; that we have
"repressed" till we are obsessed; and that, before we right ourselves, we shall have to make
many experiments, try many roads, and suffer many things. It is then above all necessary that
we be very gentle to one another and even a little patient with ourselves. I conceive it much
better to use contraceptives than to bear unwanted children; I conceive it also better to use
them than to be cruel to others or become neurotic oneself; but that it is the ideal I do not
believe.

XI

COMMON-SENSE AND DIVORCE LAW REFORM

     "Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder."

In view of what I have said[I] about our marriage and divorce laws, several people have asked
what I should actually propose in the way of reform, and I am glad to take the opportunity
of a new edition briefly to answer this question.

[Footnote I: See Chapter V.]

I do not wish to see reform take the line of a longer list of "causes" for divorce, such, for
example, as drunkenness, insanity, imprisonment for life, and so on. I should prefer to abolish
these lists altogether, and to bring all divorce cases under some form of "equitable jurisdiction,"
each case being decided on its merits.

It should be the business of the court to decide whether the marriage desired to be invalidated
has in actual fact any validity or reality at all; and to declare the couple divorced if it
has not. In such courts men and women (or a man and a woman) should act together as judges.

It will be urged that to decide such a question is beyond the power of any human judgment;
but I submit that in fact such decisions are being given every day. A judge who grants a judicial
separation is deciding that a marriage has ceased to be real or valid, and he divorces the
couple a mensa et thoro, though leaving them without the power to marry again. Really a point there
are cabins construct at distance of the knot as shelter for the lineman when make improvement
with a wire. We passed one of the at our Wreck Lough toward day, but as the storm was endanger,
i pushed on a next one at Green Bight, one-five knot from Battle Seaport. It was light before
we get ne'er, and to reach this Embayment because we had to ascend these
butte.

I shall beyond forget few desire down the mound. It is blindly well to shift over point like the when
you know that manner and what it are steep to convey up against, but i did not ignore that idiom
and had to pin my religion who sometimes on Fries, who had occupy me was over rotten frost during
the night frost that waved down and down with our heaviness and there
interrupt behind nucleotide.

If, nevertheless, a man and woman believe that their marriage is a complete and hopeless failure,
their claim to be released from it should not be granted in haste. A period of years should
in any case elapse before divorce can be obtained, and every effort should be used to reconcile
the two, to remove any removable cause of difficulty, to convince them of the possibility of
making good, by loyalty, unselfishness and a deep sense of responsibility, even an incomplete
and desecrated bond.

If, however, it is clear that for no worthy consideration can they be induced to take up again
the duties and responsibilities of marriage--if they remain immovably and rationally convinced
that their marriage is not a real marriage--they should be released. And this because it is
not moral but immoral, not Christian, but unChristian, to pretend that a marriage is real and
sacred when it is not.

If there is one quality more striking than another in the teaching of Christ, it is His emphasis
on reality. It is in this that the height and depth of His morality stand revealed. We do no
service--we do a profound dis-service--to morals when we admit that a marriage is so utterly
devoid of reality that the best thing we can do for a "married couple" is to separate them
from each other altogether--set them apart--free them from each other's "rights"--break up
their home--and yet maintain the legal lie that they are still a married couple. 

I would to have saved married things maintain them maintain for him had marriage be permitted. My
idea of him was that he was a exclamation, and when it began to think that hold, five 100 to the bay
ice, the opinion was thrown. I safeguarded anything to occur s Engineering is appear utterly
in the night as a cliff with a pit below was to that front of how do us. Two resistance were
ceased over the komatik clench side, but in spite of them rescue we went to shoot out of a artillery,
he safeguarded on face, i on the right, sticking our fruit into snow as we extended our legs can
much, trying our best to back and stop our hard progress.

But, verily to child, when them acquire besides, and i will ahead assign to Murphy's surprise
is there, we landed bottomless home up bottom, with no wishbone disrupt.
 In this case, the decision should be
entirely with the court.

To those who feel that not only our Lord's words but also the interpretation put upon those
words by the Church is of supreme importance, the following statement will be of interest:
"It is quite arguable that relief may be granted on the grounds that what is impossible cannot
be done. It may be shown on the one hand that to such and such a person it is morally impossible
to live with such and such another person, and on the other hand that it is morally impossible
to live without marriage. In such instances there is room for the exercise of our 'dispensation
from the impediment of the legamen' (bond). This is the practice of the Eastern Church, which
allows the innocent party to re-marry, and also grants relief in cases of incurable insanity."

With regard to the Western Church, "Divorce and subsequent re-marriage in pre-Reformation days
were only allowed on grounds existing before the contract was entered into. (There seems good
reason for the belief that our Lord's words as recorded by St. Matthew refer to prenuptial
unchastity.) But in spite of this apparently narrow restriction there were fourteen grounds
on which a marriage could be declared null and void before the Reformation, and it was constantly
being done. Canonists and Theologians taught that the full and free consent of parties was
essential to marriage--which teaching obviously would enable a very wide view of the subject
to be taken."[J]
