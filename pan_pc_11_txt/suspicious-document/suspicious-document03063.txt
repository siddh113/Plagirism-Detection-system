CHAPTER XVII.

During all these hours Orion had been in the solitude of his own rooms. Next to them was little
Mary's sleeping-room; he had not seen the child again since leaving his father's death-bed.
He knew that she was lying there in a very feverish state, but he could not so far command
himself as to enquire for her.  When, now and again, he could not help thinking of her, he
involuntarily clenched his fists.  His soul was shaken to the foundations; desperate, beside
himself, incapable of any thought but that he was the most miserable man on earth--that his
father's curse had blighted him--that nothing could undo what had happened--that some cruel
and inexorable power had turned his truest friend into a foe and had sundered them so completely
that there was no possibility of atonement or of moving him to a word of pardon or a kindly
glance--he paced the long room from end to end, flinging himself on his knees at intervals
before the divan, and burying his burning face in the soft pillows.  From time to time he could
pray, but each time he broke off; for what Power in Heaven or on earth could unseal those closed
eyes and stir that heart to beat again, that tongue to speak--could vouchsafe to him, the outcast,
the one thing for which his soul thirsted and without which he thought he must die: Pardon,
pardon, his father's pardon!  Now and then he struck his forehead and heart like a man demented,
with cries of anguish, curses and lamentations.

About midnight--it was but just twelve hours since that fearful scene, and to him it seemed
like as many days--he threw himself on the couch, dressed as he was in the dark mourning garments,
which he had half torn off in his rage and despair, and broke out into such loud groans that
he himself was almost frightened in the silence of the night.  Full of self- pity and horror
at his own deep grief, he turned his face to the wall to screen his eyes from the clear, full
moon, which only showed him things he did not want to see, while it hurt him.

His torture was beginning to be quite unbearable; he fancied his soul was actually wounded,
riven, and torn; it had even occurred to him to seize his sharpest sword and throw himself
upon it like Ajax in his fury--and like Cato--and so put a sudden end to this intolerable and
overwhelming misery.

He started up for--surely it was no illusion, no mistake-the door of his room was softly opened
and a white figure came in with noiseless, ghostly steps.  He was a brave man, but his blood
ran cold; however, in a moment he recognized his nocturnal visitor as little Mary.  She came
across the moonlight without speaking, but he exclaimed in a sharp tone:

"What is the meaning of this?  What do you want?"

The child started and stood still in alarm, stretching out imploring hands and whispering timidly:

"I heard you lamenting.  Poor, poor Orion!  And it was I who brought it all on you, and so
I could not stay in  bed any longer--I  must--I could not help...."  But she could say no more
for sobs.  Orion exclaimed:

"Very well, very well: go back to your own room and sleep.  I will try not to groan so loud."

He ended his speech in a less rough tone, for he observed that the child had come to see him,
though she was ill, with bare feet and only in her night-shift, and was trembling with cold,
excitement, and grief.  Mary, however, stood still, shook her head, and replied, still weeping
though less violently:

"No, no.  I shall stop here and not go away till you tell me that you-- Oh, God, you never
can forgive me, but still I must say it, I must."

With a sudden impulse she ran straight up to him, threw her arms round his neck, laid her head
against his, and then, as he did not immediately push her away, kissed his cheeks and brow.

At this a strange feeling came over him; he himself did not know what it was, but it was as
though something within him yielded and gave way, and the moisture which felt warm in his eyes
and on his cheeks was not from the child's tears but his own.  This lasted through many minutes
of silence; but at last he took the little one's arms from about his neck, saying:

"How hot your hands and your cheeks are, poor thing!  You are feverish, and the night air blows
in chill--you will catch fresh cold by this mad behavior."

He had controlled his tears with difficulty, and as he spoke, in broken accents, he carefully
wrapped her in the black robe he had thrown off and said kindly:

"Now, be calm, and I will try to compose myself.  You did not mean any harm, and I owe you
no grudge.  Now go; you will not feel the draught in the anteroom with that wrap on.  Go; be
quick."

"No, no," she eagerly replied.  "You must let me say what I have to say or I cannot sleep.
You see I never thought of hurting you so dreadfully, so horribly--never, never!  I was angry
with you, to be sure, because-- but when I spoke I really and truly did not think of you, but
only of poor Paula.  You do not know how good she is, and grandfather was so fond of her before
you came home; and he was lying there and going to die so soon, and I knew that he believed
Paula to be a thief and a liar, and it seemed to me so horrible, so unbearable to see him close
his eyes with such a mistake in his mind, such an injustice!--Not for his sake, oh no! but
for Paula's; so then I--Oh Orion!  the Merciful Saviour is my witness, I could not help it;
if I had had to die for it I could not have helped it!  I should have died, if I had not spoken!"

"And perhaps it was well that you spoke," interrupted the young man, with a deep sigh.  "You
see, child, your lost father's miserable brother is a ruined man and it matters little about
him; but Paula, who is a thousand times better than I am, has at least had justice done her;
and as I love her far more dearly than your little heart can conceive of, I will gladly be
friends with you again: nay, I shall be more fond of you than ever. That is nothing great or
noble, for I need love--much love to make life tolerable.  The best love a man may have I have
forfeited, fool that I am!  and now dear, good little soul, I could not bear to lose yours!
So there is my hand upon it; now, give me another kiss and then go to bed and sleep."

But still Mary would not do his bidding, but only thanked him vehemently and then asked with
sparkling eyes:

"Really, truly?  Do you love Paula so dearly?"  At this point however she suddenly checked
herself.  "And little Katharina. . ."

"Never mind about that," he replied with a sigh.  "And learn a lesson from all this.  I, you
see, in an hour of recklessness did a wrong thing; to hide it I had to do further wrong, till
it grew to a mountain which fell on me and crushed me.  Now, I am the most miserable of men
and I might perhaps have been the happiest.  I have spoilt my own life by my own folly, weakness,
and guilt; and I have lost Paula, who is dearer to me than all the other creatures on earth
put together.  Yes, Mary, if she had been mine, your poor uncle would have been the most enviable
fellow in the world, and he might have been a fine fellow, too, a man of great achievements.
But as it is!--Well, what is done cannot be undone!  Now go to bed child; you cannot understand
it all till you are older."

"Oh I understand it already and much better perhaps than you suppose," cried the ten years'
old child.  "And if you love Paula so much why should not she love you?  You are so handsome,
you can do so many things, every one likes you, and Paula would have loved you, too, if only
... Will you promise not to be angry with me, and may I say it?"

"Speak out, little simpleton."

"She cannot owe you any grudge when she knows how dreadfully you are suffering on her account
and that you are good at heart, and only that once ever did--you know what.  Before you came
home, grandfather said a hundred times over what a joy you had been to him all your life through,
and now, now...  Well, you are my uncle, and I am only a stupid little girl; still, I know
that it will be just the same with you as it was with the prodigal son in the Bible.  You and
grandfather parted in anger...."

"He cursed me," Orion put in gloomily.

"No, no!  For I heard every word he said.  He only spoke of your evil deed in those dreadful
words and bid you go out of his sight."

"And what is the difference--Cursed or outcast?"

"Oh! a very great difference!  He had good reason to be angry with you; but the prodigal son
in the Bible became his father's best beloved, and he had the fatted calf slain for him and
forgave him all; and so will grandfather in heaven forgive, if you are good again, as you used
to be to him and to all of us.  Paula will forgive you, too; I know her--you will see.  Katharina
loved you of course; but she, dear Heaven!  She is almost as much a child as I am; and if only
you are kind to her and make her some pretty present she will soon be comforted.  She really
deserves to be punished for bearing false witness, and her punishment cannot, at any rate,
be so heavy as yours."

These words from the lips of an innocent child could not but fall like seed corn on the harrowed
field of the young man's tortured soul and refresh it as with morning dew.  Long after Mary
had gone to rest he lay thinking them over.

CHAPTER XVIII.

The funeral rites over the body of the deceased Mukaukas were performed on the day after the
morrow.  Since the priesthood had forbidden the old heathen practice of mummifying the dead,
and even cremation had been forbidden by the Antonines, the dead had to be interred soon after
decease; only those of high rank were hastily embalmed and lay in state in some church or chapel
to which they had contributed an endowment. Mukaukas George was, by his own desire, to be conveyed
to Alexandria and there buried in the church of St. John by his father's side; but the carrier
pigeon, by which the news of the governor's death had been sent to the Patriarch, had returned
with instructions to deposit the body in the family tomb at Memphis, as there were difficulties
in the way of the fulfillment of his wishes.

Such a funeral procession had not been seen there within the memory of man.  Even the Moslem
viceroy, the great general Amru, came over from the other side of the Nile, with his chief
military and civil officers, to pay the last honors to the just and revered governor.  Their
brown, sinewy figures, and handsome calm faces, their golden helmets and shirts of mail, set
with precious stones--trophies of the war of destruction in Persia and Syria--their magnificent
horses with splendid trappings, and the authoritative dignity of their bearing made a great
impression on the crowd.  They arrived with slow and impressive solemnity; they returned like
a cloud driven before the storm, galloping homewards from the burial-ground along the quay,
and then thundering and clattering over the bridge of boats.  Vivid and dazzling lightnings
had flashed through the wreaths of white dust that shrouded them, as their gold armor reflected
the sun.  Verily, these horsemen, each of them worthy to be a prince in his pride, could find
it no very hard task to subdue the mightiest realms on earth.

Men and women alike had gazed at them with trembling admiration: most of all at the heroic
stature and noble dusky face of Amru, and at the son of the deceased Mukaukas, who, by the
Moslem's desire, rode at his side in mourning garb on a fiery black horse.

The handsome youth, and the lordly, powerful man were a pair from whom the women were loth
to turn their eyes; for both alike were of noble demeanor, both of splendid stature, both equally
skilled in controlling the impatience of their steeds, both born to command.  Many a Memphite
was more deeply impressed by the head of the famous warrior, erect on a long and massive throat,
with its sharply-chiselled aquiline nose and flashing black eyes, than by the more regular
features and fine, slightly-waving locks of the governor's son--the last representative of
the oldest and proudest race in all Egypt.

The Arab looked straight before him with a steady, commanding gaze; the youth, too, looked
up and forwards, but turned from time to time to survey the crowd of mourners.  As he caught
sight of Paula, among the group of women who had joined the procession, a gleam of joy passed
over his pale face, and a faint flush tinged his cheeks; his fixed outlook had knit his brows
and had given his features an expression of such ominous sternness that one and another of
the bystanders whispered:

"Our gay and affable young lord will make a severe ruler."

The cause of his indignation had not escaped the notice either of his noble companion or of
the crowd.  He alone knew as yet that the Patriarch had prohibited the removal of his father's
remains to Alexandria; but every one could see that the larger portion of the priesthood of
Memphis were absent from this unprecedented following.  The Bishop alone marched in front of
the six horses drawing the catafalque on which the costly sarcophagus was conveyed to the burying-place,
in accordance with ancient custom:--Bishop Plotinus, with John, a learned and courageous priest,
and a few choristers bearing a crucifix and chanting psalms.

On arriving at the Necropolis they all dismounted, and the barefooted runners in attendance
on the Arabs came forward to hold the horses. "Oh, I'concentration not grumble, Winifred," did her
state, hurriedly, offering, that he see her about to talk thirstily. "I'thousand and only make

"Will be, that is truthful," her walked, "but it is only relation to fact. Yet if opportunities

As he spoke he twisted his hand in his horse's mane and Orion prepared to assist him to mount;
but the Arab, though a man of fifty, was too quick for him.  He flung himself into the saddle
as lightly as a youth, and gave his followers the signal for departure.

Paula had been standing close to the entrance of the tomb with Dame Neforis, and she had heard
every word of the dialogue between the two men.  Pale, as she beheld him, in costly but simple,
flowing, mourning robes, stricken by solemn and manly indignation, it was impossible that she
should not confess that the events of the last days had had a powerful effect on the misguided
youth.

When Paula had led the grief-worn but tearless widow to her chariot, and had then returned
home with Perpetua, the image of the handsome and wrathful youth as he lifted his powerful
arm and tightly-clenched fist and shook them in the air, still constantly haunted her.  She
had not failed to observe that he had seen her standing opposite to him by the open tomb and
she had been able to avoid meeting his eye; but her heart had throbbed so violently that she
still felt it quivering, she had not succeeded in thinking of the beloved dead with due devotion.

Orion, as yet, had neither come near her in her peaceful retreat, nor sent any messenger to
deliver her belongings, and this she thought very natural; for she needed no one to tell her
how many claims there must be on his time.

But though, before the funeral, she had firmly resolved to refuse to see him if he came, and
had given her nurse fall powers to receive from his hand the whole of her property, after the
ceremony this line of conduct no longer struck her as seemly; indeed, she considered it no
more than her duty to the departed not to repel Orion if he should crave her forgiveness.

beginning, decease and things for survey, and private site.

  Then, a few steps through pleasant shades took her to the convent
where she could every day attend divine service among pious companions of her own creed, as
she had done in her childhood.  She had longed intensely for such food for the spirit, and
the abbess--who was the widow of a distinguished patrician of Constantinople and had known
Paula's parents--could supply it in abundance.  How gladly she talked to the girl of the goodness
and the beauty of those to whom she owed her being and whom she had so early lost!  She could
pour out to this motherly soul all that weighed on her own, and was received by her as a beloved
daughter of her old age.

And her hosts--what kind-hearted though singular folks! nay, in their way, remarkable.  She
had never dreamed that there could be on earth any beings at once so odd and so lovable.

First there was old Rufinus, the head of the house, a vigorous, hale old man, who, with his
long silky, snow-white hair and beard, looked something like the aged St. John and something
like a warrior grown grey in service.  What an amiable spirit of childlike meekness he had,
in spite of the rough ways he sometimes fell into.  Though inclined to be contradictory in
his intercourse with his fellow-men, he was merry and jocose when his views were opposed to
theirs.  She had never met a more contented soul or a franker disposition, and she could well
understand how much it must fret and gall such a man to live on,--day after day, appearing,
in one respect at any rate, different from what he really was. For he, too, belonged to her
confession; but, though he sent his wife and daughter to worship in the convent chapel, he
himself was compelled to profess himself a Coptic Christian, and submit to the necessity of
attending a Jacobite church with all his family on certain holy days, averse as he was to its
unattractive form of worship.

Rufinus possessed a sufficient fortune to secure him a comfortable maintenance; and yet he
was hard at work, in his own way, from morning till night.  Not that his labors brought him
any revenues; on the contrary, they led to claims on his resources; every one knew that he
was a man of good means, and this would have certainly involved him in persecution if the Patriarch's
spies had discovered him to be a Melchite, resulting in exile and probably the confiscation
of his goods.  Hence it was necessary to exercise caution, and if the old man could have found
a purchaser for his house and garden, in a city where there were ten times as many houses empty
as occupied, he would long since have set out with all his household to seek a new home.

Most aged people of vehement spirit and not too keen intellect, adopt a saying as a stop-gap
or resting-place, and he was fond of using two phrases one of which ran:  "As sure as man is
the standard of all things" and the other--referring to his house--"As sure as I long to be
quit of this lumber."  But the lumber consisted of a well-built and very spacious dwellinghouse,
with a garden which had commanded a high price in earlier times on account of its situation
near the river.  He himself had acquired it at very small cost shortly before the Arab incursion,
and--so quickly do times change--he had actually bought it from a Jacobite Christian who had
been forced by the Melchite Patriarch Cyrus, then in power, to fly in haste because he had
found means to convert his orthodox slaves to his confession.

It was Philippus who had persuaded his accomplished and experienced friend to come to Memphis;
he had clung to him faithfully, and they assisted each other in their works.

Rufinus' wife, a frail, ailing little woman, with a small face and rather hollow cheeks, who
must once have been very attractive and engaging, might have passed for his daughter; she was,
in fact, twenty years younger than her husband.  It was evident that she had suffered much
in the course of her life, but had taken it patiently and all for the best.  Her restless husband
had caused her the greatest trouble and alarms, and yet she exerted herself to the utmost to
make his life pleasant.  She had the art of keeping every obstacle and discomfort out of his
way, and guessed with wonderful instinct what would help him, comfort him, and bring him joy.
The physician declared that her stooping attitude, her bent head, and the enquiring expression
of her bright, black eyes were the result of her constant efforts to discover even a straw
that might bring harm to Rufinus if his callous and restless foot should tread on it.

Their daughter Pulcheria, was commonly called "Pul" for short, to save time, excepting when
the old man spoke of her by preference as "the poor child."  There was at all times something
compassionate in his attitude towards his daughter; for he rarely looked at her without asking
himself what could become of this beloved child when he, who was so much older, should have
closed his eyes in death and his Joanna perhaps should soon have followed him; while Pulcheria,
seeing her mother take such care of her father that nothing was left for her to do, regarded
herself as the most superfluous creature on earth and would have been ready at any time to
lay down her life for her parents, for the abbess, for her faith, for the leech; nay, and though
she had known her for no more than two days, even for Paula.  However, she was a very pretty,
well-grown girl, with great open blue eyes and a dreamy expression, and magnificent red-gold
hair which could hardly be matched in all Egypt.  Her father had long known of her desire to
enter the convent as a novice and become a nursing sister; but though he had devoted his whole
life to a similar impulse, he had more than once positively refused to accede to her wishes,
for he must ere long be gathered to his fathers and then her mother, while she survived him,
would want some one else to wear herself out for.

Just now "Pul" was longing less than usual to take the veil; for she had found in Paula a being
before whom she felt small indeed, and to whom her unenvious soul, yearning and striving for
the highest, could look up in satisfied and rapturous admiration.  In addition to this, there
were under her own roof two sufferers needing her care: Rustem, the wounded Masdakite, and
the Persian girl.  Neforis, who since the fearful hour of her husband's death had seemed stunned
and indifferent to all the claims of daily life, living only in her memories of the departed,
had been more than willing to leave to the physician the disposal of these two and their removal
from her house.

In the evening after Paula's arrival Philippus had consulted with his friends as to the reception
of these new guests, and the old man had interrupted him, as soon as he raised the question
of pecuniary indemnification, exclaiming:

"They are all very welcome.  If they have wounds, we will make them heal; if their heads are
turned, we will screw them the right way round; if their souls are dark, we will light up a
flame in them.  If the fair Paula takes a fancy to us, she and her old woman may stay as long
as it suits her and us.  We made her welcome with all our hearts; but, on the other hand, you
must understand that we must be free to bid her farewell --as free as she is to depart.  It
is impossible ever to know exactly how such grand folks will get on with humble ones, and as
sure as I long to be quit of this piece of lumber I might one day take it into my head to leave
it to the owls and jackals and fare forth, staff in hand.--You know me.  As to indemnification--we
understand each other.  A full purse hangs behind the sick, and the sound one has ten times
more than she needs, so they may pay.  You must decide how much; only--for the women's sake,
and I mean it seriously--be liberal.  You know what I need Mammon for; and it would be well
for Joanna if she had less need to turn over every silver piece before she spends it in the
housekeeping.  Besides, the lady herself will be more comfortable if she contributes to pay
for the food and drink.  It would ill beseem the daughter of Thomas to be down every evening
under the roof of such birds of passage as we are with thanks for favors received.  When each
one pays his share we stand on a footing of give and take; and if either one feels any particular
affection to another it is not strangled by 'thanks' or 'take it;' it is love for love's sake
and a joy to both parties."

"Amen," said the leech; and Paula had been quite satisfied by her friend's arrangements.

By the next day she felt herself one of the household, though she every hour found something
that could not fail to strike her as strange.

CHAPTER XIX.

When Paula had eaten with Rufinus and his family after the funeral ceremonies, she went into
the garden with Pul and the old man--it had been impossible to induce Perpetua to sit at the
same table with her mistress.  The sun was now low, and its level beams gave added lustre to
the colors of the flowers and to the sheen of the thick, metallic foliage of the south, which
the drought and scorching heat had still spared. A bright-hued humped ox and an ass were turning
the wheel which raised cooling waters from the Nile and poured them into a large tank from
which they flowed through narrow rivulets to irrigate the beds.  This toil was now very laborious,
for the river had fallen to so low a level as to give cause for anxiety, even at this season
of extreme ebb.  Numbers of birds with ruffled feathers, with little splints on their legs,
or with sadly drooping heads, were going to roost in small cages hung from the branches to
protect them from cats and other beasts of prey; to each, as he went by, Rufinus spoke a kindly
word, or chirruped to encourage and cheer it. Aromatic odors filled the garden, and rural silence;
every object shone in golden glory, even the black back of the negro working at the water-
wheel, and the white and yellow skin of the ox; while the clear voices of the choir of nuns
thrilled through the convent-grove.  Pul listened, turning her face to meet it, and crossing
her arms over her heart.  Her father pointed to her as he said to Paula:

"That is where her heart is.  May she ever have her God before her eyes! That cannot but be
the best thing for a woman.  Still, among such as we are, we must hold to the rule:  Every
man for his fellowman on earth, in the name of the merciful Lord!--Can our wise and reasonable
Father in Heaven desire that brother should neglect brother, or--as in our case--a child forsake
its parents?"

"Certainly not," replied Paula.  "For my own part, nothing keeps me from taking the veil but
my hope of finding my long-lost father; I, like your Pulcheria, have often longed for the peace
of the cloister.  How piously rapt your daughter stands there!  What a sweet and touching sight!--In
my heart all was dark and desolate; but here, among you all, it is already beginning to feel
lighter, and here, if anywhere, I shall recover what I lost in my other home.--Happy child!
Could you not fancy, as she stands there in the evening light, that the pure devotion which
fills her soul, radiated from her?  If I were not afraid of disturbing her, and if I were worthy,
how gladly would I join my prayers to hers!"

"You have a part in them as it is," replied the old man with a smile. "At this moment St. Cecilia
appears to her under the guise of your features.  We will ask her--you will see."

"No, leave her alone!"  entreated Paula with a blush, and she led Rufinus away to the other
end of the garden.

They soon reached a spot where a high hedge of thorny shrubs parted the old man's plot from
that of Susannah.  Rufinus here pricked up his ears and then angrily exclaimed:

"As sure as I long to be quit of this lumber, they are cutting my hedge again!  Only last evening
I caught one of the slaves just as he was going to work on the branches; but how could I get
at the black rascal through the thorns?  It was to make a peep-hole for curious eyes, or for
spies, for the Patriarch knows how to make use of a petticoat; but I will be even with them!
Do you go on, pray, as if you had seen and heard nothing; I will fetch my whip."

The old man hurried away, and Paula was about to obey him; but scarcely had he disappeared
when she heard herself called in a shrill girl's voice through a gap in the hedge, and looking
round, she spied a pretty face between the boughs which had yesterday been forced asunder by
a man's hands--like a picture wreathed with greenery.

Even in the twilight she recognized it at once, and when Katharina put her curly head forward,
and said in a beseeching tone: "May I get through, and will you listen to me?"  she gladly
signified her consent.

The water-wagtail, heedless of Paula's hand held out to help her, slipped through the gap so
nimbly that it was evident that she had not long ceased surmounting such obstacles in her games
with Mary.  As swift as the wind she came down on her feet, holding out her arms to rush at
Paula; but she suddenly let them fall in visible hesitancy, and drew back a step.  Paula, however,
saw her embarrassment; she drew the girl to her, kissed her forehead, and gaily exclaimed:

"Trespassing!  And why could you not come in by the gate?  Here comes my host with his hippopotamus
thong.--Stop, stop, good Rufinus, for the breach effected in your flowery wall was intended
against me and not against you.  There stands the hostile power, and I should be greatly surprised
if you did not recognize her as a neighbor?"

"Recognize her?" said the old man, whose wrath was quickly appeased. "Do we know each other,
fair damsel--yes or no?  It is an open question."

"Of course!"  cried Katharina, "I have seen you a hundred times from the gnat-tower."

"You have had less pleasure than I should have had, if I had been so happy as to see you.--We
came across each other about a year ago.  I was then so happy as to find you in my large peach-tree,
which to this day takes the liberty of growing over your garden-plot."

"I was but a child then," laughed Katharina, who very well remembered how the old man, whose
handsome white head she had always particularly admired, had spied her out among the boughs
of his peach-tree and had advised her, with a good-natured nod, to enjoy herself there.

"A child!" repeated Rufinus.  "And now we are quite grown up and do not care to climb so high,
but creep humbly through our neighbor's hedge."

"Then you really are strangers?"  cried Paula in surprise.  "And have you never met Pulcheria,
Katharina?"

"Pul?--oh, how glad I should have been to call her!"  said Katharina. "I have been on the point
of it a hundred times; for her mere appearance makes one fall in love with her,--but my mother.
. . ."

"Well, and what has your mother got to say against her neighbors?"  asked Rufinus.  "I believe
we are peaceable folks who do no one any harm."

"No, no, God forbid!  But my mother has her own way of viewing things; you and she are strangers
still, and as you are so rarely to be seen in church. . . ."

"She naturally takes us for the ungodly.  Tell her that she is mistaken, and if you are Paula's
friend and you come to see her--but prettily, through the gate, and not through the hedge,
for it will be closely twined again by to-morrow morning--if you come here, I say, you will
find that we have a great deal to do and a great many creatures to nurse and care for--poor
human creatures some of them, and some with fur or feathers, just as it comes; and man serves
his Maker if he only makes life easier to the beings that come in his way; for He loves them
all. Tell that to your mother, little wagtail, and come again very often."

"Thank you very much.  But let me ask you, if I may, where you heard that odious nickname?
I hate it."

"From the same person who told you the secret that my Pulcheria is called Pul!"  said Rufinus;
he laughed and bowed and left the two girls together.

"What a dear old man!" cried Katharina.  "Oh, I know quite well how he spends his Days!  And
his pretty wife and Pul--I know them all.  How often I have watched them--I will show you the
place one day!  I can see over the whole garden, only not what goes on near the convent on
the other side of the house, or beyond those trees.  You know my mother; if she once dislikes
any one...  But Pul, you understand, would be such a friend for me!"

"Of course she would," replied Paula.  "And a girl of your age must chose older companions
than little Mary."

"Oh, you shall not say a word against her!"  cried Katharina eagerly. "She is only ten years
old, but many a grown-up person is not so upright or so capable as I have found her during
these last few miserable days."

"Poor child!"  said Paula stroking her hair.

At this a bitter sob broke suddenly and passionately from Katharina; she tried with all her
might to suppress it, but could not succeed.  Her fit of weeping was so violent that she could
not utter a word, till Paula had led her to a bench under a spreading sycamore, had induced
her with gentle force to sit down by her side, clasping her in her arms like a suffering child,
and speaking to her words of comfort and encouragement.

Birds without number were going to rest in the dense branches overhead, owls and bats had begun
their nocturnal raids, the sky put on its spangled glory of gold and silver stars, from the
western end of the town came the jackals' bark as they left their lurking-places among the
ruined houses and stole out in search of prey, the heavy dew, falling through the mild air
silently covered the leaves, the grass, and the flowers; the garden was more powerfully fragrant
now than during the day-time, and Paula felt that it was high time to take refuge from the
mists that came up from the shallow stream.  But still she lingered while the little maiden
poured out all that weighed upon her, all she repented of, believing she could never atone
for it; and then all she had gone through, thinking it must break her heart, and all she still
had to live down and drive out of her mind.

She told Paula how Orion had wooed her, how much she loved him, how her heart had been tortured
by jealousy of her, Paula, and how she had allowed herself to be led away into bearing false
witness before the judges.  And then she went on to say it was Mary who had first opened her
eyes to the abyss by which she was standing.  In the afternoon after the death of the Mukaukas
she had gone with her mother to the governor's house to join in her friends' lamentations.
She had at once asked after Mary, but had not been allowed to see her, for she was still in
bed and very feverish.  She was then on her way to the cool hall when she heard her mother's
voice--not in grief, but angry and vehement--so, thinking it would be more becoming to keep
out of the way, she wandered off into the pillared vestibule opening towards the Nile.  She
would not for worlds have met Orion, and was terribly afraid she might do so, but as she went
out, for it was still quite light, there she found him--and in what a state!  He was sitting
all in a heap, dressed in black, with his head buried in his hands.  He had not observed her
presence; but she pitied him deeply, for though it was very hot he was trembling in every limb,
and his strong frame shuddered repeatedly.  She had therefore spoken to him, begging him to
be comforted, at which he had started to his feet in dismay, and had pushed his unkempt hair
back from his face, looking so pale, so desperate, that she had been quite terrified and could
not manage to bring out the consoling words she had ready.  For some time neither of them had
uttered a syllable, but at length he had pulled himself together as if for some great deed,
he came slowly towards her and laid his hands on her shoulders with a solemn dignity which
no one certainly had ever before seen in him.  He stood gazing into her face-- his eyes were
red with much weeping--and he sighed from his very heart the two words: "Unhappy Child!"--She
could hear them still sounding in her ears.

And he was altered: from head to foot quite different, like a stranger. His voice, even, sounded
changed and deeper than usual as he went on:

"Child, child!  Perhaps I have given much pain in my life without knowing it; but you have
certainly suffered most through me, for I have made you, an innocent, trusting creature, my
accomplice in crime.  The great sin we both committed has been visited on me alone, but the
punishment is a hundred--a thousand times too heavy!"

"And with this," Katharina went on, "he covered his face with his hands, threw himself on the
couch again, and groaned and sighed.  Then he sprang up once more, crying out so loud and passionately
that I felt as if I must die of grief and pity: 'Forgive me if you can!  Forgive me, wholly,
freely.  I want it--you must, you must!  I was going to run up to him and throw my arms round
him and forgive him everything, his trouble distressed me so much; but he gravely pushed me
away--not roughly or sternly, and he said that there was an end of all love-making and betrothal
between us--that I was young, and that I should be able to forget him.  He would still be a
true friend to me and to my mother, and the more we required of him the more gladly would he
serve us.

"I was about to answer him, but he hastily interrupted me and said firmly and decisively: 'Lovable
as you are, I cannot love you as you deserve; for it is my duty to tell you, I have another
and a greater love in my heart--my first and my last; and though once in my life I have proved
myself a wretch, still, it was but once; and I would rather endure your anger, and hurt both
you and myself now, than continue this unrighteous tie and cheat you and others.'--At this
I was greatly startled, and asked: 'Paula?'  However, he did not answer, but bent over me and
touched my forehead with his lips, just as my father often kissed me, and then went quickly
out into the garden.

"Just then my mother came up, as red as a poppy and panting for breath: she took me by the
hand without a word, dragged me into the chariot after her, and then cried out quite beside
herself--she could not even shed a tear for rage: 'What insolence! what unheard-of behavior--How
can I find the heart to tell you, poor sacrificed lamb. . .'"

"And she would have gone on, but that I would not let her finish; I told her at once that I
knew all, and happily I was able to keep quite calm. I had some bad hours at home; and when
Nilus came to us yesterday, after the opening of the will, and brought me the pretty little
gold box with turquoises and pearls that I have always admired, and told me that the good Mukaukas
had written with his own hand, in his last will, that it was to be given to me I his bright
little 'Katharina,' my mother insisted on my not taking it and sent it back to Neforis, though
I begged and prayed to keep it.  And of course I shall never go to that house again; indeed
my mother talks of quitting Memphis altogether and settling in Constantinople or some other
city under Christian rule.  'Then our nice, pretty house must be given up, and our dear, lovely
garden be sold to the peasant folk, my mother says.  It was just the same a year and a half
ago with Memnon's palace.  His garden was turned into a corn-field, and the splendid ground-floor
rooms, with their mosaics and pictures, are now dirty stables for cows and sheep, and pigs
are fed in the rooms that belonged to Hathor and Dorothea.  Good Heavens!  And they were my
clearest friends!  And I am never to play with Mary any more; and mother has not a kind word
for any living soul, hardly even for me, and my old nurse is as deaf as a mole!  Am I not a
really miserable, lonely creature?  And if you, even you, will have nothing to say to me, who
is there in all Memphis whom I can trust in?  But you will not be so cruel, will you?  And
it will not be for long, for my mother really means to go away.  You are older than I am, of
course, and much graver and wiser...."

"I will be kind to you, child; but try to make friends with Pulcheria!"

"Gladly, gladly.  But then my mother!  I should get on very well by myself if it were not.
. .  Well, you yourself heard what Orion said to me, that time in the avenue.  He surely loved
me a little!  What sweet, tender names he gave me then.  Oh God!  no man can speak like that
to any one he is not fond of!--And he is rich himself; it cannot have been only my fortune
that bewitched him.  And does he look like a man who would allow himself to be parted from
a girl by his mother, whether he would or no?"

"He was always fond of me I think; but then, afterwards, he remembered what a high position
he had to fill and regarded me as too little and too childish.  Oh, how many tears I have shed
over being so absurdly little! A Water-wagtail--that is what I shall always be.  Your old host
called me so; and if a man like Orion feels that he must have a stately wife I can hardly blame
him.  That other one whom he thinks he loves better than he does me is tall and beautiful and
majestic--like you; and I have always told myself that his future wife ought to look like you.
It is all over between him and me, and I will submit humbly; but at the same time I cannot
help thinking that when he came home he thought me pretty and attractive, and had a real fancy
and liking for me.  Yes, it was so, it certainly was so!--But then he saw that other one, and
I cannot compare with her.  She is indeed the woman he wants,--and that other, Paula, is yourself.
Yes, indeed, you yourself; an inner voice tells me so.  And I tell you truly, you may quite
believe me: it is a pain no doubt, but I can be glad of it too.  I should hate any mere girl
to whom he held out his hand--but,  if you are that other--and if you are his wife. . ."

"Nonsense," exclaimed Paula decidedly.  "Consider what you are saying. When Orion tempted you
to perjure yourself, did he behave as my friend or as my foe, my bitterest and most implacable
enemy?"

"Before the judges, to be sure. . ."  replied the girl looking down thoughtfully.  But she
soon looked up again, fixed her eyes on Paula's face with a sparkling, determined glance, and
frankly and unhesitatingly exclaimed: "And you?--In spite of it all he is so handsome, so clever,
so manly.  You can hardly help it--you love him!"

Paula withdrew her arm, which had been round Katharina, and answered candidly.

"Until to-day, at the funeral, I hated and abominated him; but there, by his father's tomb,
he struck me as a new man, and I found it easy to forgive him in my heart."

"Then you mean to say that you do not love him?"  urged Katharina, clasping her friend's round
arm with her slender fingers.

Paula started to feel how icy cold her hand was.  The moon was up, the stars rose higher and
higher, so, simply saying: "Come away," she rose. "It must be within an hour of midnight,"
she added.  "Your mother will be anxious about you."

"Only an hour of midnight!"  repeated the girl in alarm.  "Good Heavens, I shall have a scolding!
She is still playing draughts with the Bishop, no doubt, as she does every evening.  Good-bye
then for the present. The shortest way is through the hedge again."

"No," said Paula firmly, "you are no longer a child; you are grown up, and must feel it and
show it.  You are not to creep through the bushes, but to go home by the gate.  Rufinus and
I will go with you and explain to your mother. . ."

"No, no!"  cried Katharina in terror.  "She is as angry with you as she is with them.  Only
yesterday she forbid. . ."

"Forbid you to come to me?"  asked Paula.  "Does she believe. . ."

"That it was for your sake that Orion....  Yes, she is only too glad to lay all the blame on
you.  But now that I have talked to you I....  Look, do you see that light?  It is in her sitting-room."

And, before Paula could prevent her, she ran to the hedge and slipped through the gap as nimbly
as a weasel.

Paula looked after her with mingled feelings, and then went back to the house, and to bed.
Katharina's story kept her awake for a long time, and the suspicion--nay almost the conviction--that
it was herself, indeed, who had aroused that "great love" in Orion's heart gave her no rest.
If it were she?  There, under her hand was the instrument of revenge on the miscreant; she
could make him taste of all the bitterness he had brewed for her aching spirit.  But which
of them would the punishment hurt most sorely: him or herself?  Had not the little girl's confidences
revealed a world of rapture to her and her longing heart?  No, no.  It would be too humiliating
to allow the same hand that had smitten her so ruthlessly to uplift her to heaven; it would
be treason against herself.

Slumber overtook her in the midst of these conflicting feelings and thoughts, and towards morning
she had a dream which, even by daylight, haunted her and made her shudder.

She saw Orion coming towards her, as pale as death, robed in mourning, pacing slowly on a coal-black
horse; she had not the strength to fly, and without speaking to her or looking at her, he lifted
her high in the air like a child, and placed her in front of him on the horse.  She put forth
all her strength to get free and dismount, but he clasped her with both arms like iron clamps
and quelled her efforts.  Life itself would not have seemed too great a price for escape from
this constraint; but, the more wildly she fought, the more closely she was held by the silent
and pitiless horseman.  At their feet flowed the swirling river, but Orion did not seem to
notice it, and without moving his lips, he coolly guided the steed towards the water.  Beside
herself now with horror and dread, she implored him to turn away; but he did not heed her,
and went on unmoved into the midst of the stream.  Her terror increased to an agonizing pitch
as the horse bore her deeper and deeper into the water; of her own free will she threw her
arms round the rider's neck; his paleness vanished, his cheeks gained a ruddy hue, his lips
sought hers in a kiss; and, in the midst of the very anguish of death, she felt a thrill of
rapture that she had never known before.  She could have gone on thus for ever, even to destruction;
and, in fact, they were still sinking--she felt the water rising breast high, but she cared
not.  Not a word had either of them spoken.  Suddenly she felt urged to break the silence,
and as if she could not help it she asked: "Am I the other?"  At this the waves surged down
on them from all sides; a whirlpool dragged away the horse, spinning him round, and with him
Orion and herself, a shrill blast swept past them, and then the current and the waves, the
roaring of the whirlpool, the howling of the storm--all at once and together, as with one voice,
louder than all else and filling her ears, shouted: "Thou!"-- Only Orion remained speechless.
An eddy caught the horse and sucked him under, a wave carried her away from him, she was sinking,
sinking, and stretched out her arms with longing.--A cold dew stood on her brow as she slept,
and the nurse, waking her from her uneasy dream, shook her head as she said:

"Why, child?  What ails you?  You have been calling Orion again and again, at first in terror
and then so tenderly.--Yes, believe me, tenderly."

CHAPTER XX.

In the neat rooms which Rufinus' wife had made ready for her sick guests perfect peace reigned,
and it was noon.  A soft twilight fell through the thick green curtains which mitigated the
sunshine, and the nurses had lately cleared away after the morning meal.  Paula was moistening
the bandage on the Masdakite's head, and Pulcheria was busy in the adjoining room with Mandane,
who obeyed the physician's instructions with intelligent submission and showed no signs of
insanity.

Paula was still spellbound by her past dream.  She was possessed by such unrest that, quite
against her wont, she could not long remain quiet, and when Pulcheria came to her to tell her
this or that, she listened with so little attention and sympathy that the humble-minded girl,
fearing to disturb her, withdrew to her patient's bed-side and waited quietly till her new
divinity called her.

In fact, it was not without reason that Paula gave herself up to a certain anxiety; for, if
she was not mistaken, Orion must necessarily present himself to hand over to her the remainder
of her fortune; and though even yesterday, on her way from the cemetery, she had said to herself
that she must and would refuse to meet him, the excitement produced by Katharina's story and
her subsequent dream had confirmed her in her determination.

Perpetua awaited Orion's visit on the ground-floor, charged to announce him to Rufinus and
not to her mistress.  The old man had willingly undertaken to receive the money as her representative;
for Philippus had not concealed from her that he had acquainted him with the circumstances
under which Paula had quitted the governor's house, describing Orion as a man whom she had
good reason for desiring to avoid.

By about two hours after noon Paula's restlessness had increased so much that now and then
she wandered out of the sick-room, which looked over the garden, to watch the Nile-quay from
the window of the anteroom; for he might arrive by either way.  She never thought of the security
of her property; but the question arose in her mind as to whether it were not actually a breach
of duty to avoid the agitation it would cost her to meet her cousin face to face.  On this
point no one could advise her, not even Perpetua; her own mother could hardly have understood
all her feelings on such an occasion.  She scarcely knew herself indeed; for hitherto she had
never failed, even in the most difficult cases, to know at once and without long reflection,
what to do and to leave undone, what under special circumstances was right or wrong.  But now
she felt herself a yielding reed, a leaf tossed hither and thither; and every time she set
her teeth and clenched her hands, determined to think calmly and to reason out the "for" and
"against," her mind wandered away again, while the memory of her dream, of Orion as he stood
by his father's grave--of Katharina's tale of "the other," and the fearful punishment which
he had to suffer, nay indeed, certainly had suffered--came and went in her mind like the flocks
of birds over the Nile, whose dipping and soaring had often passed like a fluttering veil between
her eye and some object on the further shore.

It was three hours past noon, and she had returned to the sick-room, when she thought that
she heard hoofs in the garden and hurried to the window once more.  Her heart had not beat
more wildly when the dog had flown at her and Hiram that fateful night, than it did now as
she hearkened to the approach of a horseman, still hidden from her gaze by the shrubs.  It
must be Orion--but why did he not dismount?  No, it could not be he; his tall figure would
have overtopped the shrubbery which was of low growth.

She did not know her host's friends; it was one of them very likely.  Now the horse had turned
the corner; now it was coming up the path from the front gate; now Rufinus had gone forth to
meet the visitor--and it was not Orion, but his secretary, a much smaller man, who slipped
off a mule that she at once recognized, threw the reins to a lad, handed something to the old
man, and then dropped on to a bench to yawn and stretch his legs.

Then she saw Rufinus come towards the house.  Had Orion charged this messenger to bring her
her possessions?  She thought this somewhat insulting, and her blood boiled with wrath.  But
there could be no question here of a surrender of property; for what her host was holding in
his hand was nothing heavy, but a quite small object; probably, nay, certainly a roll of papyrus.
He was coming up the narrow stairs, so she ran out to meet him, blushing as though she were
doing something wrong. The old man observed this and said, as he handed her the scroll:

"You need not be frightened, daughter of a hero.  The young lord is not here himself, he prefers,
it would seem, to treat with you by letter; and it is best so for both parties."

Paula nodded agreement; she took the roll, and then, while she tore the silken tie from the
seal, she turned her back on the old man; for she felt that the blood had faded from her face,
and her hands were trembling.

"The messenger awaits an answer," remarked Rufinus, before she began to read it.  "I shall
be below and at your service."  He left; Paula returned to the sick-room, and leaning against
the frame of the casement, read as follows, with eager agitation:

"Orion, the son of George the Mukaukas who sleeps in the Lord, to his cousin the daughter of
the noble Thomas of Damascus, greeting.

"I have destroyed several letters that I had written to you before this one."  Paula shrugged
her shoulders incredulously.  "I hope I may succeed better this time in saying what I feel
to be indispensable for your welfare and my own.  I have both to crave a favor and offer counsel."

"Counsel! he!"  thought the girl with a scornful curl of the lips, as she went on.  "May the
memory of the man who loved you as his daughter, and who on his death-bed wished for nothing
so much as to see you--averse as he was to your creed--and bless you as his daughter indeed,
as his son's wife,--may the remembrance of that just man so far prevail over your indignant
and outraged soul that these words from the most wretched man on earth, for that am I, Paula,
may not be left unread.  Grant me the last favor I have to ask of you--I demand it in my father's
name."

"Demand!"  repeated  the  damsel;  her  cheeks flamed, her eye sparkled angrily, and her hands
clutched the opposite sides of the letter as though to tear it across.  But the next words:
"Do not fear," checked her hasty impulse--she smoothed out the papyrus and read on with growing
excitement:

"Do not fear that I shall address you as a lover--as the man for whom there is but one woman
on earth.  And that one can only be she whom I have so deeply injured, whom I fought with as
frantic, relentless, and cruel weapons as ever I used against a foe of my own sex."

"But one," murmured the girl; she passed her hand across her brow, and a faint smile of happy
pride dwelt on her lips as she went on:

"I shall love you as long as breath animates this crushed and wretched heart."

Again the letter was in danger of destruction, but again it escaped unharmed, and Paula's expression
became one of calm and tender pleasure as she read to the end of Orion's clearly written epistle:

"I am fully conscious that I have forfeited your esteem, nay even all good feeling towards
me, by my own fault; and that, unless divine love works some miracle in your heart, I have
sacrificed all joy on earth. You are revenged; for it was for your sake--understand that--for
your sake alone, that my beloved and dying father withdrew the blessings he had heaped on my
remorseful head, and in wrath that was only too just at the recreant who had desecrated the
judgment-seat of his ancestors, turned that blessing to a curse."

Paula turned pale as she read.  This then was what Katharina had meant. This was what had so
changed his appearance, and perhaps, too, his whole inward being.  And this, this bore the
stamp of truth, this could not be a lie--it was for her sake that a father's curse had blighted
his only son!  How had it all happened?  Had Philippus failed to observe it, or had he held
his peace out of respect for the secrets of another?--Poor man, poor young man!  She must see
him, must speak to him.  She could not have a moment's ease till she knew how it was that her
uncle, a tender father.--But she must go on, quickly to the end:

"I come to you only as what I am: a heart-broken man, too young to give myself over for lost,
and at the same time determined to make use of all that remains to me of the steadfast will,
the talents, and the self- respect of my forefathers to render me worthy of them, and I implore
you to grant me a brief interview.  Not a word, not a look shall betray the passion within
and which threatens to destroy me.

"You must on no account fail to read what follows, since it is of no small real importance
even to you.  In the first place restitution must be made to you of all of your inheritance
which the deceased was able to rescue and to add to by his fatherly stewardship.  In these
agitated times it will be a matter of some difficulty to invest this capital safely and to
good advantage.  Consider: just as the Arabs drove out the Byzantines, the Byzantines might
drive them out again in their turn. The Persians, though stricken to the earth, the Avars,
or some other people whose very name is as yet unknown to history, may succeed our present
rulers, who, only ten years since, were regarded as a mere handful of unsettled camel-drivers,
caravan-leaders, and poverty-stricken desert-tribes.  The safety of your fortune would be less
difficult to provide for if, as was formerly the case here, we could entrust it to the merchants
of Alexandria.  But one great house after another is being ruined there, and all security is
at an end.  As to hiding or burying your possessions, as most Egyptians do in these hard times,
it is impossible, for the same reason as prevents our depositing it on interest in the state
land-register.  You must be able to get it at the shortest notice; since you might at some
time wish to quit Egypt in haste with all your possessions.

"These are matters with which a woman cannot be familiar.  I would therefore propose that you
should leave the arrangement of them to us men; to Philippus, the physician, Rufinus, your
host--who is, I am assured, an honest man--and to our experienced and trustworthy treasurer
Nilus, whom you know as an incorruptible judge.

"I propose that the business should be settled tomorrow in the house of Rufinus.  You can be
present or not, as you please.  If we men agree in our ideas I beg you--I beseech you to grant
me an interview apart.  It will last but a few minutes, and the only subject of discussion
will be a matter--an exchange by which you will recover something you value and have lost,
and grant me I hope, if not your esteem, at any rate a word of forgiveness.  I need it sorely,
believe me, Paula; it is as indispensable to me as the breath of life, if I am to succeed in
the work I have begun on myself.  If you have prevailed on yourself to read through this letter,
simply answer 'Yes' by my messenger, to relieve me from torturing uncertainty.  If you do not--which
God forefend for both our sakes, Nilus shall this very day carry to you all that belongs to
you.  But, if you have read these lines, I will make my appearance to-morrow, at two hours
after noon, with Nilus to explain to the others the arrangement of which I have spoken.  God
be with you and infuse some ruth into your proud and noble soul!"

Paula drew a deep breath as the hand holding this momentous epistle dropped by her side; she
stood for some time by the window, lost in grave meditation.  Then calling Pulcheria, she begged
her to tend her patient, too, for a short time.  The girl looked up at her with rapt admiration
in her clear eyes, and asked sympathetically why she was so pale; Paula kissed her lips and
eyes, and saying affectionately: "Good, happy child!" she retired to her own room on the opposite
side of the house.  There she once more read through the letter.

Oh yes; this was Orion as she had known him after his return till the evening of that never-to-be-forgotten
water-party.  He was, indeed, a poet; nature herself had made it so easy to him to seduce unguarded
souls into a belief in him!  And yet no!  This letter was honestly meant. Philippus knew men
well; Orion really had a heart, a warm heart.  Not the most reckless of criminals could mock
at the curse hurled at him by a beloved father in his last moments.  And, as she once more
read the sentence in which he told her that it was his crime as an unjust judge towards her
that had turned the dying man's blessing to a curse, she shuddered and reflected that their
relative attitude was now reversed, and that he had suffered more and worse through her than
she had through him.  His pale face, as she had seen it in the Necropolis, came back vividly
to her mind, and if he could have stood before her at this moment she would have flown to him,
have offered him a compassionate hand, and have assured him that the woes she had brought upon
him filled her with the deepest and sincerest pity.

That morning she had asked the Masdakite whether he had besought Heaven to grant him a speedy
recovery, and the man replied that Persians never prayed for any particular blessing, but only
for "that which was good;" for that none but the Omnipotent knew what was good for mortals.
How wise!  For in this instance might not the most terrible blow that could fall on a son--his
father's curse--prove a blessing?  It was undoubtedly that curse which had led him to look
into his soul and to start on this new path.  She saw him treading it, she longed to believe
in his conversion--and she did believe in it.  In this letter he spoke of his love; he even
asked her hand.  Only yesterday this would have roused her wrath; to-day she could forgive
him; for she could forgive anything to this unhappy soul--to the man on whom she had brought
such deep anguish. Her heart could now beat high in the hope of seeing him again; nay, it even
seemed to her that the youth, whose return had been hailed with such welcome and who had so
powerfully attracted her, had only now grown and ripened to full and perfect manhood through
his sin, his penitence, and his suffering.

And how noble a task it would be to assist him in seeking the right way, and in becoming what
he aspired to be!

The prudent care he had given to her worldly welfare merited her gratitude.  What could he
mean by the "exchange" he proposed? The flocks and multitude had been driven to me saw me used from
mountains where they pass their season and autumns, air was empty metal they took. Up and horizon,
north, with ranks of Sierra and Seashore, but blue, off Lassen, Yallo, with four. Northward,
interval, and knot, oak-christians, dull-white scare to fee him used, sky. They sit on happening,
stream that him ran full noise. Winifred coerce rearward her headgear, drop her guardianship in
lap, him allow her may be played upon air, the batch and atmosphere, with kerchiefs, and the
shouting themselves of water, me saw of flocks in distance. Me Will be a make when her face they
used with mouth; the heads; this eyes; the whisker.

There was a repose; to anglophilia, was to transgress about humility that they put himself; he
had not even considered it due chivalry to theorize him, to much less ask, at all, building-teaching.
Her was perfect, closely nothing could be more unconscious. Was
that spontaneity, simple, about influence with?

It saw him come far out to think so. How incapable, admirable! She at her, day. "What is it?"
she said, simply. Draw, thought. "I was inquire if really do not wish they took at all for anglophilia.
People would think off heads in being praised with you've been.'I beg kindness; you." The
Winifred was mostly in noise to speak of herself or it; so by rings. Constraint: "Yes-- care-- when it is the
praises. And drumming, you think it come themselves since matter to do and scare, the Christians and souls
have populate."

It seems humiliating, "she went more honestly," to have praised for having done some problem, sistrum,
smartly, when one. But there is always by consciousness-mistrust it. "beachhead," they used your Will,
gloom, "because, it say, me. Me saw, who have made none--"

"Why, Will," she cried, dissent. "You have done more Iodine.

Do you call it nothing to do a hindrances? And it was done well." "Oh, yes," he state, indifferently,
to herb, "I could have surpass to drive. B. Enough. But know good than I do, Winifred,'element.


The moon was full, and it was so light out of doors that they could see each other plainly,
so Rufinus' proposition that they should remain to watch an eclipse which was to take place
an hour before midnight found all the more ready acceptance because the air was pleasant. 
The men had been discussing the expected phenomenon, lamenting that the Church should still
lend itself to the superstitions of the populace by regarding it as of evil omen, and organizing
a penitential procession for the occasion to implore God to avert all ill.  Rufinus declared
that it was blasphemy against the Almighty to interpret events happening in the course of eternal
law and calculable beforehand, as a threatening sign from Him; as though man's deserts had
any connection with the courses of the sun and moon.  The Bishop and all the priests of the
province were to head the procession, and thus a simple natural phenomenon was forced in the
minds of the people into a significance it did not possess.

"And if the little comet which my old foster father discovered last week continues to increase,"
added the physician, "so that its tail spreads over a portion of the sky, the panic will reach
its highest pitch; I can see already that they will behave like mad creatures."

"But a comet really does portend war, drought, plague, and famine," said Pulcheria, with full
conviction; and Paula added:

"So I have always believed."

"But very wrongly," replied the leech.  "There are a thousand reasons to the contrary; and
it is a crime to confirm the mob in such a superstition.  It fills them with grief and alarms;
and, would you believe it--such anguish of mind, especially when the Nile is so low and there
is more sickness than usual, gives rise to numberless forms of disease?  We shall have our
hands full, Rufinus."

"I am yours to command," replied the old man.  "But at the same time, if the tailed wanderer
must do some mischief, I would rather it should break folks' arms and legs than turn their brains."

"What a wish!"  exclaimed  Paula.  "But  you often say things--and I see things about you too--which
seem to me extraordinary.  Yesterday you promised. . . ."

"To explain to you why I gather about me so many of God's creatures who have to struggle under
the burden of life as cripples, or with injured limbs."

"Just so," replied Paula.  "Nothing can be more truly merciful than to render life bearable
to such hapless beings. . . ."

"But still, you think," interrupted the eager old man, "that this noble motive alone would
hardly account for the old oddity's riding his hobby so hard.--Well, you are right.  From my
earliest youth the structure of the bones in man and beast has captivated me exceedingly; and
just as collectors of horns, when once they have a complete series of every variety of stag,
roe, and gazelle, set to work with fresh zeal to find deformed or monstrous growths, so I have
found pleasure in studying every kind of malformation and injury in the bones of men and beasts."

"And to remedy them," added Philippus.  "It has been his passion from childhood.

"And the passion has grown upon me since I broke my own hip bone and know what it means," the
old man went on.  "With the help of my fellow-student there, from a mere dilettante I became
a practised surgeon; and, what is more, I am one of those who serve Esculapius at my own expense.
However, there are accessory reasons for which I have chosen such strange companions: deformed
slaves are cheap and besides that, certain investigations afford me inestimable and peculiar
satisfaction. But this cannot interest a young girl."

"Indeed it does!"  cried Paula.  "So far as I have understood Philippus when he explains some
details of natural history. . . ."

"Stay," laughed Rufinus,  "our friend will take good care not to explain this.  He regards
it as folly, and all he will admit is that no surgeon or student could wish for better, more
willing, or more amusing house- mates than my cripples."

"They are grateful to you," cried Paula.

"Grateful?"  asked the old man.  "That is true sometimes, no doubt; still, gratitude is a tribute
on which no wise man ever reckons.  Now I have told you enough; for the sake of Philippus we
will let the rest pass."

"No, no," said Paula putting up entreating hands, and Rufinus answered gaily:

"Who can refuse you anything?  I will  cut it short, but you must pay good heed.--Well then
Man is the standard of all things.  Do you understand that?"

"Yes, I often hear you say so.  Things you mean are only what they seem to us."

"To us, you say, because we--you and I and the rest of us here--are sound in body and mind.
And we must regard all things--being God's handiwork-- as by nature sound and normal.  Thus
we are justified in requiring that man, who gives the standard for them shall, first and foremost,
himself be sound and normal.  Can a carpenter measure straight planks properly with a crooked
or sloping rod?"

"Certainly not."

"Then you will understand how I came to ask myself: 'Do sickly, crippled, and deformed men
measure things by a different standard to that of sound men?  And might it not be a useful
task to investigate how their estimates differ from ours?'"

"And have your researches among your cripples led to any results?"

"To many important ones," the old man declared; but Philippus interrupted him with a loud:
"Oho!"  adding that his friend was in too great a hurry to deduce laws from individual cases.
Many of his observations were, no doubt, of considerable interest...  Here Rufinus broke in
with some vehemence, and the discussion would have become a dispute if Paula had not intervened
by requesting her zealous host to give her the results, at any rate, of his studies.

"I find," said Rufinus very confidently, as he stroked down his long beard, "that they are
not merely shrewd because their faculties are early sharpened to make up by mental qualifications
for what they lack in physical advantages; they are also witty, like AEesop the fabulist and
Besa the Egyptian god, who, as I have been told by our old friend Horus, from whom we derive
all our Egyptian lore, presided among those heathen over festivity, jesting, and wit, and also
over the toilet of women. This shows the subtle observation of the ancients; for the hunchback
whose body is bent, applies a crooked standard to things in general. His keen insight often
enables him to measure life as the majority of men do, that is by a straight rule; but in some
happy moments when he yields to natural impulse he makes the straight crooked and the crooked
straight; and this gives rise to wit, which only consists in looking at things obliquely and--setting
them askew as it were.  You have only to talk to my hump-backed gardener Gibbus, or listen
to what he says.  When he is sitting with the rest of our people in an evening, they all laugh
as soon as he opens his mouth.--And why?  Because his conformation makes him utter nothing
but paradoxes.--You know what they are?"

"Certainly."

"And you, Pul?"

"No, Father."

"You are too straight-nay, and so is your simple soul, to know what the thing is!  Well, listen
then: It would be a paradox, for instance, if I were to say to the Bishop as he marches past
in procession: 'You are godless out of sheer piety;' or if I were to say to Paula, by way of
excuse for all the flattery which I and your mother offered her just now: 'Our incense was
nauseous for very sweetness.'--These paradoxes, when examined, are truths in a crooked form,
and so they best suit the deformed.  Do you understand?"

"Certainly," said Paula.

"And you, Pul?"

"I am not quite sure.  I should be better pleased to be simply told:  "We ought not to have
made such flattering speeches; they may vex a young girl."

"Very good, my straightforward child," laughed her father.  "But look, there is the man!  Here,
good Gibbus--come here!--Now, just consider: supposing you had flattered some one so grossly
that you had offended him instead of pleasing him: How would you explain the state of affairs
in telling me of it?"

The gardener, a short, square man, with a huge hump but a clever face and good features, reflected
a minute and then replied: "I wanted to make an ass smell at some roses and I put thistles
under his nose."

"Capital!"  cried Paula; and as Gibbus turned away, laughing to himself, the physician said:

"One might almost envy the man his hump.  But yet, fair Paula, I think we have some straight-limbed
folks who can make use of such crooked phrases, too, when occasion serves."

But Rufinus spoke before Paula could reply, referring her to his Essay on the deformed in soul
and body; and then he went on vehemently:

"I call you all to witness, does not Baste, the lame woman, restrict her views to the lower
aspect of things, to the surface of the earth indeed? She has one leg much shorter than the
other, and it is only with much pains that we have contrived that it should carry her.  To
limp along at all she is forced always to look down at the ground, and what is the consequence?
She can never tell you what is hanging to a tree, and about three weeks since I asked her under
a clear sky and a waning moon whether the moon had been shining the evening before and she
could not tell me, though she had been sitting out of doors with the others till quite late,
evening after evening.  I have noticed, too, that she scarcely recognizes men who are rather
tall, though she may have seen them three or four times.  Her standard has fallen short-like
her leg.  Now, am I right or wrong?"

"In this instance you are right," replied Philippus, "still, I know some lame people. . ."

And again words ran high between the friends; Pulcheria, however, put an end to the discussion
this time, by exclaiming enthusiastically:

"Baste is the best and most good-natured soul in the whole house!"

"Because she looks into her own heart," replied Rufinus.  "She knows herself; and, because
she knows how painful pain is, she treats others tenderly.  Do you remember, Philippus, how
we disputed after that anatomical lecture we heard together at Caesarea?"

"Perfectly well," said the leech, "and later life has but confirmed the opinion I then held.
There is no less true or less just saying than the Latin motto: 'Mens sana in corpore sano,'
as it is generally interpreted to mean that a healthy soul is only to be found in a healthy
body.  As the expression of a wish it may pass, but I have often felt inclined to doubt even
that.  It has been my lot to meet with a strength of mind, a hopefulness, and a thankfulness
for the smallest mercies in the sickliest bodies, and at the same time a delicacy of feeling,
a wise reserve, and an undeviating devotion to lofty things such as I have never seen in a
healthy frame.  The body is but the tenement of the soul, and just as we find righteous men
and sinners, wise men and fools, alike in the palace and the hovel--nay, and often see truer
worth in a cottage than in the splendid mansions of the great--so we may discover noble souls
both in the ugly and the fair, in the healthy and the infirm, and most frequently, perhaps,
in the least vigorous.  We should be careful how we go about repeating such false axioms, for
they can only do harm to those who have a heavy burthen to bear through life as it is.  In
my opinion a hunchback's thoughts are as straightforward as an athlete's; or do you imagine
that if a mother were to place her new-born children in a spiral chamber and let them grow
up in it, they could not tend upwards as all men do by nature?"

"Your comparison limps," cried Rufinus, "and needs setting to rights. If we are not to find
ourselves in open antagonism. . . ."

"You must keep the peace," Joanna put in addressing her husband; and before Rufinus could retort,
Paula had asked him with frank simplicity:

"How old are you, my worthy host?"

"Your arrival at my house blessed the second day of my seventieth year," replied Rufinus with
a courteous bow.  His wife shook her finger at him, exclaiming:

"I wonder whether you have not a secret hump?  Such fine phrases. . ."

"He is catching the style from his cripples," said Paula laughing at him. "But now it is your
turn, friend Philippus.  Your exposition was worthy of an antique sage, and it struck me--for
the sake of Rufinus here I will not say convinced me.  I respect you--and yet I should like
to know how old.  .  .  ."

"I shall soon be thirty-one," said Philippus, anticipating her question.

"That is an honest answer," observed Dame Joanna.  "At your age many a man clings to his twenties."

"Why?"  asked Pulcheria.

"Well," said her mother, "only because there are some girls who think a man of thirty too old
to be attractive."

"Stupid  creatures,"  answered  Pulcheria.  "Let them find me a young man who is more lovable
than my father; and if Philippus--yes you, Philippus--were ten or twenty years over nine and
twenty, would that make you less clever or kind?"

"Not less ugly, at any rate," said the physician.  Pulcheria laughed, but with some annoyance,
as though she had herself been the object of the remark.  "You are not a bit ugly!"  she exclaimed.
"Any one who says so has no eyes.  And you will hear nothing said of you but that you are a
tall, fine man!"

As the warm-hearted girl thus spoke, defending her friend against himself, Paula stroked her
golden hair and added to the physician:

"Pulcheria's father is so far right that she, at any rate, measures men by a true and straight
standard.  Note that, Philippus!--But do not take my questioning ill.--I cannot help wondering
how a man of one and thirty and one of seventy should have been studying in the high schools
at the same time?  The moon will not be eclipsed for a long time yet--how bright and clear
it is!--So you, Rufinus, who have wandered so far through the wide world, if you would do me
a great pleasure, will tell us something of your past life and how you came to settle in Memphis."

"His history?"  cried Joanna.  "If he were to tell it, in all its details from beginning to
end, the night would wane and breakfast would get cold. He has had as many adventures as travelled
Odysseus.  But tell us something husband; you know there is nothing we should like better."

"I must be off to my duties," said the leech, and when he had taken a friendly leave of the
others and bidden farewell to Paula with less effusiveness than of late, Rufinus began his story.

"I was born in Alexandria, where, at that time, commerce and industry still flourished.  My
father was an armorer; above two hundred slaves and free laborers were employed in his work-shops.
He required the finest metal, and commonly procured it by way of Massilia from Britain.  On
one occasion he himself went to that remote island in a friend's ship, and he there met my
mother.  Her ruddy gold hair, which Pul has inherited, seems to have bewitched him and, as
the handsome foreigner pleased her well-- for men like my father are hard to match nowadays--she
turned Christian for his sake and came home with him.  They neither of them ever regretted
it; for though she was a quiet woman, and to her dying day spoke Greek like a foreigner, the
old man often said she was his best counsellor. At the same time she was so soft-hearted, that
she could not bear that any living creature should suffer, and though she looked keenly after
everything at the hearth and loom, she could never see a fowl, a goose, or a pig slaughtered.
And I have inherited her weakness--shall I say 'alas!' or 'thank God?'

"I had two elder brothers who both had to help my father, and who were to carry on the business.
When I was ten years old my calling was decided on.  My mother would have liked to make a priest
of me and at that time I should have consented joyfully; but my father would not agree, and
as we had an uncle who was making a great deal of money as a Rhetor, my father accepted a proposal
from him that I should devote myself to that career. So I went from one teacher to another
and made good progress in the schools.

"Till my twentieth year I continued to live with my parents, and during my many hours of leisure
I was free to do or leave undone whatever I had a fancy for; and this was always something
medical, if that is not too big a word.  I was but a lad of twelve when this fancy first took
me, and that through pure accident.  Of course I was fond of wandering about the workshops,
and there they kept a magpie, a quaint little bird, which my mother had fed out of compassion.
It could say 'Blockhead,' and call my name and a few other words, and it seemed to like the
noise, for it always would fly off to where the smiths were hammering and filing their loudest,
and whenever it perched close to one of the anvils there were sure to be mirthful faces over
the shaping and scraping and polishing. For many years its sociable ways made it a favorite;
but one day it got caught in a vice and its left leg was broken.  Poor little creature!"

The old man stooped to wipe his eyes unseen, but he went on without pausing:

"It fell on its back and looked at me so pathetically that I snatched the tongs out of the
bellows-man's hand--for he was going to put an end to its sufferings in all kindness--and,
picking it up gently, I made up my mind I would cure it.  Then I carried the bird into my own
room, and to keep it quiet that it might not hurt itself, I tied it down to a frame that I
contrived, straightened its little leg, warmed the injured bone by sucking it, and strapped
it to little wooden splints.  And behold it really set: the bird got quite well and fluttered
about the workshops again as sound as before, and whenever it saw me it would perch upon my
shoulder and peck very gently at my hair with its sharp beak.

"From that moment I could have found it in me to break the legs of every hen in the yard, that
I might set them again; but I thought of something better.  I went to the barbers and told
them that if any one had a bird, a dog, or a cat, with a broken limb, he might bring it to
me, and that I was prepared to cure all these injuries gratis; they might tell all their customers.
The very next day I had a patient brought me: a black hound, with tan spots over his eyes,
whose leg had been smashed by a badly-aimed spear: I can see him now!  Others followed; feathered
or four-footed sufferers; and this was the beginning of my surgical career.  The invalid birds
on the trees I still owe to my old allies the barbers.  I only occasionally take beasts in
hand.  The lame children, whom you saw in the garden, come to me from poor parents who cannot
afford a surgeon's aid. The merry, curly-headed boy who brought you a rose just now is to go
home again in a few days.--But to return to the story of my youth.

"The more serious events which gave my life this particular bias occurred in my twentieth year,
when I had already left even the high school behind me; nor was I fully carried away by their
influence till after my uncle had procured me several opportunities of proving my proficiency
in my calling.  I may say without vanity that my speeches won approval; but I was revolted
by the pompous, flowery bombast, without which I should have been hissed down, and though my
parents rejoiced when I went home from Niku, Arsmoe, or some other little provincial town,
with laurel-wreaths and gold pieces, to myself I always seemed an impostor.  Still, for my
father's sake, I dared not give up my profession, although I hated more and more the task of
praising people to the skies whom I neither loved nor respected, and of shedding tears of pathos
while all the time I was minded to laugh.

"I had plenty of time to myself, and as I did not lack courage and held stoutly to our Greek
confession, I was always to be found where there was any stir or contention between the various
sects.  They generally passed off with nothing worse than bruises and scratches, but now and
then swords were drawn.  On one occasion thousands came forth to meet thousands, and the Prefect
called out the troops--all Greeks--to restore order by force.  A massacre ensued in which thousands
were killed.  I could not describe it!  Such scenes were not rare, and the fury and greed of
the mob were often directed against the Jews by the machinations of the creatures of the archbishop
and the government.  The things I saw there were so horrible, so shocking, that the tongue
refuses to tell them; but one poor Jewess, whose husband the wretches--our fellow Christians--killed,
and then pillaged the house, I have never forgotten! A soldier dragged her down by her hair,
while a ruffian snatched the child from her breast and, holding it by its feet, dashed its
skull against the wall before her eyes--as you might slash a wet cloth against a pillar to
dry it--I shall never forget that handsome young mother and her child; they come before me
in my dreams at night even now.

"All these things I  saw; and I  shuddered to behold God's creatures, beings endowed with reason,
persecuting their fellows, plunging them into misery, tearing them limb from limb--and why?
Merciful Saviour, why? For sheer hatred--as sure as man is the standard for all things--merely
carried away by a hideous impulse to spite their neighbor for not thinking as they do--nay,
simply for not being themselves--to hurt him, insult him, work him woe.  And these fanatics,
these armies who raised the standard of ruthlessness, of extermination, of bloodthirstiness,
were Christians, were baptized in the name of Him who bids us forgive our enemies, who enlarged
the borders of love from the home and the city and the state to include all mankind; who raised
the adulteress from the dust, who took children into his arms, and would have more joy over
a sinner who repents than over ninety and nine just persons!--Blood, blood, was what they craved;
and did not the doctrine of Him whose followers they boastfully called themselves grow out
of the blood of Him who shed it for all men alike,--just as that lotos flower grows out of
the clear water in the marble tank?  And it was the highest guardians and keepers of this teaching
of mercy, who goaded on the fury of the mob: Patriarchs, bishops, priests and deacons--instead
of pointing to the picture of the Shepherd who tenderly carries the lost sheep and brings it
home to the fold.

"My own times seemed to me the worst that had ever been; aye, and--as surely as man is the
standard of all things--so they are! for love is turned to hatred, mercy to implacable hardheartedness.
The thrones not only of the temporal but of the spiritual rulers, are dripping with the blood
of their fellow-men.  Emperors and bishops set the example; subjects and churchmen follow it.
The great, the leading men of the struggle are copied by the small, by the peaceful candidates
for spiritual benefices.  All that I saw as a man, in the open streets, I had already seen
as a boy both in the low and high schools.  Every doctrine has its adherents; the man who casts
in his lot with Cneius is hated by Caius, who forthwith speaks and writes to no other end than
to vex and put down Cneius, and give him pain.  Each for his part strives his utmost to find
out faults in his neighbor and to put him in the pillory, particularly if his antagonist is
held the greater man, or is likely to overtop him.  Listen to the girls at the well, to the
women at the spindle; no one is sure of applause who cannot tell some evil of the other men
or women.  Who cares to listen to his neighbor's praises? The man who hears that his brother
is happy at once envies him!  Hatred, hatred everywhere!  Everywhere the will, the desire,
the passion for bringing grief and ruin on others rather than to help them, raise them and
heal them!

"That is the spirit of my time;  and everything within me revolted against it with sacred wrath.
I vowed in my heart that I would live and act differently; that my sole aim should be to succor
the unfortunate, to help the wretched, to open my arms to those who had fallen into unmerited
contumely, to set the crooked straight for my neighbor, to mend what was broken, to pour in
balm, to heal and to save!

"And, thank God! it has been vouchsafed to me in some degree to keep this vow; and though,
later, some whims and a passionate curiosity got mixed up with my zeal, still, never have I
lost sight of the great task of which I have spoken, since my father's death and since my uncle
also left me his large fortune.  Then I had done with the Rhetor's art, and travelled east
and west to seek the land where love unites men's hearts and where hatred is only a disease;
but as sure as man is the standard of all things, to this day all my endeavors to find it have
been in vain. Meanwhile I have kept my own house on such a footing that it has become a stronghold
of love; in its atmosphere hatred cannot grow, but is nipped in the germ.

"In spite of this I am no saint.  I have committed many a folly, many an injustice; and much
of my goods and gold, which I should perhaps have done better to save for my family, has slipped
through my fingers, though in the execution, no doubt, of what I deemed the highest duties.
Would you believe it, Paula?--Forgive an old man for such fatherly familiarity with the daughter
of Thomas;--hardly five years after my marriage with this good wife, not long after we had
lost our only son, I left her and our little daughter, Pul there, for more than two years,
to follow the Emperor Heraclius of my own free will to the war against the Persians who had
done me no harm--not, indeed, as a soldier, but as a surgeon eager for experience.  To confess
the truth I was quite as eager to see and treat fractures and wounds and injuries in great
numbers, as I was to exercise benevolence.  I came home with a broken hip-bone, tolerably patched
up, and again, a few years later, I could not keep still in one place.  The bird of passage
must need drag wife and child from the peace of hearth and homestead, and take them to where
he could go to the high school.  A husband, a father, and already grey-headed, I was a singular
exception among the youths who sat listening to the lectures and explanations of their teachers;
but as sure as man is the standard of all things, they none of them outdid me in diligence
and zeal, though many a one was greatly my superior in gifts and intellect, and among them
the foremost was our friend Philippus.  Thus it came about, noble Paula, that the old man and
the youth in his prime were fellow-students; but to this day the senior gladly bows down to
his young brother in learning and feeling.  To straighten, to comfort, and to heal: this is
the aim of his life too.  And even I, an old man, who started long before Philippus on the
same career, often long to call myself his disciple."

Here Rufinus paused and rose; Paula, too, got up, grasped his hand warmly, and said:

"If I were a man, I would join you!  But Philippus has told me that even a woman may be allowed
to work with the same purpose.--And now let me beg of you never to call me anything but Paula--you
will not refuse me this favor.  I never thought I could be so happy again as I am with you;
here my heart is free and whole.  Dame Joanna, do you be my mother!  I have lost the best of
fathers, and till I find him again, you, Rufinus, must fill his place!"

"Gladly, gladly!"  cried the old man; he clasped both her hands and went on vivaciously: "And
in return I ask you to be an elder sister to Pul. Make that timid little thing such a maiden
as you are yourself.--But look, children, look up quickly; it is beginning!--Typhon, in the
form of a boar, is swallowing the eye of Horns: so the heathen of old in this country used
to believe when the moon suffered an eclipse.  See how the shadow is covering the bright disk.
When the ancients saw this happening they used to make a noise, shaking the sistrum with its
metal rings, drumming and trumpeting, shouting and yelling, to scare off the evil one and drive
him away. Instruction in Chili is largely very under the control with the primary government, the minister
of justice and remote instruction being charged of the direction of all public schools from the university
down to the smallest and least public national school.  Wherever I have been in Christian lands, I have always
witnessed the same scenes: our holy faith has, to be sure, demolished the religions of the
heathen; but their superstitions have survived, and have forced their way through rifts and
chinks into our ceremonial.  They are marching round now, with the bishop at their head, and
you can hear the loud wailing of the women, and the cries of the men, drowning the chant of
the priests.  Only listen!  They are as passionate and agonized in their entreaty as though
old Typhon were even now about to swallow the moon, and the greatest catastrophe was hanging
over the world.  Aye, as surely as man is the standard of all things, those terrified beings
are diseased in mind; and how are we to forgive those who dare to scare Christians; yes, Christian
souls, with the traditions of heathen folly, and to blind their inward vision?"
