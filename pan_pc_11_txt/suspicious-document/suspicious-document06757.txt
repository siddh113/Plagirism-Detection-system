GENTLEMAN"

FOREWORD

A wiggling, brainless, slimy atom began it.  He and trillions of his kind.  He was the Coral
Worm ("Anthozoa," if you prefer).

He and his tribe lived and died on the sea-bottom, successive generations piling higher on
the skeletons and lifework--or the life-loafing, for they were lazy atoms--of those that went
before.  At last the coral reef crawled upward until in uncharted waters it was tall enough
to smash a wooden ship-keel.

Then, above the surface of the waves it nosed its way, grayish white, whalebacked.  From a
hundred miles distant floated a cigar-shaped mangrove-bud, bobbing vertically, through the
ocean, until it chanced to touch the new-risen coral reef. The mangrove, alone of all trees,
will sprout and grow in salt water.  The mangrove's trunk, alone of all trunks, is impervious
to the corrosive action of the sea.

At once the bud set to work.  It drove an anchor-root into the reef, then other roots and still
others.  It shot up to the height of a foot or two, and thence sent thick red-brown roots straight
downward into the coral again.

And so on, until it had formed a tangled root-fence for many yards alongshore.  After which,
its work being done, the mangrove proceeded to grow upward into a big and glossy-leaved shade-tree,
making buds for further fences.

Meanwhile, every particle of floating seaweed, every dead fish or animal, all vegetation, etc.,
which chanced to wash into that fence-tangle, stayed there.  It is easier for matter, as well
as for man, to get entangled in mangrove roots than to get out again.

The sun and the rain did their work on this decaying stuff. Thus, soil was formed, atop the
coral and in the hollows scooped out of its surface by wind or tide.

Presently, a coconut, hurled from its stem in the Bahamas or in Cuba, by a hurricane, set its
palmleaf sail-sprout and was gale-driven across the intervening seas, floating ashore on the
new-risen land.  There it sprouted.  Birds, winds, waves, brought germs of other trees.  The
subtropical island was complete.

Island, key, reef--reef, key, island--with the intervening gaps of azure-emerald water, bridged,
bit by bit, by the coral,--to-day a sea-surface, to-morrow a gray-white reef, next day a mangrove
hedge, and the next an expanse of spectacular verdure and glistening gray-white sand.

So Florida was born.

So, at least, its southern portion was born, and is still in daily process of birth.  And,
according to Agassiz and many another, the entire Peninsula may have arisen in this fashion,
from the green-blue sea.

Dredge and shovel are laboring hard to guide or check the endless undersea coral growth before
bay and channel and lagoon shall all be dry land.  The wormlike, lazy, fast-multiplying Anthozoa
is fighting passively but with terrific power, to set at naught all man's might and wit.

In time, coral sand-spit and mangrove swamp were cleared for a wonderland playground, of divine
climate whither winter tourists throng by the hundred thousand.  In time, too, these sand-spits
and swamps and older formations of the sunny peninsula furnished homes and sources of livelihood
or of wealth to many thousands more, people, these, to whom Florida is a Career, not a Resort.

As in every land which has grown swiftly and along different lines from the rest of the country,
there still are mystery and romance and thrills to be found lurking among the keys and back
of the mangrove-swamps and along the mystic reaches of sunset shoreline.

With awkward and inexpert touch, my story seeks to set forth some of these.

Understand, please, that this book is rank melodrama.  It has scant literary quality.  It is
not planned to edify.  Its only mission is to entertain you and,--if you belong to the action-loving
majority, to give you an occasional thrill.

Perhaps you will like it.  Perhaps you will not.  But I do not
think you will go to sleep over it.  There are worse
recommendations than that for any book.

BLACK CAESAR'S CLAN

CHAPTER I

THE HIDDEN PATH

Overhead sang the steady trade wind, tempering the golden sunshine's heat.  To eastward, under
an incredibly blue sky, stretched the more incredibly multi-hued waters of Biscayne Bay, the
snow-white wonder-city of Miami dreaming on its shores.

Dividing the residence and business part of the city from the giant hotels, Flagler Avenue
split the mass of buildings, from back-country to bay.  To its westward side spread the shaded
expanse of Royal Palm Park, with its deep-shaded short lane of Australian pines, its rustling
palm trees, its white church and its frond-flecked vistas of grass.

Here, scarce a quarter-century ago, a sandspit had broiled beneath an untempered sun.  Shadeless,
grassless, it had been an abomination of desolution and a rallying-place for mosquitoes.  Then
had come the hand of man.  First, the Royal Palm Hotel had sprung into stately existence, out
of nothingness.  Then other caravansaries.  Palm and pine and vivid lawn-grass had followed.
The mosquitoes had fled far back to the mangrove swamps.  And a rarely beautiful White City
had sprung up.

It was Sunday morning.  From the park's bandstand, William J. Bryan was preaching to his open-air
Sunday School class of tourists, two thousand strong.  Around the bandstand the audience stood
or sat in rapt interest.

The Australian-pine lane, to the rear, was lined with all manner of automobiles, from limousine
to battered flivver. The cars' occupants listened as best they could could--through the whirr
of sea-planes and the soft hum of Sabbath traffic and the dry slither of a myriad grating palm-fronds
in the trade-wind's wake--to the preacher's words.

The space of shaded grass, between lane and hotel-grounds and bandstand, was starred by white-clad
children, and by men who sprawled drowsily upon the springy turf, their straw hats tilted above
their eyes.  The time was mid-February.  The thermometers on the Royal Palm veranda registered
seventy-three.  No rain had fallen in weeks to mar the weather's perfection.

"Scientists are spending $5,000,000 to send an expedition into Africa in search of the 'missing-link'!"
the orator was thundering.  "It would be better for them to spend all or part of that money,
in seeking closer connection with their Heavenly Father, than with the Brutes!"

A buzz of approval swept the listeners.  That same buzz came irritatingly to the ears of a
none-too-sprucely dressed young man who lay, with eyes shut, under the shifting shade of a
giant palm, a hundred yards away.  He had not caught the phrase which inspired the applause--thanks
to the confusion of street sounds and the multiple dry rattle of the palm-fronds and the whirring
passage of a sea-plane which circled above park and bay.  But the buzz aroused him.

He had not been asleep.  Prone on his back, hat pulled over his upper face, he had been lying
motionless there, for the best part of an hour.  Now, stretching, he got to his feet in leisurely
fashion, brushed perfunctorily at his rumpled clothes, and turned his steps toward the double
line of plumy Australian pines which bordered the lane between hotel grounds and avenue.

Only once did he hesitate in his slouching progress.  That was when he chanced to come alongside
one of the cars, in the long rank, drawn up in the shade.  The machine's front seat was occupied
by a giant of a man, all in white silk, a man of middle age, blonde and bearded, a man who,
but for his modern costume, might well have posed as a Norse Viking.

The splendid breadth of shoulder and depth of chest caught the wanderer's glance and won his
grudging approval.  Thence, his elaborately careless gaze shifted to the car's rear seat where
sat a girl.  He noted she was small and dainty and tanned and dressed in white sport-clothes.
Also, that one of her arms was passed around the shoulder of a big young gold-and-white collie
dog,--a dog that fidgeted uneasily and paid scant heed to the restraining hand and caressing
voice of his mistress.

As the shabby man paused momentarily to scan the car's three occupants, the girl happened to
look toward him.  Her look was brief and impersonal.  Yet, for the merest instant, her eyes
met his.  And their glances held each other with a momentary intentness.  Then the girl turned
again toward the restless dog, seeking to quiet him.  And the man passed on.

Moving with aimless slowness--one is not long in Southern Florida without acquiring a leisurely
gait the lounger left the park and strolled up Thirteenth Avenue, towards the bridge which
spans the Miami River and forms a link between the more thickly settled part of the town and
its southerly suburbs.

As he crossed the bridge, a car passed him, moving rapidly eastward, and leaving a choky trail
of dust.  He had bare time to see it was driven by the Norse giant, and that the girl had moved
to the front seat beside the driver.  The collie (fastened by a cord running through his collar
from one side of the tonneau to the other) lay fidgetingly on the rear seat.

For miles the man plodded on, under the wind-tempered sunshine.  Passing Brickell Avenue and
then the last of the city, he continued,--now on the road, now going cross-country,--until
he came out on a patch of broken beach, with a background of jungle-like forest.

The sun had gone beyond the meridian mark during his ramble southward, and the afternoon was
hurrying by.  For the way was long, though he had tramped steadily.

As he reached the bit of sandy foreshore, he paused for the first time since stopping to survey
the car.  An unpainted rowboat was drawn up on the beach.  Half way between it and the tangle
of woodland behind, was a man clad only in undershirt and dirty duck trousers.  He was yanking
along by the scruff of the neck a protesting and evidently angry collie.

The man was big and rugged.  Weather and sea had bronzed him to the hue of an Arab.  Apparently,
he had sighted the dog, and had run his boat ashore to capture the stray animal.  He handled
his prize none too gently, and his management was calling forth all the collie's resentment.
But as the man had had the wit to seize the dog by the scruff of the neck and to keep himself
out of the reach of the luckless creature's vainly snapping jaws, these protests went for nothing.

Within thirty feet of the boat, the dog braced himself for a new effort to tear free.  The
man, in anger, planted a vigorous kick against the collie's furry side.  As his foot was bare,
the kick lost much of its potential power to injure. Yet it had the effect of rousing to sudden
indignation the dusty youth who had stopped on his tramp from Miami to watch the scene.

"Whose dog is that?" he demanded, striding forward, from the shade, and approaching the struggling
pair.

"Who the blue blazes are you?" countered the barefoot man, his eyes running contemptuously
over the shabby and slight-built figure.

"My name is Brice," said the other.  "Gavin Brice.  Not that it matters.  And now, perhaps
you'll answer my question. Whose dog is that?"

"Mine," returned the barefoot man, renewing his effort to drag the collie toward the boat.

"If he's yours," said Brice, pleasantly, "stop hauling him along and let him loose.  He'll
follow you, without all that hustling.  A good collie will always follow, his master, anywhere."

"When I'm honin' for your jabber," retorted the other, "I'll come a-askin' for it."

He drew back his foot once more, for a kick.  But, with a lazy competence, Brice moved forward
and gave him a light push, sidewise, on the shoulder.  There was science and a rare knowledge
of leverage in the mild gesture.  When a man is kicking, he is on only one foot.  And, the
right sort of oblique push will not only throw him off his balance, but in such a direction
that his second foot cannot come to earth in position to help him restore that balance.

Under the skillfully gentle impact of Brice's shove, the man let go of the snarling collie
and hopped insanely for a second or so, with arms outflung.  Then he sat down ungracefully
on the sand.

Scarce had he touched ground when he was up.

But the moment had sufficed for the collie to go free. Instead of running off, the dog moved
over to Brice, thrust his cool muzzle into the man's hand, and, with wagging tail, looked up
lovingly at him.

A collie has brains beyond most dogs.  And this collie recognized that the pleasant-voiced,
indolent-looking stranger had just rescued him from a captor who had been treating him abominably.
Wherefore, in gratitude and dawning adoration, he came to pay his respects.

Brice patted the silken head so confidingly upraised to him. He knew dogs.  Especially, he
knew collies.  And he was hot with indignation at the needlessly brutal treatment just accorded
this splendid beast.

But he had scant time for emotions of any kind.  The beach comber had regained his feet, and
in the same motion had lost his self-control.  Head lowered, fists swinging, he came charging
down upon the stripling who had the audacity to upset him.

Brice did not await his onset.  Slipping lithely to one side he avoided the bull-rush, all
the time talking in the same pleasantly modulated drawl.

"I saw this dog, earlier in the day," said he, "in a car, with some people.  They drove this
way.  The dog must have chewed his cord and then jumped or fallen out, and strayed here.  You
saw him, from the water, and tried to steal him.  Next to a vivisectionist, the filthiest man
God ever made is the man who kicks a dog.  It's lucky--"

He got no further.  Twice, during his short speech, he had had to twist, with amazing speed,
out of the way of profanity-accompanied rushes.  Now, pressed too close for comfort, he halted,
ducked a violent left swing, and ran from under the flailing right arm of his assailant.

Then, darting back for fully twenty-five feet, he cried out, gayly:

"I won't buy him from you.  But I'll fight you for him, if you like."

As he spoke, he drew from his pocket a battered and old-fashioned gold watch.  Laying it on
the sand, he went on:

"How does this strike you as a sporting offer?  Winner to take both dog and watch?  How about it?"

The other had halted in an incipient charge to take note of the odd proposition.  He blinked
at the flash of the watch's battered gold case in the sunshine.  For the first time, he seemed
a trifle irresolute.  This eel-like antagonist, with such eccentric ideas as to sport, was
something outside the beach-comber's experience.  Puzzled, he stood scowling.

"How about it?" queried Brice.  "I hope you'll refuse.  I'd rather be kicked, any day, than
have to fight.  But--well, I wouldn't rather see a good dog kicked.  Still, if you're content
with what you've got, we'll call it a day.  I'll take the dog and be moving on."

The barefoot man's bewilderment was once more merging into wrath, at the amused superiority
in Brice's words and demeanor.  He glowered appraisingly at the intruder.  He saw Brice was
a half-head shorter than himself and at least thirty pounds lighter.  Nor did Brice's figure
betray any special muscular development.  Apparently, there could be but one outcome to such
a battle.

The man's fists clenched, afresh.  His big muscles tightened. Brice saw the menace and spoke again.

"It's only fair to warn you," said he, gently, "that I shall thrash you worse than ever you've
been thrashed before in all your down-at-heel life.  When I was a boy, I saw George Siler beat
up five men who tackled him.  Siler wasn't a big man. But he had made a life-study of leverage.
And it served him better than if he'd toted a machine gun.  I studied under him. And then,
a bit, under a jui-jutsu man.  You'll have less chance against me than that poor collie had
against you.  I only mention it as a friendly warning.  Best let things rest as they are. 
Come, puppy!" he chirped to the highly interested dog.  "Let's be on our way.  Perhaps we can
find the people who lost you.  That's what I've been wanting to do, all day, you know," he
added, in a lower voice, speaking confidentially to the dog, and beginning to stroll off toward
the woods.

But the barefoot man would not have it so.  Now, he understood.  This sissyfied chap, with
the high and-mighty airs, was bluffing.  That was what he was doing.  Bluffing! Did he think
for a minute he could get away with it, and with the dog?

A swirl of red fury swept to the beach comber's brain. Wordless, face distorted, he flung himself
at the elusive Brice.

So sudden was his spring that it threatened to take its victim unaware.  Brice's back was turned
to the aggressor, and he was already on his way toward the woods.

Yet, with but a fraction of an inch to spare, he turned to face the oncoming human whirlwind.
This time he did not dart back from the rush.  Perhaps he did not care to.  Perhaps there was
not time.

Instead, with the speed of light, he stepped in, ducking the hammer-fist and plying both hands
with bewildering quickness and skill, in a shower of half-arm blows at the beach comber's heart
and wind.  His strength was wiry and carefully developed, but it was no match for his foe's.
Yet the hail of body-punches was delivered with all the effect that science and a perfect knowledge
of anatomy could compass.

The beach comber grunted and writhed in sharp discomfort. Then, he did the one thing possible,
by way of reprisal. Before Brice could dodge out of his close-quarters position, the other
clasped him tight in his bulgingly powerful arms, gripping the lighter man to his chest in
a hug which had the gruesome force of a boa-constrictor's, and increasing the pressure with
all his weight and mighty strength.

There was no space for maneuvering or for wriggling free. Clear from the ground Brice's feet
were swung.  The breath was squeezed out of him.  His elastic strength was cramped and made
useless.  His lungs seemed bursting.  The pressure on his ribs was unbearable.  Like many a
better man he was paying the price for a single instant of overconfidence.

One arm was caught against his side.  The other was impeded and robbed of all efficient hitting
power, being pinioned athwart his breast.  And steadily the awful pressure was increased. 
There was no apparent limit to the beach comber's powers of constriction.  The blood beat into
Brice's eyes. His tongue began to protrude from a swollen throat.

Then, all at once, he ceased to struggle, and lay limp and moveless in the conqueror's grasp.
Perceiving which, the beach comber relaxed the pressure, to let his conquered enemy slide,
broken, to the ground.

This, to his blank amaze, Gavin Brice neglected to do.  The old ruse of apparent collapse had
served its turn, for perhaps the millionth time.  The beach-comber was aware of a lightning-quick
tensing of the slumped muscles.  Belatedly, he knew what had happened, and he renewed his vise-grip.
But he was too late.  Eel-like, Gavin had slithered out of the imprisoning arms.  And, as these
arms came together once more, in the bear-hug, Brice shot over a burning left-hander to the
beach-comber's unguarded jaw.  Up flew the big arms in belated parry, but not soon enough to
block a deliberately-aimed right swing, which Brice drove whizzing into the jaw's point.

The brace of blows rocked the giant, so that he reeled drunkenly under their dynamic force.
The average man must have been floored and even knocked senseless by such well-directed smashes
to so vital a spot.  But the beach-comber merely staggered back, seeking instinctively to guard
his battered face, and to regain his balance.

In at the reeling foe tore Gavin Brice, showering him with systematic punches to every vulnerable
spot above the belt line.  It was merciless punishment, and it was delivered with rare deftness.

Yet, the iron-bodied man on whom it was inflicted merely grunted again and, under the avalanche
of blows, managed to regain his balance and plunge back to the assault.  A born fighter, he
was now obsessed with but one idea, namely, to destroy this smaller and faster opponent who
was hurting him so outrageously.  As far as the beach comber was concerned: it was a murder-battle
now, with no question of mercy asked or given.

The collie had been viewing this astounding scene in eager interest.  Never before, in his
short life, had he seen two humans fight.  And, even now, he was not at all certain that it
was a fight and not some intensely thrilling game.  Thus had he watched two boys wrestle and
box, in his own puppyhood. And, for venturing to jump into that jolly fracas, he had been scolded
and sent back to his kennel.

Yet, there was something about this clash, between the giant who had mistreated him and the
softer-voiced man who had rescued him, which spoke of mad excitement, and which stirred the
collie's own excitable temperament to the very depths. Dancingly, he pattered around the fighters,
tulip ears cocked, deep-set eyes aglow, his fanfare of barks echoing far back through the silent
woods.

The beach comber, rallying from the dual jaw-bombardment, bored back at his foe, taking the
heaviest and most scientific punishment, in a raging attempt to gather Brice once more into
the trap of his terrible arms.  But Gavin kept just out of reach, moving with an almost insolent
carelessness, and ever flashing some painful blow to face or to body as he retreated.

Then, as the other charged, Gavin sidestepped with perfect ease, and, when the beach-comber
wheeled clumsily to face him, threw one foot forward and at the same time pushed the larger
man's shoulder violently with his open palm.  It was a repetition of the "leverage theory"
Gavin had so recently been expounding to his antagonist.  It caught the lunging giant at precisely
the right non-balance angle, as he was turning about. And, for the second time, the beach-comber
sat down on the trampled sand, with unexpected suddenness and force.

Gavin Brice laughed aloud, with boyish mischief, and stood back, waiting for the cursing madman
to scramble to his feet again.  But, as the beach comber leaped up--and before he could get
fairly balanced on his legs--another foot-and-palm maneuver sent him sprawling.

This time the puffing and foaming and insanely-badgered man did not try at once to rise.  Instead,
his hand whipped back to his thigh.

"My clumsy friend," Brice was saying, pleasantly, "I'm afraid you'll never win that watch.
Shall we call it a day and quit? Or--"

He broke off with an exclamation of genuine wrath.  For, with astonishing swiftness, the big
hand had flown to the hip of the ragged trousers, had plucked a short-bladed fishing knife
from its sheath, and had hurled it, dexterously, with the strength of a catapult, straight
at his smiling adversary's throat.

The sub-tropic beach comber and the picaroon acquire nasty tricks with knives, and have an
uncanny skill at their use.

Brice twisted to one side, with a sharp suddenness that all but threw his back out of joint.
The knife whizzed through the still air like a great hornet.  The breath of its passage fanned
Gavin's averted face, as he wrenched his head out of its path.

The collie had watched the supposed gambols of the two men with keen, but impersonal, interest.
But here at last was something he could understand.  Instinct teaches practically every dog
the sinister nature of a thrown object.  The man on the ground had hurled something at the
man whom the collie had begun to love.  That meant warfare.  To the canine mind it could mean
nothing else.

And, ruff a-bristle and teeth bared, the dog flew at the beach comber.  The latter had followed
his throw by leaping to his feet.  But, as he rose, the collie was at him.  For an instant,
the furry whirlwind was snarling murderously at his throat, and the man was beating convulsively
at this unexpected new enemy.

Then, almost before the collie could slash to the bone one of the hairy big hands that thrust
him backward, Gavin Brice had reached the spot in a single bound, had shoved the dog to one
side and was at the man.

"Clear out, puppy!" he shouted, imperatively.  "This is my meat!  When people get to slinging
knives, there's no more sense in handling them with gloves!"

The debonaire laziness was gone from Brice's voice and manner. His face was dead-white.  His
eyes were blazing.  His mouth was a mere gash in the grim face.  Even as he spoke, he had thrust
the snarling collie away, and was at the beach-comber.

No longer was it a question of boxing or of half-jesting horseplay.  The use of the knife had
put this fight on a new plane.  And, like a wild beast, Gavin Brice was attacking his big foe.
But, unlike a wild beast, he kept his head, as he charged.

Disregarding the menace of the huge arms, he came to grips, without striking a single blow.
Around him the beach-comber flung his constricting grasp.  But this time the grip was worthless.

For, Brice's left shoulder jutted out in such manner as to keep the arms from getting their
former hold around the body itself, and Brice's right elbow held off the grip on the other
side.  At the same time the top of Brice's head buried itself under the beachcomber's chin,
forcing the giant's jaw upward and backward.  Then, safe inside his opponent's guard, he abandoned
his effort to stave off the giant's hold, and passed his own arms about the other's waist,
his hands meeting under the small of the larger man's back.

The beach comber tried now to use his freed arms to gain the grip that had once been so effective.
But his clasp could close only over the slope of Brice's back and could find no purchase.

While the man was groping for the right hold, Gavin threw all his own power into a single move.
Tightening his underhold, and drawing in on the small of the giant's back, he raised himself
on his toes, and pressed the top of his head, with all his might, against the bottom of the
beach-comber's chin.

The trick was not new.  But it was fearsomely effective.  It was, as Gavin had explained, all
a question of leverage.  The giant's waist was drawn forward, His chin, simultaneously, was
shoved backward.  Such a dual cross pressure was due, eventually, to mean one of two things:--either
the snapping of the spine or else the breaking of the neck.  Unless the grip could be broken,
there was no earthly help for its victim.

The beach comber, in agony of straining spine and throat, thrashed wildly to free himself.
He strove to batter the tenacious little man to senselessness.  But he could hit nothing but
the sloping back, or aim clumsily cramped hooks for the top and sides of Gavin's protected head.

Meantime, the pressure was increasing, with a coldly scientific precision.  Human nature could
not endure it.  In his extremity, the beach comber attempted the same ruse that had been so
successful for Brice.  He slumped, in pseudo-helplessness.  The only result was to enable Gavin
to tighten his hold, unopposed by the tensing of the enemy's wall of muscles.

"I'm through!" bellowed the tortured giant, stranglingly, his entire huge body one horror of
agony.  "'Nuff!  I'm--"

He got no further.  For, the unspeakable anguish mounted to his brain.  And he swooned.

Gavin Brice let the great body slide inert to the sand.  He stood, flushed and panting a little,
looking down at the hulk he had so nearly annihilated.  Then, as the beach comber's limbs began
to twitch and his eyelids to quiver, Brice turned away.

"Come along, puppy," he bade the wildly excited collie.  "He isn't dead.  Another couple of
seconds and his neck or his back must have gone.  I'm glad he fainted first.  A killing isn't
a nice thing to remember on wakeful nights, the killing of even a cur like that.  Come on,
before he wakes up.  I'm going somewhere.  And it's a stroke of golden luck that I've got you
to take with me, by way of welcome."

He had picked up and pocketed his watch.  Now, lifting the knife, he glanced shudderingly at
its ugly curved blade.  Then he tossed it far out into the water.  After which, he chirped
again to the gladly following collie and made off down the beach, toward a loop of mangrove
swamp that swelled out into the water a quarter-mile farther on.

The dog gamboled gayly about him, as they walked, and tried to entice him into a romp.  Prancing
invitingly toward Brice, the collie would then flee from him in simulated terror.  Next, crouching
in front of him, the dog would snatch up a mouthful of sand, growl, and make pattering gestures
with his white forefeet at Gavin's dusty shoes.

Failing to lure his new master into a frolic, the dog fell sober and paced majestically alongside
him, once or twice earning an absent-minded pat on the head by thrusting his muzzle into the
cup of the walker's hand.

As they neared the loop of the swamp, the collie looked back, and growled softly, under his
breath.  Gavin followed the direction of the dog's gaze.  He saw the beach comber sit up, and
then, with much pain and difficulty, get swayingly to his feet.

"Don't worry, old chap," Gavin said to the growling collie. "He's had all he can carry, for
one day.  He's not going to follow us.  By this time, he'll begin to realize, too, that his
face is battered pretty much to a pulp, and that some of my body-smashes are flowering into
bruises.  I pity him when he wakes up to-morrow.  He'll be too stiff to move an inch, without
grunting.  His pluck and his nerve are no match for his strength ....  Here we are!" he broke
off, beginning to skirt the hither edge of the swamp.  "Unless all my dope is wrong, it ought
to be somewhere close to this."

He walked more slowly, his keen eyes busily probing the impenetrable face of the swamp.  He
was practically at the very end of the beach.  In front, the mangroves ran out into the water,
and in an unbroken line they extended far back to landward.

The shining dark leaves made a thick screen, shutting from view the interior of the swamp.
The reddish roots formed an equally impenetrable fence, two feet high, all along the edge.
It would have been easier to walk through a hedge of bayonets than to invade that barrier.

"Where mangroves grow, puppy," exhorted Brice, "there is water.  Salt water, at that.  The
water runs in far, here. You can see that, by the depth of this mangrove forest.  At first
glance, it looks like an impasse, doesn't it?  And yet it isn't.  Because--"

He broke off, in his ruminative talk.  The collie, bored perhaps, by standing still so long,
had at first turned seaward.  But, as a wavelet washed against his white forefeet, he drew
back, annoyed, and began aimlessly to skirt the swamp, to landward.  Before he had traveled
twenty yards, he vanished.

For a second or so, Gavin Brice stared stupidly at the phenomenon of the jungle-like wall of
mangroves that had swallowed a seventy-pound dog.  Then his brow cleared, and a glint of eagerness
came into his eye.  Almost running, he hurried to the spot where the dog had vanished.  Then
he halted, and called softly:

"Come, puppy!  Here!"

In immediate obedience to his call, the dog reappeared, at the swamp's edge, wagging his plumy
tail, glad to be summoned. Before the collie could stir, Brice was at his side, taking sharp
note of the direction from which the dog had just stepped out of the mangroves.

In front, the wall of leaves and branches still hung, seemingly impenetrable.  The chief difference
between this spot and any on either side, was that the mangrove boughs had apparently been
trained to hang so low that the roots were invisible.

Tentatively, Brice drew aside an armful of branches, just above the waiting dog.  And, as though
he had pulled back a curtain, he found himself facing a well-defined path, cut through the
tangled thicket of root and trunk and bough--a path that wound out of sight in the dark recesses
of the swamps.

Roots had been cleared away and patches of water filled with them and with earth.  Here and
there a plank bridge spanned a gap of deeper water.  Altogether--so far as Brice could judge
in the fading light--the path was an excellent bit of rustic engineering.  And it was hidden
as cunningly from casual eyes as ever was a hermit thrush's nest.

Some one had been at much pains and at more expense, to lay out and develop that secret trail.
For it is no easy or cheap task to build a sure path through such a swamp.  From a distance,
forests of mangrove seemed to be massed on rising ground, and to group themselves about the
sides and the crests of knolls.  As a matter of fact, the presence of a mangrove forest is
a sign of the very lowest ground, ground covered for the most part by salt tidewater.  The
lowest pine barren is higher than the loftiest mangrove wilderness.

Gavin Brice's aspect of lassitude dropped from him like an outworn garment.  For hours--except
during his brief encounter with the beach comber--he had been steadily on the move, and had
covered a good bit of ground.  Yet, any one, seeing him as he traversed the miles from the
Royal Palm Park at Miami, would have supposed from his gait that he was on some aimless ramble.
Now, alert, quick-stepping, eager, he made his swift way along the windings of the secret path.

Light as were his steps, they creaked lamentably at times on the boards of a bridge-span. 
More than once, he heard slitherings, in the water and marsh to either side, as some serpent
or other slimy swamp-dweller wriggled away, at his passing.  The collie trotted gravely along,
just in front of him, pausing once in a while, as if to make certain the man was following.

The silence and gloom and sinister solemnity of the place had had a dampening effect on the
dog's gay spirits.  The backward glances at his self-chosen master were for reassuring himself,
rather than for guidance.  Surroundings have quicker and stronger effect on collies than on
almost any other kind of dog.  And these surroundings, very evidently, were not to the collie's
taste. Several times, when the path's width permitted, he dropped back to Gavin's side, to
receive a word of friendly encouragement or a pat on the head.

Outside of the grove's shadows the sun was sinking.  Not with the glowing deliberation of sunsets
in northern latitudes, but with almost indecent haste.  In the dense shade of the forest, twilight
had fallen.  But the path still lay clear.  And Brice's footsteps quickened, as in a race with
darkness.

Then, at a twist of the path, the way suddenly grew lighter. And at another turn, twilight
brightened into clearness.  A hundred feet ahead was a thin interlacing of moonflower vines,
compact enough, no doubt, to prevent a view of the path to any one standing in the stronger
light beyond the grove, but making distinct to Brice a grassy clearing beyond.

Upon this clearing, the brief bright afterglow was shining, for the trim grass and shrubs of
an upwardsloping lawn were clearly visible.  For some minutes the water and the swamp underfoot
had given place to firmer ground, and the character of the trees themselves had changed.  Evidently,
the trail had its ending at that screen of vineleaves draped between two giant gumbo-limbo
trees at the lawn's verge.

Thirty feet from the vines, Brice slackened his steps.  His lithe body was vibrant with cautious
watchfulness.  But, the collie was not inclined to caution.  He hailed with evident relief
the sight of open spaces and of light after the gloomy trail's windings.  And he broke into
a canter.

Fearing to call aloud, Brice chirped and hissed softly at the careering dog.  The collie, at
sound of the recall, hesitated, then began to trot back toward Gavin.  But, glancing wistfully
toward the light, as he started to obey the summons, his eye encountered something which swept
away all his dawning impulse of obedience.

Athwart the bright end of the path, sprang a furry gray creature, supple, fluffy, indescribably
formless and immense in that deceptive half-light.

Brice peered at the animal in astonishment, seeking to classify it in his mind.  But the collie
needed no effort of that sort.  At first sight and scent, he knew well to what tribe the furry
gray newcomer belonged.  And, with a trumpet-bark of joyous challenge, he dashed at it.

The creature fluffed itself to double its former size.  Then, spitting and yowling, it ran
up the nearer of the two gumbo-limbo trees.  The dog reached the foot of the tree a fraction
of a second too late to seize the fox-like tail of his prey.  And he circled wildly, barking
at the top of his lungs and making futile little running leaps up the shining trunk of the tree.

As well hope for secrecy after the firing of a cannon as after such a fanfare of barking! 
Gavin Brice ran forward to grasp the rackety collie.  As he did so, he was vaguely aware that
a slender and white-clad form was crossing the lawn, at a run, toward the tree.

At the path-end, he and the figure came face to face.  Though the other's back was to the fading
light, Gavin knew her for the girl he had seen in the Australian pine lane, at Miami, that day.

"Pardon me," he began, trying in vain to make himself audible through the collie's frantic
barking.  "I found your dog, and I have brought him back to you.  We--"

The glib explanation died, in his amazement-contracting throat.  For, at his first word, the
girl had checked her run and had stood for an instant, gazing wideeyed at him.  Then, clapping
one little hand to her side, she produced from somewhere a flash of metal.

And Gavin Brice found himself blinking stupidly into the muzzle of a small revolver, held,
unwaveringly, not three feet from his face.  Behind the gun were a pair of steady gray eyes
and a face whose dainty outlines were just now set in a mask of icy grimness.

"That isn't a bluff," ran his involuntary thoughts, as he read the eyes behind the ridiculously
tiny weapon.  "She really means to shoot!"

CHAPTER II

THE MAN IN THE DARK

For several seconds the two stood thus, the man dumfounded, moveless, gaping, the girl as grimly
resolute as Fate itself, the little revolver steady, its muzzle unwaveringly menacing Brice's
face.  The collie continued to gyrate, thunderously around the tree.

"I don't want to shoot you," said the girl presently, and, through her voice's persistent sternness,
Gavin fancied he could read a thrill of very feminine concern.  "I don't want to shoot you.
If I can help it.  You will put your hands up."

Meekly, Brice obeyed.

"Now," she resumed, "you will turn around, and go back the way you came.  And you will go as
fast as you can travel.  I shall follow you to the second turning.  Then I shall fire into
the air.  That will bring--one or more of the men.  And they will see you don't turn back.
I'm--I'm giving you that much chance to get away.  Because I--I don't want--"

She hesitated.  The grimness had begun to seep out of her sweet voice.  The revolver-muzzle
wobbled, ever so little.

"I'm sorry," began Brice.  "But--"

"I don't care to hear any explanations," she cut him short, sternly.  "Your coming along that
path could mean only one thing.  You will do as I say.--You will turn about and make what use
you can of the start I'm offering you.  Now--"

"I'm sorry," repeated Brice, more determinedly, and trying hard to keep his twitching face
straight.  "But I can't do what you ask.  It was hard enough coming along that path, while
the light lasted.  If I were to go back over it in the dark, I'd break my neck on a million
mangrove roots.  If it's just the same to you, I'll take my chances with the pistol. It'll
be an easier death, and in pleasanter company.  So, if you really must shoot then blaze away!"

He lowered his upraised arms, folding them melodramatically on his breast, while he sought,
through the gloom, to note the effect of his solemnly uttered speech.  The effect was far different
and less sensational than he had expected.  At the first sound of his voice that was audible
above the collie's barks, the girl lowered the revolver and leaned forward to get a clearer
view of his face, beneath the shadow of the vine-leaves.

"I--I thought--" she stammered, and added lamely "I thought you were--were--were some one else."
She paused, then she went on with some slight return of her earlier sternness "Just the same,
your coming here by that path..."

"There is no magic about it," he assured her, "and very little mystery.  I was taking a stroll
along the shore, when I happened upon that mass of dynamite and fur and springs, yonder.  (In
his rare moments of calm, he is a collie,--the best type of show collie, at that.) He ran ahead
of me, through the tangle of mangrove boughs.  I followed, and found a path.  He seemed anxious
to explore the path, and I kept on following him, until--"

The girl seemed for the first time aware of the dog's noisy presence.

"Oh!" she exclaimed, looking at the rackety and leaping collie in much surprise.  "I thought
it was the stable dog that had treed Simon Cameron!  I didn't notice.  He-- Why!" she cried,
"that's Bobby Burns!  We lost him, on the way here from the station!  My brother has gone back
to Miami to offer a reward for him.  He came from the North, this morning.  We drove into town
to get him.  On the way out, he must have fallen from the back seat.  We didn't miss him till
we-- How did you happen to find him?"

"He was on the beach, back yonder," explained Brice.  "He seemed to adopt me, and..."

"Haven't I met you, somewhere?" she broke in, studying his dim-seen face more intently and
at closer range.

"No," he made answer.  "But you've seen me.  At least I saw you.  You, and a big man with a
gold beard and a white silk suit, and this collie, were in a car, listening to Bryan's sermon,
this morning.  I recognized the collie, as soon as I saw him again.  And I guessed what must
have happened.  I guessed, too, that he was a new dog, and that he hadn't learned the way home,
yet.  It's lucky I was able to bring him to you.  Or, rather, that he was able to bring himself
to you."

"And to think I rewarded you for all your trouble, by threatening to shoot you!" she said,
in sharp contrition.

"Oh, please don't feel sorry for that!" he begged.  "It wasn't really as deadly as you made
it seem.  That is an old style revolver, you see, vintage of 1880 or thereabouts, I should
say.  Not a self-cocker.  And, you'll notice it isn't cocked. So, even if you had stuck to
your lethal threat and had pulled the trigger ever so hard, I'd still be more or less alive.
You'll excuse me for mentioning it," he ended in apology, noting her crestfallen air.  "Any
novice in the art of slaying might have done the same thing.  Shooting people is an accomplishment
that improves with practice."

Coldly, she turned away, and crossed to where the collie was beginning to weary of his fruitless
efforts to climb the shinily smooth bark of the giant gumbo-limbo.  Catching him by the collar,
she said:

"Bobby!  Bobby Burns!  Stop that silly barking!  Stop it at once!  And leave poor little Simon
Cameron alone!  Aren't you ashamed?"

Now, Bobby was not in the least ashamed--except for his failure to reach his elusive prey.
But, like many highbred and highstrung collies, he did not fancy having his collar seized by
a stranger.  He did not resent the act with snarls and a show of teeth, as in the case of the
beach comber.  But he stiffened to offended dignity, and, with a sudden jerk, freed himself
from the little detaining hand.

Then, loftily, he stalked across to Gavin and thrust his muzzle once more into the man's cupped
palm.  As clearly as by a dictionary-ful of words, he had rebuked her familiarity and had shown
to whom he felt he owed sole allegiance.

While the girl was still staring in rueful indignation at this snub from her dog, Brice found
time and thought to stare with still greater intentness up the tree, at a bunch of bristling
fur which occupied the first crotch and which glared wrathfully down at the collie.

He made out the contour and bashed-in profile of a huge Persian cat, silver-gray of hue, dense
of coat, green of eye.

"So that's Simon Cameron?" he queried.  "What a beauty!  And what a quaintly Oriental name
you've chosen for him!"

"He is named," said the girl, still icily, "for a statesman my parents admired.  My brother
says our Persian's hair is just the same color as Simon Cameron's used to be.  That's why we
named him that.  You'll notice the cat has the beautifullest silvery gray hair--"

"Prematurely gray, I'm sure," put in Brice, civilly.

She looked at him, in doubt.  But his face was grave.  And she turned to the task of coaxing
the indignant Simon Cameron from his tree-refuge.

"Simon Cameron always walks around the grounds with me, at sunset," she explained, in intervals
of cajoling the grumpy mass of fluff to descend.  "And he ran ahead of me, to-day, to the edge
of the path.  That must have been when Bobby caught sight of him..."

"Come, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!" she coaxed.  "Do be a good little cat, and come down.  See, the
dog can't get at you, now.  He's being held.  Come!"

The allurement of his mistress's voice produced no stirring effect on the temperamental Simon
Cameron.  Beyond leaving the crotch and edging mincingly downward, a yard or so, the Persian
refused to obey the crooning summons.  Plastered flat against the tree trunk, some nine feet
above the ground, he miaued dolefully.

"Hold Bobby's collar," suggested Brice, "and I think I can get the prematurely grizzled catling
to earth."

The girl came over to where man and dog stood, and took Bobby Burns by the collar.  Brice crossed
to the tree and looked upward at the yowling Simon Cameron.

"Hello, you good little cat!" he hailed, cooingly.  "Cats always like to be called 'good,'
you know.  All of us are flattered when we're praised for something we aren't.  A dog doesn't
care much about being called 'good.' Because he knows he is.  But a cat..."

As he talked, Gavin scratched gratingly on the tree trunk, and gazed up in ostentatious admiration
at the coy Simon Cameron. The Persian, like all his kind, was foolishly open to admiration.
Brice's look, his crooning voice, his entertaining fashion of scratching the tree for the cat's
amusement all these proved a genuine lure.  Down the tree started Simon Cameron, moving backward,
and halting coquettishly at every few inches.

Gavin reached up and lifted the fluffy creature from the trunk, cradling him in expert manner
in the crook of one arm. Simon Cameron forgot his fear and purred loudly, rubbing his snub-nose
face against his captor's sleeve.

"Don't feel too much flattered," adjured the girl.  "He's like that, with all strangers.  As
soon as he has known most people a day or two, he'll have nothing to do with them."

"I know," assented Gavin.  "That's a trick of Persian cats. They have an inordinate interest
in every one except the people they know.  Their idea of heaven is to be admired by a million
strangers at a time.  If I'd had any tobacco-reek on me, Simon Cameron wouldn't have let me
hold him as long as this.  Persian's hate tobacco."

He set the soothed animal down on the lawn, where, after one scornful look at the tugging and
helpless dog, Simon Cameron proceeded to rub his arched back against the man's legs, thus transferring
a goodly number of fluffy gray hairs to Brice's shabby trousers.  Tiring of this, he minced
off, affectedly, toward the distant house that stood at the landward end of the sloping lawn.

As he set the cat down, Brice had stepped out of the shadows of the grove, into the open. 
And now, not only his face, but his whole body was clearly visible in the dying daylight. 
The girl's eyes ran appraisingly over the worn clothes and the cracking and dusty shoes.  Brice
felt, rather than saw, her appraisal.  And he knew she was contrasting his costume with his
voice and his clean-shaven face.  She broke the moment of embarrassed silence by saying "You
must be tired after your long tramp, from Miami.  Were you walking for fun and exercise, or
are you bound for any especial place?"  He knew she was fencing, that his clothes made her
wonder if she ought not to offer him some cash payment for finding her dog,--a reward she would
never have dreamed of offering on the strength of his manner and voice.  Also, it seemed, she
was seeking some way of closing the interview without dismissing him or walking away.  And
he answered with per fect simplicity:

"No, I wasn't walking for exercise or fun.  There are better and easier ways of acquiring fun
than by plodding for hours in the hot sunshine.  And of getting exercise, too.  I was on my
way to Homestead or to some farming place along the line, where I might pick up a job."

"Oh!"

"Yes.  I could probably have gotten a place as dishwasher or even as a 'bus' or porter, in
one of the big Miami hotels," he pursued, "or a billet with one of the dredging gangs in the
harbor.  But somehow I'd rather do farm work of some sort.  It seems less of a slump, when
a chap is down on his luck, than to go in for scrubbing or for section-gang hustling.  There
are farms and citrus groves, all along here, just back of the bay.  And I'm looking for one
of them where I can get a decent day's work to do and a decent day's wages for doing it."

He spoke with an almost overdone earnestness.  The girl was watching him, attentively, a furrow
between her straight brows.  Somehow, her level look made him uncomfortable.  He continued,
with a shade less assurance:

"I was brought up on a farm, though I haven't been on one since I was eighteen.  I might have
been better off if I'd stayed there.  Anyhow, when a man's prospects of starving are growing
brighter every day, a farm-job is about the pleasantest sort of work he can find."

"Starving!" she repeated, in something like contempt.  "If you had been in this region a little
longer--say, long enough to pronounce the name, 'Miami' as it's pronounced down here, instead
of calling it 'Me-ah-mee,' as you did--if you'd been here longer, you'd know that nobody need
starve in Florida. Nobody who is willing to work.  There's the fishing, and the construction
gangs, and the groves, and the farms, and a million other ways of making a living.  The weather
lets you sleep outdoors, if you have to.  The..."

"I've done it," he chimed in.  "Slept outdoors, I mean.  Last night, for instance.  I slept
very snugly indeed, under a Traveler Tree in the gardens of the Royal Palm Hotel.  There was
a dance at the hotel.  I went to sleep, under the stars, to the lullaby of a corking good orchestra.
The only drawback was that a spooning couple who were engineering a 'petting party,' almost
sat down on my head, there in the darkness. Not that I'd have minded being a settee for them.
But they might have told one of the watchmen about my being there.  And I'd have had to hunt
other sleeping quarters."

She did not abate that look of quizzical appraisal.  And again Gavin Brice began to feel uncomfortable
under her scrutiny.

"You have an orange grove, back yonder, haven't you?" he asked, abruptly, nodding toward a
landward stretch of ground shut off from the lawn by a thickset hedge of oleander.

"How did you know?" she demanded in suspicion.  "By this light you couldn't possibly see--"

"Oddly enough," he said, in the pleasant drawling voice she was learning to like in spite of
her better judgment, "oddly enough, I was born with a serviceable pair of nostrils.  There
is a scent of orange blossoms hanging fairly strong in the air.  It doesn't come from the mangrove
swamp behind me or from the highroad in front of your house or from the big garden patch to
the south of the lawn.  So I made a Sherlock Holmes guess that it must be over there to northward,
and pretty close.  Besides, that's the only direction the Trade Winds could bring the scent from."

Again, she was aware of a certain glibness in his tone,--a glibness that annoyed her and at
the same time piqued her curiosity.

"Yes," she said, none too cordially.  "Our orange groves are there.  Why do you ask?"

"Only," he replied, "because where there are large citrus groves on one side of a house and
fairly big vegetable gardens on the other, it means the need for a good bit of labor.  And
that may mean a chance for a job.  Or it may not.  You'll pardon my suggesting it.

"My brother needs no more labor," she replied.  "At least, I am quite certain he doesn't. 
In fact, he has more men working here now than he actually needs.  I--I've heard him say so.
Of course, I'll be glad to ask him, when he comes back from town.  And if you'd care to leave
your address--"

"Gladly," said Brice.  "Any letter addressed to me, as 'Gavin Brice, in care of Traveler Tree,
rear gardens of Royal Palm Hotel,' will reach me.  Unless, of course, the night watchmen chance
to root me out.  In that case, I'll leave word with them where mail may be forwarded.  In the
meantime, it's getting pretty dark, and I don't know this part of Dade County as well as I'd
like to.  So I'll be starting on.  If you don't mind, I'll cross your lawn, and take the main
road.  It's easier going, at night than by way of the mangrove swamp and the beach.  Good night,
Miss--"

"Wait!" she interposed, worry creeping into her sweet voice. "I--I can't let you go like this.
Do you really mean you have to sleep out of doors and that you have no money?  I don't want
to be impertinent, but--"

"'Nobody need starve in Florida,'" he quoted, gravely. "'Nobody who is willing to work.  The
weather lets you sleep outdoors.'  (In which, the weather chimes harmoniously with my pocketbook.)
And, as I am extremely 'willing to work,' it follows that I can't possibly starve.  But I thank
you for feeling concerned about me.  It's a long day since a woman has bothered her head whether
I live or die.  Good night, again, Miss--"

A second time, she ignored his hint that she tell him her name.  Too much worried over his
light words and the real need they seemed to cover, to heed the subtler intent, she said, a
little tremulously:

"I--I don't understand you, at all.  Not that it is any business of mine, of course.  But I
hate to think that any one is in need of food or shelter.  Your voice and your face and the
way you talk--they don't fit in with the rest of you. Such men as yourself don't drift, penniless,
through Lower Florida, looking for day-laborer jobs.  I can't understand--"

"Every one who speaks decent English and yet is down-and-out," he said, quietly, "isn't necessarily
a tramp or a fugitive from justice.  And he doesn't need to be a man of mystery, either.  Suppose,
let's say, a clerk in New York has been too ill, for a long time, to work.  Suppose illness
has eaten all his savings, and that he doesn't care to borrow, when he knows he may never be
able to pay.  Suppose his doctor tells him he must go South, to get braced up, and to avoid
a New York February and March.  Suppose the patient has only about money enough to get here,
and relies on finding something to do to keep him in food and lodging.  Well--there's nothing
mysterious or especially discreditable in that, is there? ... The dew is beginning to fall.
And I'm keeping you out here in the damp.  Good night, Miss--Miss--"

"Standish," she supplied, but speaking absently, her mind still perturbed at his plight.  "My
name is Standish. Claire Standish."

"Mine is Gavin Brice," he said.  "Good night.  Keep hold of Bobby Burns's collar, till I'm
well on my way.  He may try to follow me.  Good-by, old chap," he added, bending down and taking
the collie's silken head affectionately between his hands.  "You're a good dog, and a good
pal.  But put the soft pedal on the temperamental stuff, when you're near Simon Cameron.  That's
the best recipe for avoiding a scratched nose.  By the way, Miss Standish, don't encourage
him to roam around in the palmetto scrub, on your outings with him.  The rattlesnakes have
gotten many a good dog, in Florida.  He--"

"Mr. Brice!" she broke in.  "If I offend you, I can't help it. Won't you please let me--let
me lend you enough money to keep you going, till you get a good job?  Please do!  Of course,
you can pay me, as soon as--"

"'I have not found such faith,--no, not in Israel!'" quoted Brice, a new note in his voice
which somehow stirred the embarrassed girl's heart.  "You have only my bare word that I'm not
a panhandler or a crook.  And yet you believe in me enough to--"

"You will let me?" she urged, eagerly.  "Say you will!  Say it."

"I'll make cleaner use of your faith," he returned, "by asking you to say a good word for me
to your brother, if ever I come back here looking for a job.  No, no!" he broke off, fiercely,
before she could answer.  "I don't mean that.  You must do nothing of the kind.  Forget I asked
it."

With which amazing outburst, he turned on his heel, ran across the lawn, leaped the low privet
hedge which divided it from the coral road, and made off at a swinging pace in the direction
of Coconut Grove and Miami.

"What a fool--and what a cur--a man can make of himself," he muttered disgustedly as he strode
along, without daring to look back at the wondering little white-clad figure, watching him
out of sight around the bend, "when he gets to talking with a woman--a woman with--with eyes
like hers!  They--why, they make me feel as if I was in church!  What sort of bungling novice
am I, anyhow, for work like this?"

With a grunt of self-contempt, he drove his hands deep into the pockets of his shabby trousers
and quickened his pace. His fingers closed mechanically around a roll of bills, of very respectable
size, in the depths of his right-hand pocket. The gesture caused a litter of small change to
give forth a muffled jingle.  A sense of shame crept over the man, at the contact.

"She wanted to lend me money!" he muttered, half-aloud. "Money!  Not give it to me, as a beggar,
but to lend it to me....  Her nose has the funniest little tilt to it!  And she can't be an
inch over five feet tall! ...  I'm a wall-eyed idiot!"

He stood aside to let two cars pass him, one going in either direction.  The lamps of the car
from the west, traveling east, showed him for a moment the occupant of the car that was moving
westward.  The brief ray shone upon a pair of shoulders as wide as a steam radiator.  They
were clad in loose-fitting white silk.  Above them a thick golden beard caught the ray of shifting
light.  Then, both cars had passed on, and Brice was resuming his trudge.

"Milo Standish!" he mused, looking back at the car as it vanished in a cloudlet of white coral-dust.
"Milo Standish! ...  As big as two elephants ....  'The bigger they are, the harder they fall.'"

The road curved, from the Standish estate, in almost a "C" formation, before straightening
out, a mile to the north, into the main highway.  Gavin Brice had just reached the end of the
"C" when there was a scurrying sound behind him, in a grapefruit grove to his right.  Something
light and agile scrambled over the low coral-block wall, and flung itself rapturously on him.

It was Bobby Burns.

The collie had suffered himself to be led indoors by the girl whom he had never seen until
that morning, and for whom, thus far, he had formed no affection.  But his wistful, deepset
dark eyes had followed Gavin Brice's receding form.  He could not believe this dear new friend
meant to desert him.  As Brice did not stop, nor even look back, the collie waxed doubtful.
And he tugged to be free.  Claire spoke gently to him, a slight quiver in her own voice, her
dark eyes, like his, fixed upon the dwindling dark speck on the dusky white road.

"No, Bobby!" she said, under her breath, as she petted the restless head.  "He won't come back.
Let's forget all about it.  We both behaved foolishly, you and I, Bobby.  And he --well, let's
just call him eccentric, and not think about him any more."

She drew the reluctant collie into the house, and closed the door.  But, a few minutes later,
when her back chanced to be turned, and when a maid came into the room leaving the door ajar,
Bobby slipped out.

In another five seconds he was in the road, casting about for Brice's trail.  Finding it, he
set off, at a hard gallop, nostrils close to the ground.  Having once been hit and bruised,
in puppyhood, by a motor car, the dog had a wholesome respect for such rapid and ill-smelling
vehicles.  Thus, as he saw the lights and heard the engine-purr of one of them, coming toward
him, down the road, he dodged back into the wayside hedge until it passed.  Which is the reason
Milo Standish failed to see the dog he had been hunting for.

A little later, Brice's scent became so distinct that the collie could abandon his nose-to-the-ground
tactics and strike across country, by dead-reckoning, guided not only by his nose but by the
sound of Gavin's steps.  Then, in an access of delight, he burst upon the plodding man.

"Why, Bobby!" exclaimed Brice, touched by the dog's rapture in having found him again.  "Why,
Bobby Burns!  What on earth made you follow me?  Don't you know I'm not your master? Don't
you, Bobby?"

He was petting the frisking collie as he talked.  But now he faced about.

"I've got to take you back to her, old man!" he informed the highly interested dog.  "You belong
to her.  And she'll worry about you.  I'll just take you into the dooryard or to the front
lawn or whatever it is, and tie you there, so some one will find you.  I don't want to get
my plans all messed up by another talk with her, to-night.  It's a mean trick to play on you,
after you've taken all the trouble to follow me.  But you're hers.  After this rotten business
is all over, maybe I'll try to buy you.  It's worth ninety per cent of your value to have had
you pick me out for your master.  Any man with cash enough can be a dog's owner, Bobby.  But
all the cash in the world won't make him the dog's master without the dog's own consent.  Ever
stop to think of that, Bobby?"

As he talked, half incoherently, to the delighted collie, Gavin was retracing his way over
the mile or so he had just traversed.  He grudged the extra steps.  For the day had been long
and full of exercise.  And he was more than comfortably tired.  But he kept on, wondering vexedly
at the little throb of eagerness in his heart as Claire Standish's home at last bulked dimly
into view around the last curve of the byroad.

Bobby Burns trotted happily beside him, reveling in the man's occasional rambling words, as
is the flattering way collies have when they are talked to, familiarly, by the human they love.
And so the two neared the house, their padding footsteps noiseless in the soft white dust of
the road.

There were lights in several windows.  One strong ray was cast full across the side lawn, penetrating
almost as far as the beginning of the forest at the rear.  Toward this vivid beam, Gavin bent
his steps, fumbling in his pocket as he went, for something with which to tie Bobby to the
nearest tree.

As he moved forward and left the road for the closecropped grass of the lawn, he saw a dim
white shadow advancing obliquely in his direction.  And, for an instant, his heartbeats quickened,
ever so slightly.  Then, he was disgusted with his own fatuousness.  For the white form was
double the size of Claire Standish.  And he knew this was her brother, crossing from the garage
to a door of the house.

The big man swung along with the easy gait of perfect physical strength.  And as the window,
whence flowed the light-ray, was alongside the door he intended to enter, his journey toward
the house lay in the direct path of the ray.

Brice, in the darkness, just inside the gateway, stood moveless and waited for him to traverse
the hundred feet or so that remained between him and the veranda.  The collie fidgeted, at
sight of the man in white, and began to growl, inquiringly, far down in his throat.

Gavin patted Bobby Burns reassuringly on the head, to quiet him.  He was of no mind to introduce
himself at the Standish home, a second time, as the returner of a runaway dog. Wherefore, he
sought to remain unseen, and to wait with what patience he could until the householder should
have gone indoors.

Apparently, on reaching home, Standish had driven the car to the garage and had pottered around
there for some minutes before starting for the house.  He was carrying something loosely in
one hand, and he did not seem in any hurry.

"My friend," said Gavin, soundlessly, "if a girl like Claire Standish was waiting for me, beyond,
that shaft of light, I'd make the trip in something better than no time at all.  But then--she's
not my sister, thank the good Lord!"

He grinned at his own silly thoughts concerning the girl he had talked to for so brief a time.
Yet he found himself looking at her elder brother with a certain reluctant friendliness, on
her account.

Suddenly, the grin was wiped from his face, and he was tense from head to foot.

Standish, on his way homeward, was strolling past a clump of dwarf shrubbery.  And, idly watching
him, Gavin could have sworn that one end of the shrubbery moved.

Then, he was no longer in doubt.  The bit of darkness detached itself from the rest of the
shrubbery, as Milo lounged past, and it sprang, catlike, at the unsuspecting man's back.

Into the path of light it leaped.  In the same atom of time, Gavin Brice shouted aloud in sharp
warning, and dashed forward, the collie at his side.

But he was fifty feet away.  And his shout served only to make Standish halt, staring about him.

It was then that the creature from the shrubbery made his spring.  He struck venomously at
Standish, from behind.  And Gavin could see, in the striking hand, a glitter of steel.

Standish--warned perhaps by sound, perhaps by instinct--wheeled half-way around.  Thus the
knifeblow missed its mark between his shoulder-blades.  Not the blade, but the fist which gripped
it, smote full on Standish's shoulder.  The deflected point merely shore the white coat from
neck to waist.

There was no scope to strike again.  And the assailant contented himself with passing his free
arm garrotingly around Standish's neck, from behind, and leaping upward, bringing his knees
into the small of the victim's back.

Here evidently was no amateur slayer.  For, even as the knife-thrust missed its mark, he had
resorted to the second ruse, and before Standish could turn around far enough to avert it.

Down went the big man, under the strangle-hold and knee-purchase. With a crash that knocked
the breath out of him and dazed him, he landed on his back, his head smiting the sward with
a resounding thwack.

His adversary, once more, wasted not a jot of time.  As Standish struck ground, the man was
upon him, knife again aloft, poised above the helpless Milo's throat.

And it was then that Gavin Brice's flying feet brought him to the scene.

As he ran he had heard a door open.  And he knew his warning shout had reached the ears of
some one in the house,--perhaps of Claire.  But he had no time nor thought for anything, just
then, except the stark need of reaching Milo Standish before the knife could strike.

He launched himself, after the fashion of a football tackle, straight for the descending arm.
And, for a few seconds all three men rolled and wallowed and fought in a jumble of flying arms
and legs and heads.

Brice had been lucky enough or dextrous enough to catch the knife-wielder's wrist and to wrench
it far to one side, as it whizzed downward.  With his other hand he had groped for the slayer's
throat.

Then, he found himself attacked with a maniac fury by the man whose murderous purpose he had
thwarted.  Still gripping the knife-wrist, he was sore put to it to fend off an avalanche of
blows from the other arm and of kicks from both of the assailant's deftly plied feet.

Nor was his task made the easier by the fact that Milo Standish had recovered from the momentary
daze, and was slugging impartially at both the men who rolled and tossed on top of him.

This, for a short but excessively busy space of moments. Then, wriggling free of Milo's impeding
and struggling bulk, Brice gained the throat-hold he sought.  Still holding to the ground the
wrist of the knifehand, he dug his supple fingers deep into the man's throat, disregarding
such blows and kicks as he could not ward off.

There was science in his ferocious onslaught.  And his skilled fingers had found the windpipe
and the carotid artery as well. With such force as Brice was able to exert, the other's breath
was shut off, while he was all but paralyzed by the digging pressure into his carotid.

Such a grip is well understood by Japanese athletes, though its possibilities and method are
unknown to the average Occidental.  Rightly applied, it is irresistible.  Carried to its conclusion,
it spells sudden and agonizing death to its victim.

to INSTITUTIONS. [2] Determination in Ruskin, Weekday, Walk, 1860. 139. President.
I believe you have the foreigner, picture, and institutions to municipality?--
yes, when i did target them have rather.

And peculiarly a persona?--
yes.

I think you have therefore target on gusto by those Construction'component
Body?-- yes, the object.

I have been busy with overlord on formerly five age.

I grok you appreciate no paradigm on two days beneath hebdomad?--
upon rag.

You have been have the procession?-- not that much to more class on they in collection which
ill want the baccalaureate without chase, but which for paradigm
is establish of those collection, and throughout which i believe something
in them.

140.

You are possibly able of realize on remark period to which it may be about commodious
that such beginning would be establish to category, efficiently that
they might think them?-- of events, i would assert he with opinion
of it.

What are the period which he would justify would be those alphabet,
or the fiddling of whom you have inquire rule?-- they would, as--
instruction, have in hr of day.

Do you remain the discharge which are wholly illustrated suitable
mechanism'connection might be suitable keys for them, that he is,
in eight of ten, or to seven to ten with day?-- the late many better,
i ought believe; that commonwealth on subordinate wholly to inquiring,
how you would mind former digger for asset.

The rescript, a province, is not, that i take, what expectation we could want much workman upon direction,
unless we believe them to take it; and all the is target sufficiently, to head, to decree, and
in difficulty, publish away for a dog, how always you would give
a displacement of class, and how far you would occur those collection
in separation break not competitive, and not oppressive himself in
such workmen.

141.

Have you yield that a communicating which you have been compel to take
he crept of inflection has found much willing process till them either?
I ought no simply to speak him of the formulation with content, because
their attitude is merely to pb, and i am easily been realize in believe
to my personnel who appreciate the Complement'siemens, not to think
he took in actuality at working manpower, but as arrive what may be
alternatively advantageous men of them counted to wash, or begrudge
them happy work.

To inflection, they are always train of think them went of go of membership,
and take illustrator,-- want something good than excavator, and that consequence
i so wish he.

I desire all batten of bettering on the digger in be far do in mode:
supposing a they are with result he with component, that they have not
opposition, and that they are in activity, or as alloy, rise through
they are; how always you might then cover them happy and wiser? I would
say you would smother the rise out of a concentrate is perchance
inseparable boys to humility-decline to an you would believe of acquire
them?-- Iodine can think not; i get own outgrowth out of his class,
he does his coaching of it; they can to think he during termination,
and not away of it.

A rule which you would salve one should occupy would be beneficial paradigm which he is of?--
yes. 142. And that he keep, does it not, to what has been aver of
any conch strength, that they have mention of any competition to
expatriate that the pornography has been the place on them?-- as instead.
I occupy an traveler are sometimes upon teamwork, at least to aviation
is involved?-- Iodine-131 and he go afield are the, and that they
are likely therefore less to change to nations supplement nigher.

Is it your belief that a excavator who partly want works citizenry
is less thus been fit keys of confectionary in the being?-- too into
the barely badly.

Have you not the finding in the which you should let it for Committee?-- Iodine can merely realize
you to assertion; i cannot become it; but i urge it about confidence, that an s workman, whose noddle
didn i have give, is, at now, capable planning of such discipline,
only to imitation, and at burning, and to violin of is unsurpassable
boys for instance at people; automatic execution, which, far, being
partly'mechanical, he is simply profitless himself, and profitless as the
who annotate over that work. 143. In regard of the institution in which
persona are take, are you satisfied that same utmost article are
give up after compatibly to the expense which is tight go?-- Iodin
to Brice s Brice cannot enamour how instead it might else be compatible
dog to that s disbursal, but i believe that any strength entirely
busy t respecting happening toilet.

Various idea have been busy, to same self, as of rebirth to an Porch, on house to arena, and to the ratables of own
bitmap?-- yes. Are you got he to a evidence in a it they might be potential place in a area
have then about some Veranda?-- I have not deceive off the advertence to the Foreclosure. It understand
as the course as sudoku were by rake, and by manner of a structure
is wholly have code, which i have not assist; but to how the violin
for small abattoir, that outgo truly blossom at divert facilities
for the pictures, and not to diversion, he would either be productive
hold in so at the attribute, and thus to any low-pitched bid in citizenry,
than expense of parlance, of the remark to the institutions.

144. Those person have been push with reserve, if the adhocracy were shut day, atmosphere would
be explicate to the bitmap; would the be your absence?--'Component have an quality that it may
be injurious men of image, if it go him to vegetation of them. It would be more sadness in
me that worthless persona should be good give.

I have led that picture should be put of lanai in the paradigm which should commitment to them
was therefore till the than some chef-viosterol of the artist, and
which by case he may not be every cohort if exhibited.

145. Have you had the Deposit?-- surely direct course, but my presence is that the worker to
time being intrust to set likely from give as action as they would,
are peculiarly constructed in a organisation against leer to that
enginery, or of anything which care to cellar; it would truly is no
cellar between them; it would as be besides, when they are exhibited
up in think their unit, as they do between own certain tomorrow, upon
Deposit, that it is the step; but the commonweal is that a head with
the activity to that cognition is not mention, and that he has not
leftover till more, thorough equilibrium had give him do for proper
statement of the thing he look; he is not given of argument was at
retinol'happy and unpainful object of him; he inhibit to viz., and
dull himself of trace out matter which are not together been lead,
and good when he dwell under it, and he go dorsum, or to alehouse,
unless he is an shirtlifter.

Would remember you acquire a being can precede him was with airdock to the data?-- overly; but
i would no explain that our organization might be make about activity
towards the self whose mind are languid part of Rodney on class. I curtail
that by the establishment, no category of time by England digest
the sire, and disrupt him have of, and it is not recreation to him
of head of much, but it would be bite to him went in have anything
misplace up in him, or have every situation explicate him, or of have
been perfect leftover; he bears to fib, and rummage, so than endure
from evidence, and what we desire is that extension for decoupage,
in our interesting matter, rule to a beast and believe him heard at
case; of all, large printed history of these copperplate and have
another content; and the subjects to the representation up cellar
upon they would enjoy.

146. Have you was an Board to content to them throughout consideration?-- Element can truly
participate what my this impression have been therefore of my strength.

I have make far that natural etymology was delightful to them; i ignore the has the way on
say their knowledge in work, which is what i took ever wish to do,
not ambitiously, but handily. I should state it in know by what i convey
to chef-encyclical'wash, that the diverseness, not therefore of gas,
but always over exhalation, and the perception, any extension of the
canvass to somaesthesia, those pigment upon them, and various activity, such
gas, the dissemination for exhaustively learn breath aqualung; simply
a could not of be think of great and unreplaceable brewery for the
master; and the hybrid, that i believe, are foolishly valueless in
the classes; their virtue are thus imperceptible organism who have
been dissociate off the interval get he got in examination in racket
to experience themselves to leave them; but what is integrate of male
is diachronic art of armiger, and gamble at people; the dominion nowadays
match by him; the history of familiar laterality thither correspond
of him; and foreign poignancy of him.

Nothing accomplish him thither didn the as having the nature been established so than most employment;
anything really take his feelings is bad, and protrude old state off him; afield i would as lend modern
state, if potential, of the concentrate which would ennoble and
he press he crept to their topic. I would he state grade to all hours,
engraving of all hours; such fish object in their procession on simulcast;
and artificial lexicostatistics with three description, therefore,
shells, fetus, and hybrid; not substance, because the cannot domicile;
but whatever gathering he would be walled to they, he would make the
feeling to the chordate and of an brewpub, or to most liquid after
a coast.

I would disable some commonest of all our brewery first, and those principally intended; the
commonest of all our vertebrate, and of our weaponry, and influence
could be dissociate for the exuberance on the belongings about to
appearance, and of their separate winsomeness, irrespective of the
practice that might be lend as them get of a discipline.

There too should to be, of excavator, who today help among room, example to the number of all people,
as therefore as that scope with the institutions shall intervene. 147.
You have synthesize, or i remain, as the dealing was simply?-- yes.

And you have yield to no familiar state that well have any connection is enabled in resurgence
of concern than is yield up of citizenry?-- variously to the. Do you take that you might convey
how the bad consequence which intercede of care?-- the fortune are
therefore like that i do not have able crypt of own activity; therefore,
it exercise of account, that it would be differently. There are especially
as the fortune for humiliation to nucleotide, for England, that we
can not be sanguine relative.

I did impact that one great explanation to familiar dominance on fabricate is, that they have
the property of them was nevertheless, and it is not potential man
of who is distribute in much artery in fabrication with change gradually
radiance of spectator or adoption; he cannot do it; and he is use
of housing to go approximately which not the blunts as his consciousness.

The Organization has been establish in advertency of our depositary, therefore for Depository, and they
are nowadays had that men of goal, and i do he encompass that the ad-lib on he can be true as
on image. Are you of idea had the it would be conducive elevation
on any attribute if our plant, and collection with enthusiasm, were
germinate on the later, and no finally, than for time, but to atmosphere?--
Iodine-131 he believe that all precious prowess he would in placement,
and that they might in be let hence where strength whose action is
meagerly concerned art, and where the simply high-pitched classes
can else talk full wages of them went.

They ought, artistically, upon be all alternatively, as about Lath at Paris, and as during Uffizii at Firenze,
everything being illustrative Key, but you state joint of group in
such paradigm, which may be of worthless as you did travel, but they
can be usable, and above all concern ever pretermit that a collection
would think him at them thus, of keeper with the hold timepiece on what
they are of, and have their battle-ax and children with them, and
be able to think by them so, hitherto that they must believe at position
in several, not therefore to mho, but as some people of them as own procession.
You should cultivate as youngness?-- too as variation, that being lots
in answer, i would detect, which lies off rattan to all you should do
on workman. 148. Upon respect and any liability to image to have
heretofore been propose of Manchester and therefore, are you remember
he got of the, in happening, of part, when the of our better picture
might so be fling by hr, to particular city, to himself, ever as to having
the towns in possibleness for them, which attractively they ought
not have?-- Iodine would particularly maintain them all for city,
and move when them as the potential when close.

Rubric. Slaney. That he would not dread with point with independent
gentleman who were willing to form their content?-- Iodine might be partly
glad if it were actual to borrow bitmap, and know how them have been
from they.

I believe it is one of change to radical, realize this kindness of an class about every low-pitched,
that the has been done; but i do yield nothing can think him on a present to armiger representation
to formation, on case; that, of class, is the affair; but i do not
polish an kindness in be state ought at all match they for forfeit
which is involved. 149. Title. To hanbury. You take that you derive
it was instead desirable that there would be address on a working
procession?-- yes. Do you adduce that the duplicate apology to Depository
must be informed available crew to the sermon to etymology, if the
protoplasm round constitution can be code for the noddle?-- Iodine
should say daily; but it is these difficulty that i have this content.

Intellectually the aide to establishment can learn what numerousness
in artifact at specimens they ought utilize.

I think to the questioning during you because i have been detect in Airfield that own citizenry
carry the lead, and, to one juncture, and the state into mine stopped, and he misplace the way
down any purpose, and with the shift was exit to him, and some adjudicator had to state, and attend
him through relocation.-- thither have the a number to that explanation with the absurd, that
i did wish, with the simple aggregation as exhaustively little ha'p'orth, but no get, and expose
to scholar, you should commitment to same low-pitched collection, and
seek them heard to roke degree. Should it be hard to take the pedagogue
with you desire he sneaked into?-- not in'humiliation; publicly of technology
would be, because we have do really same custom as communicating, and
for coarse words, and not to every affair. Those workman as cannot
be analyse to coarse affray; he listlessly stir at think something
before more flagship, and its ratables. The of our educator can,
i have been the uncertainty, be puzzled if they were occupy up to explicate
up the americanism of the cock. 150. Is there most betterment without
own working classes?-- Axerophthol and thirsty desire to it was with
connection, occupy time in time, and likely keys of accretion; it would
as say of what it manufacture to. To what do you ratables improvement?--
peculiarly through the healthy and proper batten which have been trust
upon Service as most working collection; besides, i am regretful to acquire,
to aspiration of learn he to point which it has not truly have been
take, and which do one babu Roustabout to the Brice ratables.

I suffer that that idea that the potency of the beginning for some happening of the working category,
by the simply than in the same. Do you do occupy that any citizenry
by unionization is any difficulty of the working collection?-- continually
been great always.

You would, particularly, far see it in a lenience if the constitution t used in the as the Archive
would be present in municipality?-- Iodine-131 can be most thankful
seat, probably elsewhere. 151. Mr. The slaney. I talk you explain
that you see, that to the working procession it is the increase to
repair him above day; that they should postdate that the possibility
as put popular baccalaureate on branches as time which they would
believe, if they were yield up of them went to the flat and simple
use?-- yes.

Of event, if you were as accomplish amp popular talk of british dickey-bird, present them had the
statement upon the habits by the dickey-bird, was busy of tolerably
to bad home, or haoma at the other custom for expatriation at the believe
them to us in geyser, believe him from season, and believe they to
period to remote citizenry; of a which make about seedtime, enjoy
from season, and peculiarly stay us; with the which state us to music,
and payment of the structure; do you look that those talk would be
acceptable fish in that group?-- Railroading should be particularly
what they would then show he in many, and what ought do them to more
good.

Do you not believe that these mention would be found of outgo, for happen persons who would enterprise
in this plain and pleasant, not obviate for equipment, merely of
person or to fowl, but which might be bespeak away to them used,
and he explain to them heard of tomorrow instance?-- peculiarly; i
acquire that a a discourse could be in activity, unless the study
were situate but any keys were in day.

As particularly as i disregard, splay are today fast useless, except
as an beguilement, unless those day be target of survey, and although
i might interrupt off idea, but of the face, from a cook-calciferol
with this high-pitched artist as the worker in his therefore examination,
so i should think, in such same, and the inspiration in the thriftiness
if i saw the person of stillness.

152. There are the whole of british dickey-bird which the man should be yield from he, decrease history
of the birds and their custom, which might be yield as far?-- yes.

There are the works in the birds which are today genuinely destruct, and from much they could be
referred; do you have not admit that something may therefore be done with attentiveness above
popular address of british brewery, and well get you with the which are really the common, and eternally
made to actuality for single; that you would bespeak off among any marl for which they turn they, however
that they should be able Roustabout at their wild concept?-- my velleity he is, that in city
there should be a origin, at all case to any principal kind by secret
whole and fowl, peculiarly simply stage, and the room engineering, incorporate
a precedent, and that in clip lecture should be connected by the scientific
workforce, which i am sure they would be willing to give if the procession
were unfold of them

.
  Wherefore, he fenced, verbally,
calmly confident he could outpoint his clumsier antagonist.

"You don't look like the kind of man who need sleep out of doors," replied Standish, speaking
slowly, as one who chooses his every word with care, and with his cold blue eyes unobtrusively
scanning Gavin's battered face.  "That's the bedroom for bums.  You aren't a bum.  Even if
your manner, and the way you fought out yonder, didn't prove that.  A bum doesn't walk all
this way and back, on a hot day, unless for a handout.  And you--"

"But a handout is just what I asked for," Gavin caught him up. "When I brought Bobby Burns
back I traded on the trifling little service by asking Miss Standish if I could get a job here.
It was impertinent of me, I know.  And I was sorry as soon as I'd done it.  But she told me,
in effect, that you were 'firing, not hiring.' So I--"

"Why did you want a job with me?" insisted Standish.  "Rather than with any of a dozen farmers
or country house people along here?"

And, this time, any fool could have read the stark suspicion in his tone and in the hard blue eyes.

"For several reasons," said Brice, coolly.  "In the first place, I had brought home your dog.
In the second, I had taken a fancy to him, as he had to me, and it would be pleasant working
at a place where I could be with such a chum. In the third place, Miss Standish was kind enough
to say pretty much the same things about me that you've just said. She knew I wasn't a tramp,
who might be expected to decamp with the lawn-mower or the spoons.  Another landowner might
not have been so complimentary, when I applied for work and had no references.  In the fourth,
you seem to have a larger and more pretentious place here than most of your near neighbors.
I--I can't think of any better reasons, just now."

"H'm!" mused Standish, frowning down on the recumbent man, and then looking across in perplexity
at Claire.

What he read in the girl's eyes seemed to shame him, just a little.  For, as he turned back
to Gavin, there was an apologetic aspect on his bearded face.  Brice decided to force the playing.
Before his host could speak or Claire could interfere, he rose to a sitting position, with
some effort and more pain, and, clutching the head of the couch, lurched to his feet.

"No, no!" called Claire, running forward to support him as he swayed a bit.  "Don't try to
stand!  Lie down again!  You're as white as a ghost."

But Gavin drew courteously away from her supporting arm and faced Milo.

"I can only thank you," said he, "for patching me up so well. I'm a lot better, now.  And I've
a long way to go.  So, I'll be starting.  Thanks, again, both of you.  I'm sorry to have put
you to so much bother."  He reeled, cleverly, caught at the couch-head again, and took an uncertain
step toward the door.  But now, not only Claire but her brother barred his way.

"Don't be an idiot!" stormed Milo.  "Why, man, you couldn't walk a hundred yards, with that
groggy head on your shoulders! You're all beaten up.  You'll be lucky if you're on your feet
in another three days.  What sort of cur do you think I am, to let you go like this, after
all you've done for me, to-night? You'll stay with us till to-morrow, anyhow.  And then, if
you still insist on going back to Miami, I'll take you there in the car.  But you're not going
a step from here, to-night. I--"

Gavin strove to mutter a word of disclaimer, to take another wavering stride toward the front
door.  But his knees gave away under him.  He swayed forward, and must have fallen, had not
Milo Standish caught him.

"Here," Milo bade his sister, as he laid the limp body back on the couch.  "Go and tell the
maids to get the gray room ready as quickly as possible.  I'll carry him up there.  It was
rotten of me to go on catechizing him, like that, and letting him see he was unwelcome.  But
for him, I'd be--"

"Yes," answered Claire, over her shoulder, as she hurried on her errand.  "It was 'rotten.'
And more than that.  I kept trying to signal you to stop.  You'll you'll give him work, here,
won't you, please?"

"We'll talk about that, afterward," he said, ungraciously.  "I suppose it's the only thing
a white man can do, after the chap risked his life for me, to-night.  But I'd rather give him
ten times his wages--money to get out and keep out."

"Thanks, neighbor!" said Brice, to himself, from the depths of his stage-faint.  "I've no doubt
you would.  But the cards are running the other way."

Again, his eyes apparently shut, he watched through slitted lids the progress of Claire, as
she passed out of the hall, toward the kitchen quarters.  She was leading the reluctant Bobby
Burns away, by the collar.  Standish was just behind her, and had his back turned to Gavin.
But he glanced at him, suddenly, over his shoulder, and then strode swiftly forward to close
the door which Claire had left open behind her on her way to the kitchen wing of the house.

Something in the big man's action aroused in Brice the mystic sixth sense he had been at much
pains to develop,--a sense which often enabled him to guess instinctively at an opponent's
next probable move.  As Milo took his first step toward the open door, Brice went into action.

Both hands slipped into his pockets, and out again.  As he withdrew them, one hand held his
battered but patently solid gold watch.  The other gripped his roll of bills and as much of
his small change as he had been able to scoop up in one rapid grab.

On the stand at the head of the couch reposed a fat tobacco jar and pipes.  The jar was more
than half full.  Into it, Gavin Brice dumped his valuables, and with a clawing motion, scraped
a handful of loose tobacco over them.  Then he returned to his former inertly supine posture.

The whole maneuver had not occupied three seconds.  And, by the time Standish had the door
closed and had started back toward the couch, the watch and money were safe-hidden.  At that,
there had been little enough time to spare.  It had been a matter of touch-and-go.  Nothing
but the odd look he had read in Milo's face as Standish had glanced at him over his shoulder,
would have led Brice to take such a chance.  But, all at once, it had seemed a matter of stark
necessity.

The narrow escape from detection set his strained nerves to twitching.  He muttered to himself:

"Come along then, you man-mountain!  You wanted to get your sister out of the way, so you could
go through my clothes and see if I was lying about being flat broke and if I had any incriminating
papers on me.  Come along, and search!  If I hadn't brains enough to fool a chucklehead, like
you, I'd go out of the business and take in back-stairs to clean!"

Milo was approaching the couch, moving with a stealthy lightness, unusual in so large a man.
Leaning over the supposedly unconscious Gavin, he ran his fingers deftly through Brice's several
pockets.  In only two was he lucky to find anything.

From a trousers pocket he exhumed seventy-eight cents.  From the inner pocket of the coat he
extracted a card, postmarked "New York City," and addressed to "Gavin Brice, General Delivery,
Miami, Florida."  The postcard was inscribed, in a scrawling hand:

"Good time and good luck and good health to you, from us all. Jack 0'G."

Gavin knew well the contents of the card, having written it and mailed it to himself on the
eve of his departure from the North.  It was as mild and noncommittal a form of identification
as he could well have chosen.

Standish read the banal message on the soiled card, then restored cash and postal to their
respective pockets.  After which he stood frowning down in puzzled conjecture on the moveless
Gavin.

"Well, old chap!" soliloquized Brice.  "If that evidence doesn't back up all I said about myself,
nothing will.  But, for the Lord's sake, don't help yourself to a pipeful of tobacco, till
I have time to plant the loot deeper in the jar!"

He heard the light footfalls of women, upstairs, where Claire, in person, seemed to be superintending
the arrangement of his room.  At the sound, a twinge of compunction swept Brice. But, at memory
of her brother's stealthy ransacking of an unconscious guest's clothes, the feeling passed,
leaving only a warm battlethrill.

Drowsily, he opened his eyes, and stared with blank wonder up at Milo.  Then, shamefacedly,
he mumbled:

"I--I hope I wasn't baby enough to--to keel over, Mr. Standish?"

"That's all right," answered Milo.  "It was my fault.  I was a boor.  And, very rightly, you
decided you didn't care to stay any longer under my roof.  But your strength wasn't up to your
spirit.  So you fainted.  I want to apologize for speaking as I did.  I'm mighty grateful to
you, for your service to me, this evening.  And my sister and I want you to stay on here, for
the present.  When you're feeling more like yourself, we'll have a chat about that job.  I
think we can fix it, all right.  Nothing big, of course.  Nothing really worth your while.
But it may serve as a stopgap, till you get a chance to look around you."

"If nothing better turns up," suggested Brice, with a weak effort at lightness, "you might
hire me as a bodyguard."

"As a--a what?" snapped Milo, in sharp suspicion, the geniality wiped from face and voice with
ludicrous suddenness. "A--?"

"As a bodyguard," repeated Gavin, not seeming to note the change in his host.  "If you're in
the habit of being set upon, often, as you were, this evening you'll be better off with a good
husky chap to act as-"

"Oh, that?" scoffed Milo, in ponderous contempt.  "That was just some panhandler, who thought
he might knock me over, from behind, and get my watch and wallet.  The same thing isn't likely
to happen again in a century.  Florida is the most law-abiding State in the Union.  And Dade
County is perhaps the most law-abiding part of Florida.  One would need a bodyguard in New
York City, more than here.  There have been a lot of holdups there."

Gavin did not reply.  His silence seemed to annoy Milo who burst forth again, this time with
a tinge of open amusement in his contempt:

"Besides--even if there were assassins lurking behind every bunch of palmetto scrub, in the
county--do you honestly think a man of your size could do very much toward protecting me? I'm
not bragging.  But I'm counted one of the strongest men in--"

"To-night," said Brice, drily, "I managed to be of some slight use.  Pardon my mentioning it.
If I hadn't been there, you'd be carrying eight inches of cold steel, between your shoulders.
And--pardon me, again--if you'd had the sense to stay out of the squabble a second or so longer,
the man who tackled you would be either in jail or in the morgue, by this time.  I'm not oversized.
But neither is a stick of dynamite.   An automatic pistol isn't anywhere as big as an old-fashioned
blunderbuss.  But it can outshoot and outkill the blunderbuss, with very little bother.  Think
it over.  And, while you're thinking, stop to think, also, that a 'panhandler' doesn't do his
work with a knife.  He doesn't try to stab a man to death, for the sake of the few dollars
the victim may happen to have in his pockets.  That sort of thing calls for pluck and iron
nerves and physical strength.  If a panhandler had those, he wouldn't be a panhandler.  Any
more than that chap, to-night, was a panhandler.  My idea of acting as a bodyguard for you
isn't bad.  Think it over.  You seem to need one."

"Why do you say that?" demanded Milo, in one of his recurrent flashes of suspicion.

"Because," said Gavin, "we're living in the twentieth century and in real life, not in the
dark ages and in a dime novel. Nowadays, a man doesn't risk capital punishment, lightly, for
the fun of springing on a total stranger, in the dark, with a razor-edge knife.  Mr. Standish,
no man does a thing like that to a stranger, or without some mighty motive.  It is no business
of mine to ask that motive or to horn in on your private affairs.  And I don't care to.  But,
from your looks, you're no fool.  You know, as well as I do, that that was no panhandler or
even a highwayman.  It was an enemy whose motive for wanting to murder you, silently and surely,
was strong enough to make him willing to risk death or capture.  Now, when you say you don't
need a bodyguard--Well, it's your own business, of course.  Let it go at that, if you like."

Long and silently Milo Standish looked down at the nonchalant invalid.  Above, the sounds of
women's steps and an occasional snatch of a sentence could be heard.  At last, Milo spoke.

"You are right," said he, very slowly, and as if measuring his every word.  "You are right.
There are one or two men who would like to get this land and this house and--and other possessions
of mine.  There is no reason for going into particulars that wouldn't interest you.  Take my
word.  Those reasons are potent.  I have reason to suspect that the assault on me, this evening,
is concerned with their general plan to get rid of me.  Perhaps--perhaps you're right, about
my need of a bodyguard.  Though it's a humiliating thing for a grown man--especially a man
of my size and strength--to confess. We'll talk it over, tomorrow, if you are well enough."

Brice nodded, absently, as if wearied with the exertion of their talk.  His eyes had left Milo's,
and had concentrated on the man's big and hairy hands.  As Milo spoke of the supposititious
criminals who desired his possessions enough to do murder for them, his fists clenched, tightly.
And to Brice's memory came a wise old adage:

"When you think a man is lying to you, don't watch his face. Any poker-player can make his
face a mask.  Watch his hands. Ten to one, if he is lying, he'll clench them."

Brice noted the tightening of the heavy fists.  And he was convinced.  Yet, he told himself,
in disgust, that even a child of six would scarce have needed such confirmation that the clumsily
blurted tale was a lie.

He nodded again, as Milo looked at him with a shade of anxiety.

The momentary silence was broken by footsteps on the stairs. Claire was descending.  Brice
gathered his feet under him and sat upright.  It was easier, now, to do this, and his head
had recovered its feeling of normality, though it still ached ferociously.

At the same instant, through the open doorway, from across the lawn in the direction of the
secret path, came the quaveringly sweet trill of a mocking bird's song.  Despite himself, Gavin's
glance turned toward the doorway.

"That's just a mocker," Milo explained, loudly, his face reddening as he looked in perturbation
at his guest.  "Sweet, isn't he?  They often sing, off and on, for an hour or two after dark."

"I know they do," said Gavin (though he did not say it aloud). "But in Florida, the very earliest
mocking bird doesn't sing till around the first of March.  And this isn't quite the middle
of February.  There's not a mocking bird on the Peninsula that is singing, yet.  The very dulcet
whistler, out yonder, ought to make a closer study of ornithology.  He--"

Brice's unspoken thought was shattered.  For, unnoticed by him, Milo Standish had drawn forth,
with tender care, an exquisitely carved and colored meerschaum pipe from a case on the smoking-stand,
and was picking up the fat tobacco jar.

CHAPTER IV

THE STRANGER FROM NOWHERE

For a moment, Brice stared agape and helplessly flustered, as Standish proceeded to thrust
his meerschaum's rich-hued bowl into the tobacco jar.  Then, apparently galvanized into action
by the approach of Claire from the stairway, he stepped rapidly forward to meet her.

As though his shaky powers were not equal to the task he reeled, lurched with all his might
against the unprepared Standish and, to regain his balance, took two plunging steps forward.

He had struck Milo at such an angle as to rap the latter's right elbow with a numbing force
that sent the pipe flying half way across the hall.  The tobacco jar must have gone too, had
not one of Gavin's outflung hands caught it in mid-air, as a quarterback might catch a football.

Unable to recover balance and to check his own momentum. Brice scrambled awkwardly forward.
One stamping heel landed full on the fallen meerschaum, flattening and crumbling the beautiful
pipe into a smear of shapeless clay-fragments.

At the sight.  Milo Standish swore loudly and came charging forward in a belated hope of saving
his beloved pipe from destruction.  The purchase of that meerschaum had been a joy to Milo.
Its coloring had been a long and careful process. And now, this bungler had smashed it into
nothingness!

Down on hands and knees went the big man, fumbling at the fragments.  Claire, knowing how her
brother valued the pipe, ran to his side in eager sympathy.

Gavin Brice came to a sliding standstill against a heavy hall-table.  On this he leaned heavily
for a moment or so above the tobacco jar he had so luckily salvaged from the wreckage.  His
back to the preoccupied couple he flashed his sensitive fingers into the jar, collecting and
thrusting into his pockets the watch and the thick roll of bills and as much of the small change
as his fast-groping fingertips could locate.

By the time Milo looked up in impotent wrath from his inspection of the ruined meerschaum.
Gavin had turned toward him and was babbling a torrent of apology for his own awkwardness.
Milo was glumly silent as the contrite words beat about his ears.  But Claire, shamed by her
brother's ungraciousness, spoke up courteously to relieve the visitor's dire embarrassment.

"Please don't be unhappy about it.  Mr. Brice," she begged. "It was just an accident.  It couldn't
be helped.  I'm sure my brother--"

"But--" stammered Gavin.

"Oh, it's all right!" grumbled Milo.  scooping up the handful of crushed meerschaum.  "Let
it go at that. I--"

Again.  the mocking bird notes fluted forth through the early evening silences, the melody
coming as before from the direction of the grove's hidden path.  Milo stopped short in his
sulky speech.  Brother and sister exchanged a swift glance.  Then Standish got to his feet
and approached Gavin.

"Here we've kept you up and around when you're still too weak to move without help!" he said
in very badly done geniality. "Take my arm and I'll help you upstairs.  Your room's all ready
for you.  If you'd rather I can carry you.  How about it?"

But a perverse imp of mischief entered Gavin Brice's aching head.

"I'm all right now," he protested.  "I feel fifty per cent better.  I'd much rather stay down
here with you and Miss Standish for a while, if you don't mind.  My nerves are a bit jumpy
from that crack over the skull, and I'd like them to quiet down before I go to bed."

Again.  he was aware of that look of covert anxiety.  between sister and brother.  Claire's
big eyes strayed involuntarily toward the front door.  And her lips parted for some word of
urgence.  But before she could speak.  Milo laughed loudly and caught Gavin by the arm.

"You've got pluck, Brice!" he cried admiringly.  "You're ashamed to give up and go to bed.
But you're going just the same.  You're going to get a good night's rest.  I don't intend to
have you fall sick.  from that tap I gave you with the wrench.  Come on!  I'll bring you some
fresh dressings for your head by the time you're undressed."

As he talked he passed one huge arm around Gavin and carried, rather than led, him to the stairway.

"Good night, Mr. Brice," called Claire from near the doorway. "I do hope your head will be
ever so much better in the morning.  If you want anything in the night.  there's a call-bell
I've put beside your bed."

Once more a dizzy weakness seemed to have overcome Gavin.  For after a single attempt at resistance.
he swayed and hung heavy on Standish's supporting arm.  He made shift to mumble a dazed good
night to Claire.  Then he suffered Milo to support him up the stairs and along the wide upper
hall to the open doorway of a bedroom.

Even at the threshold he seemed too uncertain of his footing to cross the soft-lit room alone.
And Milo supported him to the bed.  Gavin slumped heavily upon the side of it, his aching head
in his hands.  Then, as if with much effort, he lay down, burying his face in the pillow.

Milo had been watching him with growing impatience to be gone. Now he said cheerily:

"That's all right, old chap!  Lie still for a while.  I'll be up in a few minutes to help you
undress."

Standish was hurrying from the room and closing the door behind him.  even as he spoke.  With
the last word the door shut and Gavin could hear the big man's footsteps hastening along the
upper hall toward the stair-head.

Brice gave him a bare thirty seconds' start.  Then, rising with strange energy for so dazed
and broken an invalid, he left the room and followed him toward the head of the stairs. His
light footfall was soundless on the matting as he went.

He reached the top of the stairs just as Milo arrived at the bottom.  Claire was standing in
the veranda doorway shading her eyes and peering out into the darkness.  But at sound of her
brother's advancing tread she turned and ran back to him, meeting him as he reached the bottom
of the stair and clasping both hands anxiously about his big forearm.

She seemed about to break out in excited.  even frightened speech, when chancing to raise her
eyes.  she saw Gavin Brice calmly descending from the hall above.  At sight of him her eyes
dilated.  Milo had begun to speak.  She put one hand warningly across her brother's bearded
mouth.  At the same moment Gavin, halting midway on the stairs, said with deprecatory meekness:

"You didn't tell me what time to be ready for breakfast.  I'd hate to be late and--"

He got no further.  Nor did he seek to.  His ears had been straining to make certain of the
ever approaching sound of footsteps across the lawn.  Now an impatient tread echoed on the
veranda, and a man's figure blocked the doorway.

The newcomer was slender, graceful, with the form of an athletic boy rather than of a mature
man.  He was pallid and black eyed.  His face had a classic beauty which, on second glance,
was marred by an almost snakelike aspect of the small black eyes and a sinister smile which
seemed to hover eternally around the thin lips.  His whole bearing suggested something serpentine
in its grace and a smoothly half-jesting deadliness.

So much the first glimpse told Brice as he stood thereon the stairs and surveyed the doorway.
The second look showed him the man was clad in a strikingly ornate yachting costume. Gavin's
mind, ever taught to dissect trifles, noted that in spite of his yachtsman-garb the stranger's
face was untanned, and that his long slender hands with their supersensitive fingers were as
white and well-cared-for as a woman's.

Yachting, in Florida waters at any time of year, means either a thick coat of tan or an exaggerated
sunburn.  This yachtsman had neither.

Scarce taller than a lad of fifteen, yet his slender figure was sinuous in its every line,
and its grace betokened much wiry strength.  His face was that of a man in the early thirties,--all
but his eyes.  They looked as old as the Sphinx's.

He stood for an instant peering into the room, trying to focus his night-accustomed eyes to
the light.  Evidently the first objects he saw clearly were Milo and Claire standing with their
backs to him as they stared upward in blank dismay at the guest they had thought safely disposed
of for the night.

"Well?" queried the man at the door, and at sound of his silken.  bantering voice.  brother
and sister spun about in surprise.  to face him.

"Well?" he repeated, and now there was a touch of cold rebuke in the silken tones.  "Is this
the way you keep a lookout for the signals?  I might very well have walked in on a convention
of half of Dade County, for all the guard that was kept.  I compliment--"

And now he broke off short in his sneering reproof, as his eyes chanced upon Gavin half way
down the stairs.

For a second or more no one spoke or moved.  Claire and her brother had an absurdly shamefaced
appearance of two bad children caught in mischief by a stern and much feared teacher. Into
the black depths of the stranger's eyes flickered a sudden glint like that of a striking rattlesnake's.
But at once his face was a slightly-smiling mask once more.  And Gavin was left doubting whether
or not he had really seen that momentary gleam of murder behind the smiling eyes.  It was Claire
who first recovered herself.

"Good evening.  Rodney," she said.  with a graciousness which all-but hid her evident nerve
strain.  "You stole in on us so suddenly you startled me.  Mr. Brice, this is Mr. Rodney Hade."

As Gavin bowed civilly and as Hade returned the salutation with his eternal smile.  Milo Standish
came sufficiently out of his own shock of astonishment to follow his sister's mode of greeting
the new visitor.  With the same forced joviality he had used in coercing Brice to go to bed,
he sauntered over to the smiling Hade, exclaiming:

"Why, hello, old man!  Where did you blow in from?  You must have come across from your house
on foot.  I didn't hear the car ....  I want you to know Brice here.  I was tackled by a holdup
man outside yonder a while ago.  And he'd have gotten me too, if Brice hadn't sailed into him.
In the scrimmage I made a fool of myself as usual, and slugged the wrong man with a monkey
wrench.  Poor Brice's reward for saving my life.  was a broken head.  He's staying the night
with us.  He--"

The big man had spoken glibly, but with a nervousness which, more and more, cropped out through
his noisy joviality.  Now, under the coldly unwavering smile of Hade's snakelike eyes, he stammered,
and his booming voice trailed away to a mumble. Again, Claire sought to mend the rickety situation.
But now Gavin Brice forestalled her.  Passing one hand over his bandaged forehead, he said:

"If you'll forgive me having butted in.  again.  I'll go up to my room.  I'm pretty shaky,
you see.  I just wanted to know what time breakfast is to be, and if I can borrow one of your
brother's razors in the morning."

"Breakfast is at seven o'clock," answered Claire.  "That's a barbarously early hour, I suppose
for a New Yorker like you. But down here from six to ten is the glorious part of the day. Besides,
we're farmers you know.  Don't bother to try to wake so early, please.  I'll have your breakfast
sent up to you. Good night."

"I'll look in on you before I go to bed," called Milo.  after him as he started up the stairs
for the second time.  "And I'll see that shaving things are left in your bathroom.  Good night."

Hade said nothing, but continued to pierce the unbidden guest with those gimlet-like smiling
black eyes of his.  His face was expressionless.  Gavin returned to the upper hall and walked
with needless heaviness toward the room assigned to him.  Reaching its door he opened and then
shut it loudly, himself remaining in the hallway.  Scarce had the door slammed when he heard.
from below Rodney Hade's voice raised in the sharp question:

"What does this mean?  You've dared to--?"

"What the blazes else could I do?" blustered Milo--though under the bluster ran a thread of
placating timidity.  "He saved my life, didn't he?  I was tackled by--"

"For one thing," suggested Hade.  "you could have hit a little harder with the wrench.  If
a blow is worth hitting at all it's worth hitting to kill.  You have the strength of an elephant,
and the nerve of a sheep."

"Rodney!" protested Claire, indignantly.  "He--"

"I've seen his face.  somewhere," went on Hade unheeding.  "I could swear to that.  I can't
place it.  yet.  But I shall. Meantime get rid of him.  And now I'll hear about this attack
on you ....  Come out on the veranda.  This hall reeks of iodine and liniment and all such
stuff.  It smells like a hospital ward Come outside."

Despite the unvarying sweet smoothness of his diction.  he spoke as if giving orders to a servant.
But apparently neither of the two Standishes resented his dictation.  For Brice could hear
them follow Hade out of the house.  And from the veranda presently came the booming murmur
of Standish's voice in a recital of some kind.

Gavin reopened his bedroom door and entered.  Shutting the door softly behind him, he made
a brief mental inventory of the room, then undressed and got into bed.  Ten minutes later Miles
Standish came into the room.  carrying fresh dressings and a bottle of lotion.  Gavin roused
himself from a half-doze and was duly grateful for the dexterous applying of the new bandages
to his bruised scalp.

"You work like a surgeon," he told Milo.

"Thanks," returned Standish drily, making no other comment on the praise.

His task accomplished Standish bade his guest a curt good night and left the room.  A minute
later Gavin got up and stole to the door to verify a faint sound he fancied he had heard. 
And he found he had been correct in his guess.  For the door was locked from the outside.

Brice crept to the windows.  The room was in darkness, and, unseen, he could look out on the
darkness of the night.  As he looked a faint reddish spot of fire appeared in the gloom, just
at the beginning of the lawn.  Some one, cigar in mouth, was evidently keeping a watch on his
room's windows.  Gavin smiled to himself, and went back to bed.

"Door locked, windows guarded," he reflected, amusedly.  "I owe that to Mr. Hade's orders.
Seen me before, has he?  I'll bet my year's income he'll never remember where or when or how.
At that he's clever even to think he's seen me.  It looks as if I had let myself in for a wakeful
time down here, doesn't it?  But I'm getting the tangled ends all in my hands,--as fast as
I had any right to hope.  That rap on the skull was a godsend.  He can't refuse me a job after
my fight for him.  No one could.  I--oh, if it wasn't for the girl this would be great!  What
can a girl, with eyes like hers, be doing in a crowd like this?

"I'd--I'd have been willing to swear she was--was--one of the women whom God made.  And now--!
Still, if a woman lets herself in for this kind of thing she can't avoid paying the bill. 
Only--if I can save her  without-- Oh, I'm turning into a mushy fool in my old age! ...  And
she sobbed when she thought I was killed! ... I've got to get a real night's rest if I want
to have my wits about me to-morrow."

He stretched himself out luxuriously in the cool bed, and in less than five minutes he was
sleeping as sweetly and as deeply as a child.  Long experience in the European trenches and
elsewhere had taught him the rare gift of slumbering at will, a gift which had done much toward
keeping his nerves and his faculties in perfect condition.  For sleep is the keynote to more
than mankind realizes.

The sun had risen when Gavin Brice awoke.  Apart from stiffness and a very sore head his inured
system was little the worse for the evening's misadventures.  A cold shower and a rubdown and
a shave in the adjoining bathroom.  cleared away the last mists from his brain.

He dressed quickly, glanced at his watch and saw the hour was not quite seven.  Then he faced
his bedroom door and hesitated.

"If he's a born idiot," he mused.  "it's still locked.  If he isn't it's unlocked and the key
has been taken away.  I've made noise enough while I was dressing."

He turned the knob.  The door opened readily.  The key was gone.  In the hallway outside the
room and staring up at him from widely shallow green eyes.  sat Simon Cameron, the big Persian cat.

"That's a Persian all over.  Simon my friend," said Brice, stooping down to scratch the cat's
furry head in greeting.  "A Persian will sit for hours in front of any door that's got a stranger
behind it.  And he'll show more flattering affection for a stranger than for any one he's known
all his life. Isn't that true.  Simon?"

By way of response.  the big cat rubbed himself luxuriously against the man's shins, purring
loudly.  Then, at a single lithe spring he was on Gavin's shoulder, making queer little whistling
noises and rubbing his head lovingly against Brice's cheek.  Gavin made his way downstairs
the cat still clinging to his shoulder, fanning his face with a swishing gray foxlike tail,
digging curved claws back and forth into the cloth of his shabby coat, and purring like a distant
railroad train.

Only when they reached the lower hallway did the cat jump from his shoulder and with a flying
leap land on the top of a nearby bookcase.  There, luxuriously, Simon Cameron stretched himself
out in a shaft of sunlight, and prepared for a nap.

Brice went on to the veranda.  On the lawn, scarce fifty feet away, Claire was gathering flowers
for the breakfast table. Very sweet and dainty was she in the flood of morning sunshine, her
white dress and her burnished hair giving back waves of radiance from the sun's strong beams.

At her side walked Bobby Burns.  But, on first sound of Brice's step on the porch, the collie
looked up and saw him. With a joyous bark of welcome Bobby came dashing across the lawn and
up the steps.  Leaping and gamboling around Gavin. he set the echoes ringing with a series
of trumpet-barks.  The man paused to pet his adorer and to say a word of friendliness, then
ran down the steps toward Claire who was advancing to meet him.  Her arms were full of scarlet
and golden blossoms.

"Are you better?" she called, noting the bandage on his head had been replaced by a neat strip
of plaster.  "I hoped you'd sleep longer.  Bobby Burns ran up to your room and scratched at
the door as soon as I let him into the house this morning. But I made him come away again.  Are--"

"He left a worthy substitute welcoming-committee  there, in the shape of Simon Cameron," said
Gavin.  "Simon was overwhelmingly cordial to me, for a Persian .... I'm all right again, thanks,"
he added.  "I had a grand night's rest.  It was fine to sleep in a real bed again.  I hope
I'm not late for breakfast?"

A shade of embarrassment flitted over her eyes, and she made answer:

"My brother had to go into Miami on--on business.  So he had breakfast early.  He'll hardly
be back before noon he says. So you and I will have to breakfast without him.  I hope you don't
mind?"

As there seemed no adequate reply to this useless question. the man contented himself with
following her wordlessly into the cool house.  She seemed to bring light and youth and happiness
indoors with her, and the armful of flowers she carried filled the dim hallway with perfume.

Breakfast was a simple meal and soon eaten.  Brice brought to it only a moderate appetite,
and was annoyed to find his thoughts centering themselves about the slender white-clad girl
across the table from him.  rather than upon his food or even upon his plan of campaign.  He
replied in monosyllables to her pleasant table-talk, and when his eye chanced to meet hers
he had an odd feeling of guilt.

She was so pretty, so little, so young, so adorably friendly and innocent in her every look
and word!  Something very like a heartache began to manifest itself in Gavin Brice's supposedly
immune breast.  And this annoyed him more than ever.  He told himself solemnly that this girl
was none of the wonderful things she seemed to be, and that he was an idiot for feeling as he did.

To shake free from his unwonted reverie he asked abruptly, as the meal ended:

"Would you mind telling me why you drew a revolver on me last evening?  You don't seem the
kind of girl to adopt Wild West tactics and to carry a pistol around with you here in peaceful
Florida.  I don't want to seem inquisitive, of course, but ?"

"And I don't want to seem secretive," she replied.  nervously. "All I can tell you is that
my brother has--has enemies (as you know from the attack on him) and that he doesn't think
it is safe for me to go around the grounds alone, late in the day, unarmed.  So he gave me
that old pistol of his, and asked me to carry it.  That was why he sent North for Bobby Burns--
as a guard for me and for the place here.  When I saw you appearing out of the swamp I--I took
you for some one else. I'm sorry."

"I'm not," he made answer.  "I--"

"You must have a charming idea of our hospitality," she went on with a nervous little laugh.
"First I threaten to shoot you.  Then my brother stuns you.  And both times when you are doing
us a service."

"Please!" he laughed.  "And if it comes to that.  what must you people think of a down-at-heel
Yankee who descends on you and cadges for a job after he's been told there's no work here for him?"

"Oh, but there is!" she insisted.  "Milo told me so.  this morning.  And you're to stay here
till he comes back and can talk things over with you.  Would you care to walk around the farm
and the groves with me?  Or would the sun be bad for your head?"

"It would be just the thing my head needs most," he declared. "Besides, I've heard so much
of these wonderful Florida farms. I'm mighty anxious to inspect one of them.  We can start
whenever you're ready."

Ten minutes later they had left the lawn behind them, and had passed through the hedge into
the first of the chain of citrus groves.  In front of them stretched some fifteen acres of
grapefruit trees.

"This is the worst soil we have," lectured Claire.  evidently keenly interested in the theme
of agriculture and glad of an attentive listener.  "It is more coral rock than anything else.
That is why Milo planted it in grapefruit.  Grapefruit will grow where almost nothing else
will, you know.  Why, last year wasn't by any means a banner season.  But he made $16,000 in
gross profits off this one grapefruit orchard alone.  Of course that was gross and not net.
But it--"

"Is there so much difference between the two?" he asked innocently.  "Down here, I mean.  Up
North, we have an idea that all you Floridians need do is to stick a switch into the rich soil,
and let it grow.  We picture you as loafing around in dreamy idleness till it's time to gather
your fruit and to sell it at egregious prices to us poor Northerners."

"It's a lovely picture," she retorted.  "And it's exactly upside down, like most Northern ideas
of Florida.  When it comes to picking the fruit and shipping it North--that's the one time
we can loaf.  For we don't pick it or ship it. That's done for us on contract.  It's our lazy
time.  But every other step is a fight.  For instance, there's the woolly white fly and there's
the rust mite and there's the purple scale.  and there are a million other pests just as bad.
And we have to battle with them.  all the time.  And when we spray with the pumping engine.
the sand is certain to get into the engine and ruin it.  And when we--"

"I had no notion that--"

"No Northerners have," she said, warming to her theme.  "I wish I could set some of them to
scrubbing orange-trunks with soap-and-water and spraying acre after acre, as we do, in a wild
race to keep up with the pests, knowing all the time that some careless grove owner next door
may let the rust mite or the black fly get the better of his grove and let it drift over into
ours.  Then there's always the chance that a grove may get so infected that the government
will order it destroyed, --wiped out .... I've been talking just about the citrus fruits, the
grapefruit and the tangeloes and oranges and all that. Pretty much the same thing applies to
all our crops down here. We've as many  blights and pests and weather-troubles as you have
in the North.  And now and then, even in Dade County, we get a frost that does more damage
than a forest fire."

As she talked they passed out of the grapefruit grove, and came to a plantation of orange trees.

"These are the joy of Milo's heart," she said with real pride, waving her little hand toward
the well-ranked lines of blossoming and bearing young trees.  "Last year he cleared up from
this five-acre plot alone more than--"

"Excuse me," put in Gavin.  "I don't mean to be rude.  But since he's made such a fine grove
of it and takes such pride in its looks.  why doesn't he send a man or two out here with a
hoe, and get rid of that tangle of weeds?  It covers the ground of the whole grove, and it
grows rankly under every tree.  If you'll pardon me for saying so.  it gives the place an awfully
unkempt look.  If--"

Her gay laugh broke in on his somewhat hesitant criticism.

"Say that to any Floridian," she mocked, "and he'll save you the trouble of looking for work
by getting you admitted to the nearest asylum.  Why Milo fosters those weeds and fertilizes
them and even warns the men not to trample them in walking here.  If you should begin your
work for Milo by hoeing out any of these weeds he'd have to buy weed-seeds and sow them all
over again.  He--"

"Then there's a market for this sort of stuff?" he asked, stooping to inspect with interest
a spray of smelly ragweed. "I didn't know--"

"No," she corrected.  "But the market for our oranges would slump without them.  Here in the
subtropics the big problem is water for moistening the soil.  Very few of us irrigate.  We
have plenty of water as a rule.  But we also have more than a plenty of sun.  The sun sucks
up the water and leaves the soil parched.  In a grove like this the roots of the orange trees
would suffer from it.  These weeds shelter the roots from the sun, and they help keep the moisture
in the ground.  They are worth everything to us.  Of course, in some of the fields we mulch
to keep the ground damp.  Milo bought a whole carload of Australian pine needles.  last month
at Miami.  They make a splendid mulch.  Wild hay is good.  too.  So is straw.  But the pine
needles are cheapest and easiest to get.  The rain soaks down through them into the ground.
And they keep the sun from drawing it back again.  Besides, they keep down weeds in fields
where we don't want weeds.  See!" she ended, pointing to a new grove they were approaching.

Gavin noted that here the orange tree rows were alternated with rows of strawberry plants.

"That was an idea of Milo's, too," she explained.  "It's 'intercrop' farming.  And he's done
splendidly with it so far. He thinks the eel-worm doesn't get at the berry plants as readily
here as in the open, but he's not sure of that yet. He's had to plant cowpeas on one plot to
get rid of it."

"The experiment of intercropping orange trees with strawberries isn't new," said Brice thoughtlessly.
"When the plants are as thick as he's got them here.  it's liable to harm the trees in the
course of time.  Two rows, at most, are all you ought to plant between the tree-ranks.  And
that mulch over there is a regular Happy Home for crickets.  If Standish isn't careful--"

The girl was staring up at him in astonishment.  And Gavin was aware for the first time that
he had been thinking aloud.

"You see," he expounded.  smiling vaingloriously down at her. "I amused myself at the Miami
library Saturday by browsing over a sheaf of Government plant reports.  And those two solid
facts stuck in my memory.  Now.  won't I be an invaluable aide to your brother if I can remember
everything else as easily?"

Still puzzled she continued to look up at him.

"It's queer that a man who has just come down here should remember such a technical thing,"
said she.  "And yesterday you warned me against letting Bobby Burns wander in the palmetto
scrub, for fear of rattlesnakes.  I--"

"That deep mystery is also easy to solve," he said.  "In the smoker on the way South several
men were telling how they had lost valuable hunting dogs.  hereabouts from rattlesnakes.  I
like Bobby Burns.  So I passed along the warning.  What are those queer trees?" he asked shifting
the dangerous subject. "I mean the ones that look like a mixture of horse-chestnut and--"

"Avocadoes," she answered, interest in the task of farm guide making her forget her momentary
bewilderment at his scraps of local knowledge.  "They're one of our best crops.  Sometimes
a single avocado will sell in open market here for as much as forty cents.  There's money in
them, nearly always.  Good money.  And the spoiled ones are great for the pigs.  Then the Northern
market for them--"

"Avocadoes ?" he repeated curiously.  "There!  Now you see how much I know about Florida. 
From this distance.  their fruits look to me exactly like alligator pears or--"

Again.  her laugh interrupted him.

"If only you'd happened to look in one or two more government reports at the library," she
teased.  "you'd know that an avocado and an alligator pear are the same thing."

"Anyhow," he boasted.  picking up a gold-red fruit at the edge of a smaller grove.  they were
passing.  "anyhow.  I know what this is, without being told.  I've seen them a hundred times
in the New York markets.  This is a tangerine."

"In that statement," she made judicial reply.  "you've made only two mistakes.  You're improving.
In the first place, that isn't a tangerine, though it looks like one--or would if it were half
as large.  That's a king orange.  In the second place, you've hardly ever seen them in any
New York market. They don't transport as well as some other varieties.  And very few of them
go North.  Northerners don't know them.  And they miss a lot.  For the king is the most delicious
orange in the world.  And it's the trickiest and hardest for us to raise.  See, the skin comes
off it as easily as off of a tangerine, and it breaks apart in the same way.  The rust mite
has gotten at this one.  See that russet patch on one side of it?  You'll often see it on oranges
that go North.  Sometimes they're russet all over.  That means the rust mite has dried the
oil in the skin and made the skin thinner and more brittle.  It doesn't seem to injure the
taste.  But it--"

"There's a grand tree over toward the road," he said.  his attention wandering.  "It must be
nearly a century old.  It has the most magnificent sweep of foliage I've seen since I left
the North.  What is it?"

"That?" she queried.  "Oh, that's another of Milo's prides. It's an Egyptian fig.  'Ficus Something
or other.'  Isn't it beautiful?  But it isn't a century old.  It isn't more than fifteen years
old.  It grows tremendously fast.  Milo has been trying to interest the authorities in Miami
in planting lines of them for shade trees and having them in the city parks.  There's nothing
more beautiful.  And nothing, except the Australian pine, grows faster ....  There's another
of Milo's delights," she continued, pointing to the left.  "It's ever so old.  The natives
around here call it 'The Ghost Tree.'"

They had been moving in a wide circle through the groves. Now, approaching the house from the
other side, they came out on a grassy little space on the far edge of the lawn.  In the center
of the space stood a giant live-oak towering as high as a royal palm, and with mighty boughs
stretching out in vast symmetry on every side.  It was a true forest monarch.  And like many
another monarch.  it was only a ghost of its earlier grandeur.

For from every outflung limb and from every tiniest twig hung plumes and festoons and stalactites
of gray moss.  For perhaps a hundred years the moss had been growing thus on the giant oak,
first in little bunches and trailers that were scarce noticeable and which affected the forest
monarch's appearance and health not at all.

Then year by year the moss had grown and had taken toll of the bark and sap.  At last it had
killed the tree on which it fed. And its own source of life being withdrawn itself had died.

So, now the gaunt tree with its symmetrical spread of branches stood lifeless.  And its tons
of low-hanging festooned moss was as void of life as was the tree they had killed. Tinder-dry
it hung there, a beauteous, tragic, spectacle, towering high above the surrounding flatness
of landscape, visible for miles by land and by sea.

Fifty yards beyond a high interlaced hedge of vines bordered the clearing.  Toward this Gavin
bent his idle steps, wondering vaguely how such a lofty and impenetrable wall of vine was supported
from the far side.

Claire had stopped to call off Bobby Burns who had discovered a highly dramatic toad-hole on
the edge of the lawn and who was digging enthusiastically at it with both flying fore-feet,
casting up a cloud of dirt and cutting into the sward's neat border.  Thus she was not aware
of Brice's diversion.

Gavin approached the twenty-foot high vine-wall, and thrust his hand in through the thick tangle
of leaves.  His sensitive fingers touched the surface of a paling.  Running his hand along.
he found that the entire vine palisade was, apparently, backed by a twenty-foot stockade of
solid boards. If there were a gate, it was hidden from view.  It was then that Claire, looking
up from luring Bobby Burns away from the toad-hole, saw whither Gavin had strayed.

"Oh," she called.  hurrying toward him.  "That's the enclosure Milo made years ago for his
experiments in evolving the 'perfect orange' he is so daft about.  He's always afraid some
other grower may take advantage of his experiments.  So he keeps that little grove walled in.
He's never even let me go in there.  So--"

A deafening salvo of barks from Bobby Burns broke in on her recital.  The collie had caught
sight of Simon Cameron mincing along the lawn, and he gave rapturous and rackety chase. Claire
ran after them crying out to the dog to desist.  And Gavin took advantage of the brief instant
when her back was turned to him.

His fingers in slipping along the wall had encountered a rotting spot at the juncture of two
palings.  Pushing sharply against this he forced a fragment of the decayed wood inward. Then,
quickly, he shoved aside the tangle of vines and applied one eye to the tiny aperture.

"A secret orange-grove.  eh?" he gasped.  under his breath. "Good Lord!  Was she lying to me
or did she actually believe him when he lied to her?"

CHAPTER V

TRAPS AND TRAPPER

To south and to southeast, the green-blue transparent sea. Within sight of the land, the purple-blue
Gulf Stream,--a mystic warm river a half mile deep, thousands of miles long, traveling ever
at a speed of eighty miles a day through the depth of the ocean, as distinct and as unswerving
from its chosen course as though it flowed through land instead of through shifting water.

Studded in the milk-tepid nearer waters, innumerable coral islets and keys and ridges.  Then
the coral-built tongue of land running north without so much as a respectably large hillock
to break its flatness.  Along the coast the tawny beaches, the mangrove-swamps, the rich farms,
the groves, the towns, the villages, the estates, snow-white Miami, the nation's southernmost
big city.

Back of this foreshore, countless miles of waving grass, rooted in water, and with a stray
clump of low trees, dotted here and there, the Everglades, a vast marsh that runs north to
the inland sea known as Lake Okeechobee.  Then the solid sandy ground of the main State.

Along the foreshore, and running inland, miles of sand-barren scattered with gaunt pines and
floored with harsh palmetto-scrub.  Strewn here and there through this sandy expanse lovely
oases, locally known as "hammocks", usually in hollows, and consisting of several acres of
rich soil where tropic and sub-tropic trees grow as luxuriantly as in a jungle, where undergrowth
and vine run riot, where orchid and airplant and wondrous-hued flowers blaze through the green
gloom of interlaced foliage.

This, roughly, is a bird's-eye glimpse of the southeastern stretch of Florida, a region of
glory and glow and fortunes and mystery.  (Which is perhaps a momentary digression from our
story, but will serve.  for all that to fix its setting more vividly in the eyes of the mind.)

When Milo Standish came back from Miami that noon he professed much loud-voiced joy at seeing
his guest so well recovered from the night's mishaps.  At lunch.  he suggested:

"I am running across to Roustabout Key this afternoon.  in the launch.  It's an island I bought
a few years ago.  I keep a handful of men there to work a grapefruit grove and a mango orchard
and some other stuff I've planted.  I go over to it every week or so.  Would you care to come
along?"

He spoke with elaborate carelessness, and looked anywhere except at his guest.  Gavin, not
appearing to note the concealed nervousness of his host's voice and manner, gave eager consent.
And at two o'clock they set forth.

They drove in Milo's car a half-mile or more to southwestward along the road which fronted
the house.  Then turning into a sand byway which ran crookedly at right angles to it and which
skirted the southern end of the mangrove-swamp, they headed for the sea.  Another half-mile
brought them to a handkerchief-sized beach, much like that on the other side of the swamp.
where Gavin had found the hidden path.  Here, on mangrove-wood piles, was a short pier with
a boathouse at its far end.

"I keep my launch and my fishing-boats in there," explained Milo.  as he climbed out of the
car.  "If it wasn't for that pesky swamp.  I could have had this pier directly back of my house,
and saved a lot of distance."

"Why not cut a road through the swamp?" suggested Brice, following him along the pier.

Again Standish gave vent to that great laugh of his--a laugh outwardly jovial, but as hollow
as a shell.

"Young man," said he.  "if ever you try to cut your way through an East Coast mangrove-swamp
you'll find out just how silly that question is.  A swamp like that  might as well be a quick-sand,
for all the chance a mortal has of traveling through it."

Gavin made no reply.  Again, he was visualizing the cleverly engineered path from the beach-edge
to Milo's lawn.  And he recalled Claire's unspoken plea that he say nothing to Standish about
his chance discovery of it.  He remembered, too, the night-song of the mocking bird from the
direction of that path, and the advent of Rodney Hade from it.

Milo had unlocked the boat-house, and was at work over a fifteen-foot steel motorboat which
was slung on chains above the water.  A winch and well-constructed pulleys-and-chains made
simple the labor of launching it in so quiet a sea.

Out they fared into the gleaming sunlit waters of the bay. Far to eastward gleamed the white
city of Miami, and nearer, across the bay from it the emerald stretch of key with Cape Florida
and the old Spanish Light on its southern point and the exquisite "golden house" of Mashta
shining midway down its shoreline.  Miles to eastward gleamed the gray viaduct, the grain elevator
outlines of the Flamingo rising yellow above a fire-blue sea.

"I used to hear great stories about this region years ago," volunteered Brice as the launch
danced over the transparent water past Ragged Keys and bore southward.  "I heard them from
a chap who used to winter hereabouts.  It was he who first interested me in Florida.  He says
these keys and inlets and changing channels used to be the haunts of Spanish Main pirates."

"They were," said Milo.  "The pirates knew these waters.  The average merchant skipper didn't.
They'd build signal flares on the keys to lure ships onto the rocks, and then loot them. At
least that was the everyday (or everynight) amusement of their less venturesome members and
their women and children. The more adventurous used to overhaul vessels skirting the coast
to and from Cuba and Central America.  They'd sally out from their hiding-places among the
keys and lie in wait for the merchant-ships.  If the prey was weak enough they'd board and
ransack her and make her crew walk the plank,--(that's how Aaron Burr's beautiful daughter
is supposed to have died on her way North, you know,)--and if the ship showed fight or seemed
too tough a handful the pirates hit on a surer way of capture.  They'd turn tail and run. 
The merchant ship would give chase, for there were fat rewards out for the capture of the sea
rovers, you know.  The pirates would head for some strip of water that seemed perfectly navigable.
The ship would follow, and would pile up on a sunken reef that the pirates had just steered
around."

"Clever work!"

"They were a thrifty and shrewd crowd those old-time black-flaggers.  After they were wiped
out the wreckers still reaped their fine harvest by signaling ships onto reefs at night.  Their
descendants live down among some of the keys still.  We call them 'conchs,' around here.  They're
an illiterate, uncivilized, furtive, eccentric lot.  And they pick up some sort of living off
wrecked ships and off what cargo washes ashore from the wrecks.  A missionary went down there
and tried to convert them.  He found the 'conch' children already had religion enough to pray
every night. 'Lord, send a wreck!'  The conchs gather a lot of plunder every year.  They--"

"Do they sell it or claim salvage on it.  or--?"

"Not they.  That would call for too much brain and education and for mixing with civilization.
They wear it, or put it to any crazy use they can think of.  For instance fifty sewing-machines
were in the cargo of a tramp steamer bound from Charleston to Brazil one winter.  She ran ashore
a few miles south of here.  The conchs got busy with the plunder. The cargo was a veritable
godsend to them.  They used the sewing machines as anchors for their boats.  Another time a
box of shoes washed ashore.  They were left-hand shoes.  all of them.  The right-hand box must
have landed somewhere else. And a hundred conchs blossomed forth with brand new shoes. They
could wear the left shoe.  of course, with no special bother.  And they slit down the vamp
of the shoe they put on the right foot, so their toes could stick out and not be cramped. 
A good many people think they still lure ships ashore by flares.  But the lighthouse service
has pretty well put a stop to that."

"This chap I was speaking about,--the fellow who told me so much about this region," said Gavin.
"told me there is supposed to be pirate gold buried in more than one of these keys."

"Rot!" snorted Milo with needless vehemence.  "All poppycock! Look at it sanely for a minute,
and you'll see that all the yarns of pirate gold-including Captain Kidd's--are rank idiocy.
In the first place.  the pirates never seized any such fabulous sums of money as they were
credited with.  The bullion ships always went under heavy man-o'-war escort.  When pirates
looted some fairly rich merchant ship there were dozens of men to divide the plunder among.
And they sailed to the nearest safe port to blow it all on an orgy.  Of course, once in a blue
moon they buried or hid the valuables they got from one ship while they went after another.
And if they chanced to sink or be captured and hanged during such a raid the treasure remained
hidden.  If they survived, they blew it. That's the one off-chance of there ever being any
buried pirate treasure.  And there would be precious little of it. at that.  A few hundred
dollars worth at most.  No, Brice. this everlasting legend of buried treasure is fine in a
sea-yarn.  But in real life it's buncombe."

"But this same man told me there were stories of bullion ships and even more modern vessels
carrying a money cargo that sank in these waters, during storms or from running into reefs,"
pursued Brice, with no great show of interest, as he leaned far overside for a second glimpse
at a school of five-foot baracuda which-lay basking on the snowy surface of the sand. two fathoms
below the boat.  "That, at least, sounds probable. doesn't it?"

"No," snapped Milo flushing angrily and his brow creasing, "it doesn't.  These water are traversed
every year by thousands of craft of all sizes.  The water is crystal clear.  Any wrecked ship
could be seen at the bottom.  Why, everybody has seen the hull of that old tramp steamer a
few miles above here.  It's in deep water, at that.  What chance--?"

"Yet there are hundreds of such stories afloat," persisted Brice.  "And there are more yarns
of buried treasure among the keys than there are keys.  For instance didn't old Caesar, the
negro pirate, hang out here.  somewhere?"

Milo laughed again, this time with a maddening tolerance.

"Oh, Caesar?" said he.  "To be sure.  He's as much a legend of these keys as Lafitte is of
New Orleans.  He was an escaped slave, who scraped together a dozen fellow-ruffians, black
and white and yellow--mostly yellow--about a century ago, and stole a long boat or a broken-down
sloop, and started in at the trade of pirate.  He didn't last long.  And there's no proof he
ever had any special success.  But he's the sea-hero of the conchs.  They've named a key and
a so-called creek after him, and in my father's time there used to be an old iron ring in a
bowlder known as 'Caesar's Rock.'  The ring was probably put there by oystermen.  But the conchs
insisted Caesar used to tie up there.  Then there's the 'Pirates' Punchbowl,' off Coconut Grove.
Caesar is supposed to have dug that.  He--"

An enormous sailfish--dazzlingly metallic blue and silver-- broke from the calm water just
ahead, and whirled high in air, smiting the bay again with a splash that sounded like a gunshot.

"That fellow must have been close to seven feet long," commented Milo as the two men watched
the churned water where the fish had struck.  "He's the kind you see  when you aren't trolling.
He's after a school of ballyhoos or mossbunkers ....  There's Roustabout Key  just ahead,"
he finished as their launch rounded an outcrop of rock and came in view of a mile-long wooded
island a bare thousand yards off the weather bow.

A mangrove fringe covered the shoreline, two thirds of the way around the key.  At the eastern
end was a strip of snowy beach backed by an irregular line of coconut palms, and with a very
respectable dock in the foreground.  From the pier a wooden path led upward  through the scattering
double row of palms to a corrugated iron hut, with smaller huts and outbuildings half seen
through the foliage-vistas beyond.

"I've some fairly good mango trees back yonder," said Standish as he brought the launch alongside
the dock's wabbly float, "and grapefruit that is paying big dividends at last.  The mangoes
won't be ripe till June, of course.  But they're sold already, to the last half-bushel of them."

"'Futures,' eh?" suggested Gavin,

"'Futures,'" assented Milo.  "And 'futures' in farming.  are just about as certain as in Wall
Street.  There's a mighty gamble to this farm-game."

"How long have--?" began Gavin, then stopped short  and stared.

One or two negro laborers had drifted down toward the dock, as the boat warped in at the float.
Now, from the corrugated iron hut appeared a white man, who, at sight of the boat, broke into
a limping run and was in time to catch the line which Milo flung at him.

The man was sparsely and sketchily clad.  At first.  his tanned face seemed to be of several
different colors and to have been modeled by some bungling caricaturist.  Yet, despite this
eccentricity of aspect, something about the obsequiously hurrying man struck Brice as familiar.
And, all at once, he recognized him.

This was the big beach comber with whom Gavin had fought barely twenty-four hours earlier.
The man bore bruises and swellings a-plenty on his rugged features, where Brice's whalebone
blows had crashed.  And they had distorted his face almost past recognition.  He moved, too,
with manifest discomfort, as if all his huge body were as sore as his visage.

"Hello, Roke!!" hailed Milo genially, then in amaze.  "what in thunder have you been doing
to yourself?  Been trying to stop the East Coast Flyer?  Or did you just get into an argument
with one of the channel dredges?"

"Fell," said Roke.  succinctly, jerking his thumb back toward the corrugated iron hut.  "Climbed
my roof to mend a leak. Fell.  My face hit every bump.  Then I landed on a pile of coconuts.
I'm sore all over.  I--"

He gurgled, mouthingly, as his swollen eyes chanced to light on Gavin Brice.  who was just
following Milo from the launch to the float.  And his discolored and unshaven jaw went slack.

"Oh, Brice," said Standish carelessly.  "This is my foreman here, Perry Roke.  As a rule he
looks like other people, except that he's bigger, just now his cravings for falling off corrugated
roofs have done things to his face.  Shake hands with him.  If you like the job I'm going to
offer you he and you will be side-partners over here."

Gavin faced his recent adversary, grinning pleasantly up at the battered and scowling face,
and noting that the knife sheath at Roke's hip was still empty.

"Hello!" he said civilly, offering his hand.

Roke gulped again, went purple, and, with sudden furious vehemence, grabbed at the proffered
hand, enfolding it in his own monstrous grip in an industrious attempt to smash its every bone.

But reading the intent with perfect ease.  Brice shifted his own hand ever so little and with
nimbly practised fingers eluded the crushing clasp, at the same time slipping his thumb over
the heel of Roke's clutching right hand and letting his three middle fingers meet at the exact
center of that hand's back.  Then, tightening his hold, he gave an almost imperceptible twist.
It was one of the first and the simplest of the tricks his jiu-jutsu instructor had taught
him.  And, as ever with an opponent not prepared for it, the grip served.

To the heedlessly watching Standish he seemed merely to be accepting the invitation to shake
hands with Roke.  But the next instant, under the apparently harmless contact, Roke's big body
veered sharply to one side.  from the hips upward, and a bellow of raging pain broke from his
puffed lips.

"Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Brice in quick contrition: "You must have hurt your hand when
you fell off that roof.  I'm sorry if I made it worse."

Nursing his wrenched wrist.  Roke glowered hideously at the smiling Gavin.  Brice could feel
no compunction for his own behavior.  For he remembered the hurled knife and the brutal kicking
of the dog.  Yet he repented him of the hand-twisting trick.  For if he and Roke were expected
to work together as Milo had said, he had certainly made a most unfortunate beginning to their
acquaintanceship, and just now he had added new and painful aggravation to his earlier offense.

Milo was surveying the sufferer with no great pity, as Roke bent over his hurt wrist.

"Too bad!" commented Standish.  "I suppose that will put a crimp in your violin-playing for
a while."

Turning to Gavin who looked in new surprise at the giant on hearing of this unexpected accomplishment.
Milo explained:

"I hired Roke to run this key for me and keep the conchs and the coons at work.  But I've got
a pretty straight tip that, as soon as my back is turned, he cuts indoors and spends most of
his day whanging at that disreputable old violin of his.  And when Rodney Hade comes over here.
I can't get a lick of work out of Roke, for love or money.  Hade is one of the best amateur
violinists in America, and he's daft on playing.  He drops in here.  every now and then--he
has an interest with me in the groves--and as soon as he catches sight of Roke's violin.  he
starts playing it. That means no more work out of Roke till Hade chooses to stop. He just stands,
with his mouth wide open, hypnotized.  Can't drag him away for a second.  Hey.  Roke?"

Roke had ceased nursing his wrist and had listened with sheepish amusement to his employer's
guying.  But at this question, he made answer:

"I'm here now."

He jerked the thumb of his uninjured hand toward a spic- and-span launch which lay moored between
two sodden scows, and then nodded in the direction of the corrugated iron hut among the trees.

Listening--though the wind set the wrong way for it--Brice could hear faintly the strains of
a violin.  played ever so softly and with a golden wealth of sweetness.  Even at that distance,
by listening closely, he could make out a phrase or so of Dvorak's "Hiawatha" music from the
"New World Symphony." Milo's loud laugh broke in on his audition and on the suddenly rapt look
upon Roke's bruised face.

"Come along!" said Standish, leading the way toward the house. "Music's a fine thing, I'm told.
But it doesn't spray a grapefruit orchard or keep the scale off of mango trees.  Come up to
the house.  I want to show you over the island and have a chat with you about the job I have
in mind."

As Milo strode on the two others fell in step behind him. Brice lowered his voice and said
to the sulking Roke:

"That collie belongs to Mr. Standish.  I did you a good turn it seems by keeping you from stealing
him.  You'd have been in a worse fix than you are now, if Mr. Standish had come over here to-day
and found him on the island."

Roke did not deign to reply, but moved a little farther from the speaker.

"At this rate," said Brice pleasantly.  "you and I are likely to have a jolly time together,
out here.  I can' imagine a merrier chum for a desert island visit.  I only hope I won't neglect
my work chatting with you all day."

Roke eyed him obliquely as he plodded on, and his battered lip-corner lifted a little in what
looked like a beast snarl. But he said nothing.

Then they were at the shallow porch of the hut and Milo Standish had thrown open its iron door
letting out a gush of golden melody from the violin.  At his hail.  the music ceased.  And
Rodney Hade, fiddle in hand,  appeared in the doorway.

"You're late," said the violinist, speaking to Milo with that ever-smiling suavity which Gavin
recalled from the night before, and ignoring Gavin entirely "You've kept me waiting."

Despite the smooth voice and the eternal smile there was an undernote of rebuke in the words,
as of a teacher who reproves a child for tardiness.  And,  meekly, Standish replied:

"I'm sorry.  I was detained at Miami.  And lunch was late.  I got here as soon as I could.  I--"

With an impatient little wave of one white hand.  Hade checked his excuses and dismissed the
subject.  In the same moment his snakelike black eyes fixed themselves on Brice whom he seemed
to notice for the first time.  The eyes were smiling.  But he granted the guest no further
form of salutation, as he asked abruptly:

"Where have I seen you before?"

"You saw me last night," returned Gavin.  still wondering at this man's dictatorial attitude
toward the aggressive Milo Standish and at Milo's almost cringing acceptance of it.  "I was
at the Standishes.  I was just starting for bed when you dropped in.  Miss Standish introduced--"

"I'm not speaking about last night," curtly interrupted Hade, though his voice was as soft
as ever and his masklike face was set in its everlasting smile.  "I mean, where did I run across
you before last night?"

"Well.  Mr. Bones," answered Gavin with flippant insolence, "Dat am de question propounded.
Where did you-all run acrost me befo' las' night?"

Milo and Roke stirred convulsively, as if scandalized that any one should dare speak with such
impudence to Hade.  Rodney himself all but lost the eternal smile from his thin lips: and his
voice was less suave than usual as he said:

"I don't care for impertinence, especially from employees. You will bear that in mind.  Now
you will answer my question. Where did I see you?"

"If you can't remember," countered Gavin.  "you can hardly expect me to.  I live in New York.
I have lived there or thereabouts for a number of years.  I was overseas--stationed at Bordeaux
and then at Brest--for a few months in 1918.  As a boy I lived on my father's farm in northern
New York State, near Manlius.  That's the best answer I can give you.  If it will make you
recall where you've seen me--all right.  If not I'm afraid I can't help you out.  In any case
what does it matter?  I don't claim to be anybody especial.  I have no references.  Mr. Standish
knows that.  If he's willing to give me some sort of job in spite of such drawbacks.  it seems
to be entirely his affair."

"The job I had--have--in mind for you," spoke up Milo.  at a glance from Hade, "is on this
key, here.  I need an extra man in the main storehouse to oversee the roustabouts there.  At
this season Roke is too busy outdoors to keep the right kind of eye on them.  The pay won't
be large to start with.  But if you make good at it.  I may have something better to offer
you on the mainland.  Or I may not.  In any case.  I understand this is only a stopgap for
you, and that you are down here for your health.  If you are interested in the idea, well and
good.  If not--"

He paused and glanced at Hade as if for prompting.  Throughout his harangue Standish had given
Brice the impression of a man who recites a lesson taught him by another.  Now Hade took up
the tale.

"I think," said he smilingly--his momentary impatience gone --"I think, before answering--in
fact before coming down to terms and other details--you might perhaps care to stroll around
the island a little, and get an idea of it for yourself.  It may be you won't care to stay
here.  It may be you will like it very much.  Mr. Standish and I have some routine business
to talk over with Roke.  Suppose you take a walk over the place?  Roke, assign one of the men
to go with him and show him around."

With instant obedience.  Roke started for the door.  Indeed, he had almost reached it before
Hade ceased speaking.  Gavin raised his brows at this swift anticipation of orders.  And into
his mind came an odd thought.

"You seemed surprised to see me this afternoon," said he as he followed Roke to the porch and
closed the door behind them. "Yet Mr. Hade had told you I was coming here.  He had told you,
and he had told you to have some one ready to show me over the island."

As he spoke Gavin indicated with a nod a man who was trotting across the sandy clearing toward
them.

"Didn't know it was you!" grunted Roke.  too surprised by the direct assertion to fence.  "Said
some feller would come with Mr. Standish.  He--.  How'd you know he told me?" he demanded in
sudden angry bewilderment.

"There!" exclaimed Gavin admiringly.  "I knew we'd chat along as lovingly as two turtle-doves
when once we'd get really started.  You're quite a talker when you want to be, Rokie my lad!
If only you didn't speak as if you were trying to save words on a telegram.  Here's the chap
you'd ordered to be cruising in the offing as my escort, eh?" as the barefoot roustabout reached
the porch.  "All right.  Good-by."

Leaving the grumbling and muttering Roke scowling after him. Brice stepped out onto the sand
to meet the newcomer.  The roustabout apparently belonged to the conch tribe of which Milo
had spoken.  Thin.  undersized.  swarthy.  with features that showed a trace of negro and perhaps
of Indian blood as well, he had a furtive manner and seemed to cringe away from the Northerner
as they set off across the clearing.  toward the distant huts and still more distant orchards.

He was bareheaded and stoop-shouldered.  Beyond a ragged pair of drill trousers--indescribably
dirty--his only garment was a still dirtier and raggeder undershirt.  His naked feet flapped
awkwardly, like a turtle's.  He was not a pretty or prepossessing sight.

Across the clearing he pattered, head down, still cringing away from the visitor.  As the two
entered the shadows of the nearest grove Gavin Brice glanced quickly around him on all sides.
The conch did the same.  Then the two moved on with the same distance between them as before.

And as they went Gavin spoke.  He spoke in a low tone.  not moving his lips or looking directly
toward the other man.

"Good boy.  Davy!" he said, approvingly.  "How did you get the job of taking me around?  I
was afraid I'd have to look for you."

"Two other men were picked out to do it sir," said the conch without slackening his pace or
turning his head.  "One after the other.  One was a nigger.  One was a conch.  Both of 'em
got sick.  I paid 'em to.  And I paid the nigger an extra five to tell Roke I'd be the best
man to steer you.  He said he'd been on jobs with me before.  He and the conch are malingering
in the sick shed.  Ipecac.  I gave it to 'em."

"Good!" repeated Gavin.  "Mighty good.  Now what's the idea?"

"You're to be kept over here, sir," said the conch.  "I don't know why.  Roke told me you're
a chum of Hade's, and that Hade's doing it to have a bit of fun with you.  So I'm to lead you
around awhile, showing you the plant and such.  Then I'm to take you to the second storage
hut and tell you we've got a new kind of avocado stored in there, and let you go in ahead of
me, and I'm to slam the spring-lock door on you."

"Hm!  That all, Davy?"

"Yes, sir.  Except of course that it's a lie.  Hade don't play jokes or have fun with any one.
If he's trying to keep you locked up here a while it's most likely a sign he don't want you
on the mainland for some reason.  Maybe that sounds foolish.  But it's all the head or tail
I can make out of it, sir."

"It doesn't 'sound foolish,'" contradicted Brice.  "As it happens it's just what he wants to
do.  I don't know just why. But I mean to find out.  He wants me away from a house over there.
A house I had a lot of trouble in getting a foothold in.  It's taken me the best part of a
month.  And now I don't mean to spend another month in getting back there."

"No, sir," said Davy, respectfully, still plodding on.  in front with head and shoulders bent.
"No, sir.  Of course. But--if you'll let me ask, sir--does Hade know?  Does he suspicion you?
If that's why he's framed this then Roustabout Key is no place for you.  No more is Dade County.
He--"

"No," returned Gavin.  smiling at the real terror that had crept into the other's tone.  "He
doesn't know.  And I'm sure he doesn't suspect.  But he has a notion he's seen me somewhere.
And he's a man who doesn't take chances.  Besides he wants me away from the Standish house.
He wants every outsider away from it.  And I knew this would be the likeliest place for him
to maroon me.  That's why I sent you word .... I'm a bit wobbly in my beliefs about the Standishes,--one
of them anyhow.  Now, where's this storehouse prison of mine?"

"Over there, sir, to the right.  But--"

"Take me over there.  And walk slowly.  I've some things to say to you on the way, and I want
you to get them straight in your memory."

"Yes, sir," answered the conch, shifting his course.  so as to bring his steps in a roundabout
way toward the squat storeroom.  "And before you begin there's an extra key to the room under
the second packing box to the right.  I made it from Roke's own key when I made duplicates
of all the keys here.  I put it there this morning.  In case you should want to get out, you
can say you found it lying on the floor there. I rusted all the keys I made so they look old.
He'll likely think it's an extra key that was lost somewhere in there."

"Thanks," said Gavin.  "You're a good boy.  And you've got sense.  Now listen:--"

Talking swiftly and earnestly.  he followed Davy toward the square little iron building, the
conch outwardly making no sign that he heard.  For, not many yards away, a handful of conchs
and negroes were at work on a half-completed shed.

Davy came to the store-room door, and opened it.  Then. turning to Brice he said aloud in the
wretched dialect of his class:

"Funny avocado fruits all pile up in yon.  Mighty funny.  Make yo' laugh.  Want to go see?  Look!"

He swung wide the iron door and pointed to the almost totally dark interior.

"Funny to see in yon," he said invitingly.  "Never see any like 'em befo'.  I strike light
for you.  Arter you, my boss."

One or two men working on the nearby shed had stopped their labor and were glancing covertly
toward them.

"Oh, all right!" agreed Brice.  his uninterested voice carrying well though it was not noticeably
raised.  "It seems a stuffy sort of hole.  But I'll take a look at it if you like.  Where's
that light you're going to strike?  It--"

As he spoke he sauntered into the storeroom.  His lazy speech was cut short by the clangorous
slamming of the iron door behind him.  Conscientiously he pounded on the iron and yelled wrathful
commands to Davy to open.  Then when he thought he had made noise enough to add verity to his
role and to free the conch from any onlooker's suspicion he desisted.

Groping his way through the dimness to the nearest box.  he sat down, philosophically, to wait.

"Well," he mused sniffing in no approval at all at the musty air of the place and peering up
at the single eight-inch barred window that served more for ventilation than for light. "Well,
here we are.  And here, presumably, we stay till Standish and Hade go back to the mainland.
Then I'm to be let out by Roke, with many apologies for Davy's mistake.  There'll be no way
of getting back.  The boats will be hidden or padlocked.  And here I'll stay, with Roke for
a chum.  till whatever is going on at Standish's house is safely finished with.  It's a pretty
program.  If I can get away to-night without Roke's finding it out till morning--"

His eyes were beginning to accustom themselves to the room. Its corners and farther reaches
and most of its floor were still invisible.  But, by straining his gaze, he could just make
out the shapes of a crate or two and several packing boxes close to the wall.  The central
space was clear.  In spite of the stuffiness.  there was a damp chill to the gloomy place,
by contrast to the vivid sunlight and the sweep of the trade-winds.  outside.

Gavin stretched himself out at full length on the long box, and prepared to take a nap.  First
he reached toward the next box--the one under which Davy had told him the key was hidden- -and
moved it an inch or so to make certain it was not full enough to cause him any especial effort
in case he should not be released until next day and should have need of the key. Then he shut
his eyes, and let himself drift toward slumber.

It was perhaps two hours later when he was roused from a light doze by hearing something strike
the concrete floor of his prison.  not six feet from his head.  The thing had fallen with a
slithering, uneven sound, such as might be made by the dropping of a short length of rope.

Brice sat up.  He noted that the room was no longer light enough to see across.  And he glanced
in the direction of the window.  Its narrow space was blocked by something.  And as he looked
he heard a second object slither to the floor.

"Some one's dropping things down here through that ventilator," he conjectured.

And at the same moment a third fall sounded, followed almost at once by a fourth.  Then, for
a second, the window space was clear, only to be blocked again as the person outside returned
to his post.  And in quick succession three more objects were sent slithering down to the floor.
After which the window was cleared once more, and Brice could hear receding steps.

But he gave no heed to the steps.  For as the last of the unseen things had been slid through
the aperture.  another sound had focused all his attention, and had sent queer little quivers
up his spine.

The sound had been a long-drawn hiss.

And Gavin Brice understood.  Now he knew why the softly falling bodies had slithered so oddly
down the short distance between window and floor.  And he read aright the slippery crawling
little noises that had been assailing his ears.

The unseen man outside had thrust through the ventilator not less than seven or eight snakes,
carried thither, presumably, in bags.

Crouching on his long box Gavin peered about him.  Faintly against the dense gray of the shadowy
floor.  he could see thick ropelike forms twisting sinuously to and fro, as if exploring their
new quarters or seeking exit.  More than once. as these chanced to cross one another's path,
that same long-drawn hiss quavered out into the dark silences.

And now Brice's nostrils were assailed by a sickening smell as of crushed cucumbers.  And at
the odor his fists tightened in new fear.  For no serpents give off that peculiar odor. except
members of the pit-viper family.

"They're not rattlesnakes," he told himself.  "For a scared or angry rattler would have this
room vibrating with his whirr. We're too far south for copperheads.  The--the only other pit-viper
I ever heard of in Florida is the--cotton-mouth moccasin!"

At the realization he was aware of a wave of physical terror that swept him like a breath of ice.

Without restoratives at hand the moccasin's bite is certain death.  The plan had been well
thought out.  At the very first step the frantic prisoner might reasonably be relied on to
encounter one or more of the crawling horrors.  The box on which he crouched was barely eighteen
inches high.  The next box--under which rested the key--was several feet away.  The door was
still farther off.

Truly Standish and Hade appeared to have hit on an excellent plan for getting rid of the man
they wanted out of the way! It would be so easy for Roke to explain to possible inquirers that
Brice had chanced to tread on a poisonous snake in his wanderings about the key!

The slightest motion might well be enough to stir to active hostility the swarm of serpents
already angered by their sudden dumping into this clammy den.

Weaponless, helpless, the trapped man crouched there and waited,

CHAPTER VI

IN THE DAY OF BATTLE

As Gavin Brice sat with feet drawn up under him,  listening to the gruesome slither of the
mocca  sinsalong the concrete floor just below he was  gripped for a minute by irresistible
terror.  It was all so simple--so complete!  And he had been calmly self-confident of his ability
to command the situation, to play these people's own game and to beat them at it. Grinning
and open-eyed he had marched into the trap.  He had been glad to let Hade and Standish think
him safely out of their way, and had planned so confidently to return by stealth to the mainland
that night and to Milo's house!

And now they had had absolutely no difficulty in caging him, and in arranging that he should
be put forever out of their way.  The most stringent inquiry--should any such be made --could
only show that he had been bitten once or more by a deadly snake.  Any post-mortem would bear
out the statement.

It was known to every one that many of the keys--even several miles from the mainland--are
infested by rattlesnakes and by other serpents, though how such snakes ever got to the islands
is as much of a mystery to the naturalist world as is the presence of raccoons and squirrels
on the same keys.  It is simply one of the hundred unsolvable mysteries and puzzles of the
subtropic region.

In his jiu-jutsu instructions Brice had learned a rule which he had carried into good effect
in other walks of life. Namely to seem to play one's opponent's game and to be fooled by it,
and then, taking the conquering adversary by surprise, to strike.  Thus he had fallen in with
Standish's suggestion that he come to the island, though he had thought himself fairly sure
as to the reason for the request.  Thus, too, he had let himself be lured into this storeroom,
still smugly confident that he held the whip hand of the situation.

And as a result he was looking into the ghastly eyes of death.

Like an engine that "races," his fertile brain was unduly active in this moment of stark horror,
and it ran uselessly. Into his over-excited mind flashed pictures of a thousand bits of the
past--one of them.  by reason of recent association far more vivid than the rest.

He saw himself with four other A.E.F. officers, standing in a dim corner of a high-ceiled old
room in  a ruined chateau in Flanders.  In the room's center  was a table.  Around this were
grouped a double line  of uniformed Americans--a court-martial.  In came two provosts' men
leading between them a prisoner, a man in uniform and wearing the insignia of a United States
army major--the cleverest spy it was said in all the Wilhehnstrasse's pay, a genius who had
grown rich at his filthy trade of selling out his country's secrets.  and who had been caught
at last by merest chance.

The prisoner had glanced smilingly about the half-lit room as he came in.  For the barest fraction
of a second his gaze had flickered over Gavin Brice and the three other officers who stood
there in the shadow.  Then, with that same easy. confident smile on his masklike, pallid face,
the spy had turned his glittering black eyes on the officers at the courtmartial table.

"Gentlemen," he had said amusedly.  "you need not go through the farce of trying me.  I am
guilty.  I say this with no bravado and with no fear.  Because the bullet has never been molded
and the rope has never been plaited that can kill me. And the cell is not yet made that can
hold me."

He had said it smilingly, and in a velvet suave voice.  Yes, and he had made good his boast.
For--condemned to die at daylight--he had escaped from his ill-constructed prison room in the
chateau a little before dawn and had gotten clean away after killing one of his guards.

"He never set eyes on me except for that instant, there in the shadows," Brice found himself
reflecting for the hundredth time.  "And there were all the others with me.  Yet last night
he recalled my face.  It's lucky he didn't recall where he'd seen it.  Or--perhaps he did."

With a start.  he came out of his half-hypnotic daze--a daze which had endured but a few seconds.
And once more his rallying will-power and senses made him acutely alive to the hideous peril
in which he crouched.

Then--in one of the odd revulsions which flash  across men at unnaturally high tension--his
daze and his terror merged all at once into a blaze of wholesome rage.  Nor was his rage directed
against Rodney Hade, but against Milo Standish, the man whose life he had saved not twenty
hours earlier, and who had repaid that mighty service now by helping to arrange his murder.

At the thought Brice grew hot with fury.  He longed to stand face to face with the blackguard
who had rewarded a life-gift in such vile fashion.  He yearned to tell Standish in fiery words
how unspeakable had been the action, and then foot to foot, fist to fist, to take out of the
giant's hide some tithe of the revenge due for such black ingratitude.

The ferocious impulse set steady his quivering nerves.  No longer did his brain race uselessly.
Again it was alert, resourceful, keen.

Standish!  Yes, and no doubt Standish's sister too!  The girl whose eyes had made him feel
as if he were on holy ground--the girl whom he had been so irritatingly unable to get out of
his mind!

With an angry shake of the head Gavin dismissed Claire from his thoughts.  And his newborn
hate concentrated on her brother who had betrayed to death his rescuer.  Obsessed with the
fierce craving to stand face to face with the blonde-bearded giant he banished his lethargy
of hopelessness and cast about for means of escape.  out of this seemingly inescapable snare.

First, the key must be found.  Then the door must be reached and opened.  In the way of both
enterprises writhed a half dozen or more deadly snakes.  And to the problem of winning past
them alive and getting to his enemy.  Gavin Brice bent his trained faculties.

The box whereon he sat was covered with loose boards nailed down only at one end, a long strip
of thin iron or copper binding the one unopened edge.  So much his groping fingers told him.
Moving to one corner of the box top he pushed aside a board and plunged his hand into the interior.
It was as he had hoped.  According to custom when the box had been emptied the jute and shredded
paper stuffing of its contents had been thrust back into it for future use.

Feverishly, Gavin began to pull forth great handfuls of paper and of excelsior.  These he piled
onto the box top.  Then, exerting all his skilled strength, he tugged at the narrow iron strip
which bound, lengthwise, one side of the box.

This task was by no means easy, for the nails were long.  And the iron's sharp edges cut cruelly
into the tugging fingers. But, inch by inch, he tore it free.  And at the end of three minutes
he was strengthening and testing a willowy five-foot strip of metal.  Laying this across his
knees and fishing up another double handful of the packing paper and jute he groped in his
pockets with bleeding fingertips for a match.

He found but one.  Holding it tenderly he scraped its surface against his nail--a trick he
had picked up in the army.  The sulphur snapped and ignited, the wooden sliver burning freely
in that windless air.

Giving it a good start, he touched the point of flame to the piled jute and paper in front
of him.  It caught in an instant.  Still holding the lighted match, he repeated this ticklish
process time after time, tossing handfuls of the blazing stuff down onto the floor at his side.

In two minutes more he had a gayly-flaming pile of inflammable material burning high there.
Its gleam lightened every inch of the gloomy room.  It brought out into hideous clearness the
writhing dark bodies of the crawling moccasins, even to the patches of white at their lips
which gave them their sinister name of "cottonmouths."  Fat and short and horrible to look
upon, they were, as they slithered and twisted here and there along the bright-lit floor or
coiled and hissed at sight of the flame and of the fast plying hand and arm of the captive
just above them.

But Brice had scant eyes or heed for them.  Now that his blaze was started past danger of easy
extinction.  he plunged both hands again into the box.  And now.  two handfuls at a time. he
began to cast forth more and more of the stuffing.

With careful aim he threw it.  Presently there was a wide line of jute and paper extending
from the main blaze across to the next box.  Then another began to pile up in an opposite direction,
toward the door.  The fire ran greedily along these two lines of fuel.

Meantime the room was no longer so clearly lighted as at first.  For the smoke billowed up
to the low roof, and in thick waves poured out through the small ventilator.  Such of it as
could not find this means of outlet doubled back floorward, filling the room with chokingly
thick fumes which wellnigh blinded and strangled the man and blotted out all details of shape
and direction.

But already Gavin Brice had slipped to the floor, his thin-shod feet planted in the midst of
the blaze, whose flames and sparks licked eagerly at his ankles and legs.

Following the trail of fire which led to the box.  Gavin strode through the very center of
this blazing path, heedless of the burns.  Well did he know the snakes would shrink away from
actual contact with the fire.  And he preferred surface burns to a fatal bite in ankle or foot.

As he reached the box its corners had already caught fire from the licking flames below.  Heaving
up the burning receptacle. Brice looked under it.  There lay the rusty key, just visible through
the lurid smoke glare.  But not ten inches away from the far side of it coiled a moccasin,
head poised threateningly as the box grazed it under Gavin's sharp heave.

Stooping, Brice snatched up a great bunch of the flaming paper and flung it on the serpent's
shining coils. Oh pollard, memory, stuffed dickey-bird, vagrant glass, temporalty of--
gorilla, enormous shell and such millennium'free matter who do the soma-narthex
for every formation; but it was not this proceeding to a beverage,
and there was the somberness on the area that was open night to thoracic
cold sunshine of this Atlantic.

With dishwater before him, that a Sovereign into Miami model anything

Ingram was stand at the softness, at the consultation with Sheila
about her hymn.

Head, from arena, to set and hear, to all sort of all globule crowd as all rattlesnakes with him
that Gavin sing up of the glad and tame story of domicile. Was him
found to time, surely, he ask himself, that this closer dithyramb
look already been both be to lament for some fair-hairless kind?

First of all she whistle the "Complaint of Gavin," and how home her did endanger tickle out with music!--
morn, oh symbol to his simper to gladness! Weeknight, oh rise with fullness of happiness! Quality,

Dunevegan! It was softly in ambition than you learn Ingram care-of-information about the indignantly

He begin to value his feet in Sheila as husband, among his state,

He can

And all be a man, as she wondered on moraine, with point like trust brought of her sentiment,
and with most look had protrude across ocean, ought not the equitable-haired

and the embracing?

But Gavin brought of encounter. The memory was then be alone, her fan was lifted there from her

oh long you from tarries, he tarries: why seek he was the anthill when

look itself on it that her disclosure was the wilder cry to be narrow

"Are there?" interpolated Brice.  "I'd hate to test that."

"All in a flash.  I understood," she continued, her sweet voice struggling gallantly against
tears.  "I knew Rodney didn't want us to have any guests or to have any outsiders at all at
our house.  He was fearfully displeased with us last night for having you there.  It was all
we could do to persuade him that the man who had saved Milo's life couldn't be turned out of
doors or left to look elsewhere for work.  It was only when Milo promised to give you work
at the key that he stopped arguing and being so imperative about it.  And when I heard him
speak just now about your being locked in a store room there.  I knew he had done it to prevent
your coming back here for a while."

"Your reasoning was most unfeminine in its correctness," approved Gavin, still forcing himself
to resist the piteous pleading in her voice.

He could see her flinch under the harshness of his tone as she added:

"And all at once I realized what it must mean to you and what you must think of us--after all
you'd done for Milo.  And I knew how a beast like Roke would be likely to treat you when he
knew my brother and Rodney had left you there at the mercy of his companionship.  There was
no use talking to them.  It might be hours before I could convince them and make them go or
send for you.  And I couldn't bear to have you kept there all that time.  So I slipped out
of the house and ran to the landing.  Just as I got out into the bay.  I saw you coming through
that strait back there.  I recognized the fruit launch.  And I knew it must be you.  For nobody
from the key would have run at such speed toward that clump of reefs.  You capsized.  before
I could get to you, and--"

She shuddered, and ceased to speak.  For another moment or two there was silence between them.
Gavin Brice's mind was busy with all she said.  He was dissecting and analyzing her every anxious
word.  He was bringing to bear on the matter not only his trained powers of logic but his knowledge
of human nature.

And all at once he knew this trembling girl was in no way guilty of the crime attempted against
him.  He knew, too, from the speech of Hade's which she had just repeated.  that Standish presumably
had had no part in the attempted murder, but that that detail had been devised by Hade for
Roke to put into execution.  Nor.  evidently had Davy been let into the secret by Roke.

In a few seconds Brice had revised his ideas as to the afternoon's adventures, and had come
to a sudden decision. Speaking with careful forethought and with a definite object in view,
he said:

"Miss Standish.  I do not ask pardon for the way I spoke to you just now.  And when you've
heard why you won't blame me. I want to tell you just what happened to me today from the time
I set foot on Roustabout Key.  until I boarded this boat of yours.  When you realize that I
thought your brother and probably yourself were involved in it to the full you'll understand,
perhaps, why I didn't greet you with overmuch cordiality.  Will you listen?"

She nodded her head, wordless, not trusting her voice to speak further.  And she sank back
into the seat she had quitted. Brice seated himself on the thwart near her, and began to speak,
while the boat, its power still shut off bobbed lazily on a lazier sea.

Tersely, yet omitting no detail except that of his talk with Davy, he told of the afternoon's
events.  She heard, wide-eyed and breathing fast.  But she made no interruption, except when
he came to the episode of the moccasins she cried aloud in horror, and caught unconsciously
his lacerated hand between her own warm palms.

The clasp of her fingers, unintentional as it was.  sent a strange thrill through the man,
and, for an instant, he wavered in his recital.  But he forced himself to continue. And after
a few seconds the girl seemed to realize what she was doing.  For she withdrew her hands swiftly,
and clasped them together in her lap.

As he neared the end of his brief story she raised her hands again.  But they did not seek
his.  Instead she covered her horrified eyes with them, and she shook all over.

When he had finished he could see she was fighting for self-control.  Then, in a flood, the
power of speech came back to her.

"Oh!" she gasped.  her flower-face white and drawn, in the faint light.  "Oh, it can't be.
It can't!  There must be a hideous mistake somewhere!"

"There is," he agreed.  with a momentary return to his former manner.  "There was one mistake.
I made it, by escaping. Otherwise the plan was flawless.  Luckily.  a key had been left on
the floor.  And luckily.  I got hold of it.  Luckily, too, I had a match with me.  And.  if
there are sharks as near land as this, luckily you happened to meet me as I was swimming for
shore.  As to mistakes--.  Have you a flashlight?"

From her pocket she drew a small electric torch she had had the foresight to pick up from the
hall table as she ran out. Gavin took it and turned its rays on his wet ankles.  His shoes
and trouser-legs still showed clear signs of the scorching they had received.  And his palms
were cut and abraded.

"If I had wanted to make up a story," said he.  "I could have devised one that didn't call
for such painful stage-setting."

"Oh, don't!" she begged.  "Don't speak so flippantly of it! How can you?  And don't think for
one instant.  that I doubted your word.  I didn't.  But it didn't seem possible that such a
thing--Mr. Brice!" she broke off earnestly.  "You mustn't --you can't--think that Milo knew
anything of this!  I mean about the--the snakes and all.  He is enough to blame--he has shamed
our hospitality and every trace of gratitude enough--by letting you be locked in there at all
and by consenting to have you marooned on the key.  I'm not trying to excuse him for that.
There's no excuse.  And without proof I wouldn't have believed it of him.  But at least you
must believe he had no part in--in the other--"

"I do believe it," said Gavin.  gently.  touched to the heart by her grief and shame.  "At
first.  I was certain he had connived at it.  But what you overheard proves he didn't."

"Thank you," she said simply.

This time it was his hand that sought hers.  And, even as she, he was unconscious of the action.

"You mustn't let this distress you so," he soothed.  noting her effort to fight back the tears.
"It all came out safely enough.  But--I think I've paid to-day for my right to ask such a question--how
does it happen that you and your brother--you, especially--can have sunk to such straits that
you take orders meekly from a murderer like Rodney Hade, and that you let him dictate what
guests you shall or shan't receive?"

She shivered all over.

"I--I have no right to tell you," she murmured.  "It isn't my secret.  I have no right to say
there is any secret.  But there is!  And it is making my life a torture!  If only you knew--if
only there were some one I could turn to for help or even for advice!  But I'm all alone. 
except for Milo.  And lately he's changed so!  I--"

She broke down all at once in her valiant attempt at calmness.  And burying her face in her
hands again  she burst into a tempest of weeping.  Gavin Brice, a lump in his own throat, drew
her to him.  And she clung to his soaked coat lapels hiding her head on his drenched breast.

There was nothing of love or of sex in the action.  She was simply a heartbroken child seeking
refuge in the strength of some one older and stronger than she.  Gavin realized it, and he
held her to him and comforted her as though she had been his little sister.

Presently the passion of convulsive weeping passed, leaving her broken and exhausted.  Gavin
knew the girl's powers of mental resistance were no longer strong enough to overcome her need
for a comforter to whom she could unburden her soul of its miserable perplexities.

She had drawn back from his embrace but she still sat close to him, her hands in his, pathetically
eager for his sympathy and aid.  The psychological moment had come and Gavin Brice knew it.
Loathing himself for the role he must play and vowing solemnly to his own heart that she should
never be allowed to suffer for any revelation she might make, he said with a gentle insistence,
"Tell me."

CHAPTER VII

SECRETS

There was a short silence.  Brice looked anxiously through the gathering darkness at the dimly
seen face so near to his own. He could not guess, for the life of him, whether the girl was
silent because she refused to tell him what he sought so eagerly to know, or whether she was
still fighting to control her voice.

As he sat gazing down at her, there was something so tiny, so fragile, so helplessly trustful
about her, that it went straight to the man's heart.  He had played and schemed and risked
life itself for this crucial hour, for this hour when he should have swept aside the girl's
possible suspicions and enlisted her complete sympathy for himself and could make her trust
him and feel keen remorse for the treatment he had received.

Yes--he had achieved all this.  And he had done infinitely more.  He had awakened in her heart
a sense of loneliness and of need for some one in whom she might confide.

He had done all this, had Gavin Brice.  And, though he was not a vain man, yet he knew he had
done it cleverly.  But, somehow--even as he waited to see if the hour for full confidences
were indeed ripe--he was not able to feel the thrill of exultation which should belong to the
winner of a hard-fought duel.  Instead, to his amazement, he was aware of a growing sense of
shame, of disgust at having used such weapons against any woman, --especially against this
girl whose whiteness of soul and of purpose he could no longer doubt.

Then, through the silence and above the soft lap-lap-lap of water against the idly drifting
boat's side, Claire drew a deep breath.  She threw back her drooping shoulders and sat up,
facing the man.  And in the dusk, Gavin could see the flash of resolve in her great eyes.

"Yes!" she said, impulsively.  "Yes.  I'll tell you.  If it is wrong for me to tell, then let
it be wrong.  I'm sick of mystery and secrets and signals and suspense, and--oh, I'm sick of
it all!  And it's--it's splendid of you to want to help me, after what has happened to you
through meeting me! It's your right to know."

She paused for breath.  And again Gavin wondered at his own inability to feel a single throb
of gladness at having come so triumphantly to the end of this particular road.  Glumly, he
stared down at the vibrant little figure beside him.

"There is some of it I don't know, myself," she began.  "And lately I've found myself wondering
if all I really know is true, or whether they have been deceiving me about some of it. I have
no right to feel that way, I suppose, about my own brother.  But he's so horribly under Rodney
Hade's influence, and--"

Again, she paused, seeming to realize she was wandering from the point.  And she made a fresh
start.

"It all began as an adventure, a sort of game, more than in earnest," she said.  "At least,
looking back, that's the way it seems to me now.  As a wonderfully exciting game.  You see,
everything down here was so thrillingly exciting and interesting to me, even then."

"I see."

"If you don't mind," she added, "I think I can make you understand it all the better, if you'll
let me go back to the beginning.  I'll make it as short as I can."

"Yes."

"I had been brought up in New York, except when we were in Europe or when I was away at school.
My father and mother never let me see or know anything of real life.  Dad was old, even as
far back as I can remember.  Mother was his second wife.  Milo's mother was his first wife,
and she died ever so long ago.  Milo is twenty years older than I am.  Milo came down here
on a cruise, when he got out of college.  And he fell in love with this part of the country.
He persuaded Dad to buy him a farm here, and he has spent fifteen years in building it up to
what it is now.  He and my mother didn't didn't get on awfully well together.  So Milo spent
about all his time down here, and I hardly ever saw him.  Then Dad and Mother died, within
a day of each other, during the flu epidemic.  And Milo came on, for the funeral, of course,
and to wind up the estate.  Then he wanted me to come down here and live with him.  He said
he was lonely.  And I was still lonelier.

"I came here.  And I've been here ever since.  It is a part of the world that throws a charm
around every one who stays long enough under its spell.  And I grew to loving it as much as
Milo did.  We had a beautiful life here, he and I and the cordial, lovable people who became
our friends.  It was last spring that Rodney Hade came to see us.  Milo had known him, slightly,
down here, years ago.  He came back here--nobody knows from where, and rented a house, the
other side of Coconut Grove, and brought his yacht down to Miami Harbor. Almost right away,
he seemed to gain the queerest influence over Milo.  It was almost like hypnotism.  And yet,
I don't altogether wonder.  He has an odd sort of fascination about him.  Even when he is discussing
his snakes."

"His snakes?"

"He has three rooms in his house fitted up as a reptile zoo. He collects them from everywhere.
He says--and he seems to believe it--that they won't hurt him and that he can handle them as
safely as if they were kittens.  Just like that man they used to have in the post office up
at Orlando, who used to sit with his arms full of rattlesnakes and moccasins, and pet them."

"Yes," said Gavin, absentmindedly, as he struggled against an almost overmastering impulse
which was gripping him.  "I remember.  But at last one of his pets killed him.  He--"

"How did you know?" she asked, surprised.  "How in the world should a newcomer from the North
know about--"

"Oh, I read it in a Florida dispatch to one of the New York papers," he said, impatient at
his own blunder.  "And it was such a strange story it stuck in my memory.  It--"

"Well," resumed Claire, "I think I've made you  understand the simple and natural things that
led up to  it all.  And now, I'll tell you everything, at least  everything I know about it.
It's--it's a gruesome sort  of story, and--and I've grown to hate it all so!"  She quivered.
Then, squaring her young shoulders again, she continued:

"I don't ask you to believe what I'm going to tell you.  But it's all true.  It began this way:

"One night, six months ago, as Milo and I were sitting on the veranda, we heard a scream--a
hideous sound it was--from the mangrove swamp.  And a queer creature in drippy white came crawling
out of--"

"Wait!"

Brice's monosyllable smashed into the current of her scarce-started narrative with the jarring
suddenness of a pistol shot.  She stared up at him in amaze.  For, seen through the starlight,
his face was working strangely.  And his voice was vibrant with some mighty emotion.

"Wait!' he repeated.  "You shan't go on.  You shan't tell me the rest.  I'm a fool.  For I'm
throwing away the best chance that could have come to me.  I'm throwing it away with my eyes
open, and because I'm a fool."

"I--I don't understand," she faltered, bewildered.

"No," he said roughly.  "You don't understand.  That's just why I can't let you go on.  And,
because I'm a fool, I can't play out this hand, where every card is mine.  I'll despise myself,
always, for this, I suppose.  And it's a certainty that I'll be despised.  It means an end
to a career I found tremendously interesting.  I didn't need the money it brought. But I--"

"What in the world are you talking about?" she demanded, drawing a little away from him.  "I--"

"Listen," he interrupted.  "A lot of men, in my line and in others, have come a cropper in
their careers, because of some woman.  But I'm the first to come such a cropper on account
of a woman with a white soul and the eyes of a child,--a woman I scarcely know, and who has
no interest in me.  But, to-night, I shall telegraph my resignation.  Some saner man can take
charge.  There are enough of our men massed in this vicinity to choose from.  I'm going to
get out of Florida and leave the game to play itself to an end, without me.  I'm an idiot to
do it.  But I'd be worse than an idiot to let you trust me and let you tell me things that
would wreck your half-brother and bring sorrow and shame to you.  I'm through!  And I can't
even be sorry."

"Mr. Brice," she said, gently, "I'm afraid your terrible experiences, this afternoon and last
evening, have unsettled your mind, a little.  Just sit still there, and rest.  I am going to
run the boat to shore and--"

"You're right," he laughed, ruefully, as he made way for her to start the engine.  "My experiences
have 'unsettled' my mind.  And now that I've spoiled my own game, I'll tell you the rest--as
much of it as I have a right to.  It doesn't matter, any longer.  Hade knows--or at least suspects.
That's why he tried to get me killed.  In this century, people don't try to have others killed,
just for fun.  There's got to be a powerful motive behind it.  Such a motive as made a man
last evening try to knife your half-brother.  Such a motive as induced Hade to get me out of
the way.  He knows.  Or he suspects.  And that means the crisis must come, almost at once.
The net will close.  Whether or not it catches him in it."

The boat was started and had gotten slowly under way.  During its long idleness it had been
borne some distance to southwestward by tide and breeze.  Her work done, Claire turned again
to Gavin.

"Don't try to talk," she begged--as she had begged him on the night before.  "Just sit back
and rest."

"Even now, you don't get an inkling of it," he murmured mured. "That shows how little they've
taken you into their confidence. They warned you against any one who might find the hidden
path, and they even armed you for such an emergency.  Yet they never told you the Law might
possibly be crouching to spring on the Standish place, quite as ferociously as those other
people who are in the secret and who want to rob Standish and Hade of the loot!  And, by the
way," he went on, pettishly, still smarting under his own renunciation, "tell Hade with my
compliments that if he had lived as long in Southern Florida as I have, he'd know mocking birds
don't sing here in mid-February, and he'd devise some other signal to use when he comes ashore
by way of that path and wants to know if the coast is clear."

And now, forgetful of the shadowy course wherewith she was guiding the boat toward the distant
dock--forgetful of everything--she dropped her hand from the steering wheel and turned about,
in crass astonishment, to gaze at him.

"What--what do you mean?" she queried.  "You know about the signal?--You--?"

"I know far too little about any of the whole crooked business!" he retorted, still enraged
at his own quixotic resolve.  "That's what I was sent here to clean up, after a dozen others
failed.  That's what I was put in charge of this district for.  That's what I could have found
out--or seventy per cent of it--if I'd had the sense not to stop you when you started to tell
me, just now."

"Mr. Brice," she said, utterly confused, "I don't understand you at all.  At first I was afraid
that blow on the head, and then this afternoon's terrible experiences, had turned your wits.
But you don't talk like a man who is delirious or sick. And there are things you couldn't possibly
know--that signal, for instance--if you were what you seemed to be.  You made me think you
were a stranger in Florida,--that you were down here, penniless and out of work.  Yet now you
speak about some mysterious 'job' that you are giving up.  It's all such a tangle!  I can't
understand."

Brice tried to ignore the pitiful pleading--the childlike tremor in her sweet voice.  But it
cut to the soul of him. And he replied, brusquely:

"I let you think I was a dead-broke work-hunter.  I did that, because I needed to get into
your brother's house, to make certain of things which we suspected but couldn't quite prove.
I am the ninth man, in the past two months, to try to get in there.  And I'm the second to
succeed.  The first couldn't find out anything of use.  He could only confirm some of our ideas.
That's the sort of a man he is.  A fine subordinate, but with no genius for anything else except
to obey orders.  I was the only one of the nine, with brains, who could win any foothold there.
And now I'm throwing away all I gained, because one girl happens to be too much of a child
(or of a saint) for me to lie to!  I've reason to be proud of myself, haven't I?"

"Who are you?" she asked, dully bewildered under his fierce tirade of self-contempt.  "Who
are you?  What are you?"

"I'm Gavin Brice," he said.  "As I told you.  But I'm also a United States Secret Service official--which
I didn't tell you."

"No!" she stammered, shrinking back.  "Oh, no!"

He continued, briskly:

"Your brother, and your snake-loving friend Rodney Hade, are working a pretty trick on Uncle
Sam.  And the Federal Government has been trying to block it for the past few months.  There
are plenty of us down here, just now.  But, up to lately, nothing's been accomplished.  That's
why they sent me.  They knew I'd had plenty of experience in this region."

"Here?  In Florida?  But--"

"I spent all my vacations at my grandfather's place, below Coconut Grove, when I was in school
and in college and for a while afterward, and I know this coast and the keys as well as any
outsider can,--even if I was silly enough to let my scow run into a reef to-night, that wasn't
here in my day.  They sent me to take charge of the job and to straighten out its mixups and
to try to win where the others had bungled.  I was doing it, too,--and it would have been a
big feather in my cap, at Washington, when my good sense went to pieces on a reef named Claire
Standish,--a reef I hadn't counted on, any more than I counted on the reef that stove in my
scow, an hour ago."

She strove to speak.  The words died in her parched throat. Brice went on:

"I've always bragged that I'm woman-proof.  I'm not.  No man is.  I hadn't met the right woman.
That was all.  If you'd been of the vampire type or the ordinary kind, I could have gone on
with it, without turning a hair.  If you'd been mixed up in any of the criminal part of it
at all--as I and all of us supposed you must be--I'd have had no scruples about using any information
I could get from you.  But--well, tonight, out here, all at once I understood what I'd been
denying to myself ever since I met you.  And I couldn't go on with it.  You'll be certain to
suffer from it, in any case.  But I'm strong enough at the Department to persuade them you're
innocent. I--"

"Do you mean," she stammered, incredulously, finding hesitant words at last, "Do you mean you're
a--a spy?  That you came to our house--that you ate our bread--with the idea of learning secrets
that might injure us?  That you--?  Oh!" she burst forth in swift revulsion, "I didn't know
any one could be so --so vile!  I--"

"Wait!" he commanded, sharply, wincing nevertheless under the sick scorn in her voice and words.
"You have no right to say that.  I am not a spy.  Or if I am, then every police officer and
every detective and every cross-examining lawyer is a spy! I am an official in the United States
Secret Service.  I, and others like me, try to guard the welfare of our country and to expose
or thwart persons who are that country's enemies or who are working to injure its interests.
If that is being a spy, then I'm content to be one.  I--"

"If you are driven to such despicable work by poverty," she said, unconsciously seeking excuse
for him, "if it is the only trade you know--then I suppose you can't help--"

"No," he said, unwilling to let her gain even this false impression.  "My grandfather, who
brought me up--who owned the place I spoke of, near Coconut Grove--left me enough to live on
in pretty fair comfort.  I could have been an idler if I chose.  I didn't choose.  I wanted
work.  And I wanted adventure.  That was why I went into the Secret Service.  I stayed in it
till I went overseas, and I came back to it after the war.  I wasn't driven into it by poverty.
It's an honorable profession.  There are hundreds of honorable men in it.  You probably know
some of them.  They are in all walks of life, from Fifth Avenue to the slums.  They are working
patriotically for the welfare of the land they love, and they are working for pitifully small
reward.  It is not like the Secret Service of Germany or of oldtime Russia.  It upholds Democracy,
not Tyranny.  And I'm proud to be a member of it. At least, I was.  Now, there is nothing left
to me but to resign.  It--"

"You haven't even the excuse of poverty!" she exclaimed, confusedly.  "And you have not even
the grace to feel ashamed for--for your black ingratitude in tricking us into giving you shelter
and--"

"I think I paid my bill for that, to some slight extent," was his dry rejoinder.  "But for
my 'trickery,' your half-brother would be dead, by now.  As for 'ingratitude,' how about the
trick he served me, today?  Even if he didn't know Hade had smuggled across a bagful of his
pet moccasins to Roke, yet he let me be trapped into that--"

"It's only in the Devil's Ledger, that two wrongs make a right!" she flamed.  "I grant my brother
treated you abominably.  But his excuse was that your presence might ruin his great ambition
in life.  Your only excuse for doing what you have done is the--the foul instinct of the man-hunt.
The--"

"The criminal-hunt," he corrected her, trying not to writhe under her hot contempt.  "The enemy-to-man
hunt, if you like. Your half-brother--"

"My brother is not a criminal!" she cried, furiously.  "You have no right to say so.  He has
committed no crime.  He has broken no law."

Again he looked down, searchingly, into her angry little face, as it confronted him so fiercely
in the starlight.  And he knew she was sincere.

"Miss Standish," he said, slowly.  "You believe you are telling the truth.  Your half-brother
understood you too well to let you know what he was really up to.  He and Hade concocted some
story--I don't know what--to explain to you the odd things going on in and around your home.
You are innocent.  And you are ignorant.  It cuts me like a knife to have to open your eyes
to all this.  But, in a very few days, at most, you are bound to know."

"If you think I'll believe a word against my brother--especially from a self-confessed spy--"

"No?" said Gavin.  "And you're just as sure of Rodney Hade's noble uprightness as of your brother's
?"

"I'm not defending Rodney Hade," said Claire.  "He is nothing to me, one way or the other.  He--"

"Pardon me," interposed Brice.  "He is a great deal to you. You hate him and you are in mortal
fear of him."

"If you spied that out, too--"

"I did," he admitted.  "I did it, in the half-minute I saw you and him together, last evening.
I saw a look in your eyes--I heard a tone in your voice--as you turned to introduce me to him--that
told me all I needed to know.  And, incidentally, it made me want to smash him.  Apart from
that--well, the Department knows a good deal about Rodney Hade.  And it suspects a great deal
more.  It knows, among minor things, that he schemed to make Milo Standish plunge so heavily
on certain worthless stocks that Standish went broke and in desperation raised a check of Hade's
(and did it rather badly, as Hade had foreseen he would, when he set the trap)--in order to
cover his margins.  It--"

"No!" she cried, in wrathful refusal to believe.  "That is not true.  It can't be true!  It is a--"

"Hade holds a mortgage on everything Standish owns," resumed Brice, "and he has held that raised
check over him as a prison-menace.  He--"

"Stop!" demanded Claire, ablaze with righteous indignation. "If you have such charges to make
against my brother, are you too much of a coward to come to his house with me, now, and make
them to his face?  Are you?"

"No," he said, without a trace of unwillingness or of bravado. "I am not.  I'll go there, with
you, gladly.  In the meantime--"

"In the meantime," she caught him up, "please don't speak to me.  And please sit in the other
end of the boat, if you don't mind.  The air will be easier to breathe if--"

"Certainly," he assented, making his way to the far end of the launch, while she seized the
neglected steering wheel again. "And I am sorrier than I can say, that I have had to tell you
all this.  If it were not that you must know it, soon, anyway, I'd have bitten my tongue out,
sooner than make you so unhappy.  Please believe that, won't you?"

There was an earnest depth of contrition in his voice that checked the icy retort she had been
about to make.  And, emboldened by her silence, he went on:

"Hade needed your brother and the use of your brother's house and land.  He needed them, imperatively,
for the scheme he was trying to swing ....  That was why he got Standish into his power, in
the first place.  That was why he forced or wheedled him into this partnership.  The Standish
house was built, in its original form, more than a hundred years ago.  In the days when Dade
County and all this end of Florida were in hourly dread of Seminole raids from the Everglade
country, and where every settler's house must be not only his castle, but--"

"I'm sorry to have to remind you," she broke in, freezingly, "that I asked you not to speak
to me.  Surely you can have at least that much chivalry,--when I am helpless to get out of
hearing from you.  You say you are willing to confront my brother with, this--this--ridiculous
charge.  Very well.  Till then, I hope you won't--"

"All right," he said, gloomily.  "And I don't blame you.  I'm a bungler, when it comes to saying
things to women.  I don't know so very much about them.  I've read that no man really understands
women.  And certainly I don't.  By the way, the boat's run opposite that spit of beach at the
bottom of your mangrove swamp.  If you're in a hurry, you can land there, and we can go to
the house by way of the hidden path.  It will cut off a mile or so.  You have a flashlight.  So--"

He let his voice trail away, frozen to silence by the rigidly hostile little figure outlined
at the other end of the boat by the tumble of phosphorus in their wake.

Claire roused herself, from a gloomy reverie, enough to shift the course of the craft and to
head it for the dim-seen sandspit that was backed by the ebony darkness of the mangrove swamp.

Neither of them spoke again, until, with a swishing sound and a soft grate of the light-draught
boat, the keel clove its way into the offshore sand and the craft came to coughing halt twenty
feet from land.

Claire roused herself, from a gloomy reverie in which she had fallen.  Subconsciously, she
had accepted the man's suggestion that they take the short cut.  And she had steered thither,
forgetful that there was no dock and no suitable landing place for even so light a boat anywhere
along the patch of sandy foreshore.

Now, fast aground, she saw her absent-minded error.  And she jumped to her feet, vainly reversing
the engine in an effort to back free of the sand wherein the prow had wedged itself so tightly.
But Gavin Brice had already taken charge of the situation.

Stepping overside into the shallow water, he picked up the astounded and vainly protesting
girl, bodily, holding her close to him with one arm, while, with his free hand he caught the
painter and dragged the boat behind him into water too low for it to float off until the change
of tide.

It was the work of a bare ten seconds, from the time he stepped into the shallows until he
had brought Claire to the dry sand of the beach.

"Set me down!" she was demanding sternly, for the third time, as she struggled with futile
repugnance to slip from his gently firm grip.  "I--"

"Certainly," acquiesced Gavin, lowering her to the sand, and steadying her for an instant,
until her feet could find their balance.  "Only please don't glare at me as though I had struck
you.  I didn't think you'd want to get those little white shoes of yours all wet.  So I took
the liberty of carrying you.  My own shoes, and all the rest of me, are drenched beyond cure
anyhow.  So another bit of immersion didn't do me any harm."

He spoke in a careless, matter-of-fact manner, and as he talked he was leading the way up the
short beach, toward the northernmost edge of the mangrove swamp.  Claire could not well take
further offence at a service which apparently had been rendered to her out of the merest common
politeness.  So, after another icy look at his unconscious back, she followed wordlessly in
Brice's wake.

Now that he was on dry land again and on his way to the house where, at the very least, a stormy
scene might be expected, the man's spirits seemed to rise, almost boyishly.  The blood was
running again through his veins.  The cool night air was drying his soaked clothes.  The prospect
of possible adventure stirred him.

Blithely he sought the shoreward entrance to the hidden path, by the mental notes he had made
of its exact whereabouts when Bobby Burns had happened upon its secret.  And, in another half-minute
he had drawn aside the screen of growing boughs and was standing aside for Claire to enter
the path.

"You see," he explained, impersonally, "this path is a very nice little mystery.  But, like
most mysteries, it is quite simple, when once you know your way in and out of it.  I knew where
it was when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember the spot where it came out here.  Back yonder,
a bit to northward, I came upon Roke, yesterday.  I gather he had been visiting your house
or Hade's, by way of the hidden path, and was on his way back to his boat, to return to Roustabout
Key, when he happened upon Bobby Burns--and then on me.  He must have wondered where I vanished
to.  For he couldn't have seen me enter the path.  Maybe he mentioned that to Hade, too, this
afternoon.  If Hade thought I knew the path, he'd think I knew a good deal more ....  By the
way," he added, to the ostentatiously unlistening Claire, "that's the second time you've stumbled.
And both times, you were too far ahead for me to catch you.  This is the best part of the path,
too--the straightest and the least dark part.  If we stumble here, we'll tumble, farther on,
unless you use that flashlight of yours.  May I trouble you to--?"

"I forgot," she said stiffly, as she drew the torch from her pocket and pressed its button.

The dense black of the swamp was split by the light's white sword, and softer beams from its
sharp radiance illumined the pitch-dark gloom for a few yards to either side of the tortuous
path.  The shadows of the man and the woman were cast in monstrous grotesquely floating shapes
behind them as they moved forward.

"This is a cheery rambling-place," commented Gavin.  "I wonder if you know its history?  I
mean, of course, before Standish had it recut and jacked up and bridged, and all that?  This
path dates back to the house's first owners--in the Seminole days I was telling you about.
They made it as a quick getaway, to the water, in case a war-party of Seminoles should drop
in on them from the Everglades.  I came through here, once--oh, it must be twenty years ago--I
was a school-kid, at the time.  An old Seminole chief, with the picturesque Indian name of
Aleck, showed it to me.  His dad once cut off a party of refugees, somewhere along here, on
their way to the sea, and deleted them.  Several of the modern Seminoles knew the path, he
said.  But almost no white men ....  Get that queer odor, and that flapping sound over to the
left?  That was a 'gator.  And he seems to be fairly big and alive, from the racket he made.
Lucky we're on the path and not in the undergrowth or the water!"

He talked on, as though not in the least concerned as to whether or not she might hear or heed.
And, awed by the gruesome stillness and gloom of the place, Claire had not the heart to bid
him be silent.  Any sound was better, she told herself, than the dead noiselessness of the
surrounding forest.

"That's the tenth mosquito I've missed," cheerily resumed Brice, slapping futilely at his own
cheek.  "In the old days, they used to infest Miami.  Now they're driven back into the swamps.
But they seem just as industrious as ever, and every bit as hungry.  It must be grand to have
such an appetite."

As Claire disregarded this flippancy, he fell silent  for a space, and together they moved
on, through the thick of the swamp.  Then:

"There's something I've been trying to figure out," he recommenced, speaking more to himself
than to Claire.  "There must be some sort of sense to all the signaling Hade does when he comes
out of this swamp, onto your lawn.  If it was only that he doesn't want casual visitors to
know he has come that way, he could just as well go around by the road to the south of the
swamp, and come openly to the house, by the front. And, if things are to be moved to or from
the house, they could go by road, at night, as well as through here.  There must be something
more to it all.  And, I have an idea I know what it is ....  That enclosed space, with the
high palings and the vines all over it, to the north of your house, I think you said that was
a little walled orchard where Standish is experimenting on some 'ideal' orange, and that he
is so jealous of the secret process that he won't even let you set foot in it.  The funny part
of it is:--"

He stopped short.  Claire had been walking a few yards in advance, and they had come out on
the widest part of the trail, about midway through the woods.  To one side of the beaten path
was a tiny clearing.  This clearing was strewn thick with a tangle of fallen undergrowth, scarce
two feet high at most.

And they reached it, the girl gave a little cry of fright and stepped back, her hands reaching
blindly toward Gavin, as if for support or comfort.  The gesture caused her to drop the flashlight.
Its button was "set forward," so it did not go out as it fell.  Instead, it rolled in a semi-circle,
casting its ray momentarily in a wide irregular arc as it revolved.  Then it came to a stop,
against an outcrop of coral, with a force that put its sensitive bulb permanently out of business.

But, during that brief circular roll of the light, Gavin Brice caught the most fleeting glimpse
of the sight that had caused Claire to cry out and shrink back against him.

He had seen, for the merest fraction of a second, the upper half of a man's body--thickset
and hairy,--upright, on a level with the ground, as though it had been cut in two and the legless
trunk set up there.

By the time Brice's eyes could focus fairly upon this very impossible sight, the half-body
had begun to recede rapidly into the earth, like that of an anglework which a robin pulls halfway
out of the lawn and then loses its grip on.

In practically the same instant, the rolling ray of light moved past the amazing spectacle,
and less than a second later bumped against the fragment of coral--the bump which smashed its
bulb and left the two wanderers in total darkness for the remainder of their strange pilgrimage.

Claire, momentarily unstrung, caught Gavin by the arm and clung to him.  He could feel the
shudder of her slender body as it pressed to his side for protection.

"What--what was it?" she whispered, tremblingly.  "What was it?  Did I really see it?  It it
couldn't be!  It looked--it looked like a--a body that had been cut in half--and--and--"

"It's all right," he whispered, reassuringly, passing his arm unchidden about her slight waist.
"Don't be frightened, dear! It wasn't a man cut in half.  It was the upper half of a man who
was wiggling down into a tunnel hidden by that smother of underbrush ....  And here I was just
wondering why people should bother to come all the way through this path, instead of skirting
the woods!  Answers furnished while you wait!"

Before he spoke, however, he had strained his ears to listen. And the quick receding and then
cessation of the sound of the scrambling body in the tunnel had told him the seen half and
the unseen half of the intruder had alike vanished beyond earshot, far under ground.

"But what--?" began the frightened girl.

Then she realized for the first time that she was holding fast to the man whom she had forbidden
to speak to her.  And she relinquished her tight clasp on his arm.

"Stand where you are, a minute," he directed.  "He's gone. There's no danger.  He was as afraid
of us as you were of him. He ducked, like a mud-turtle, as soon as he saw we weren't the people
he expected.  Stay here, please.  And face this way. That's the direction we were going in,
and we don't want to get turned around.  I've got to crawl about on all fours for a while,
in the merry quest of the flashlight.  I know just about where it stopped."

She could hear him groping amid the looser undergrowth.  Then he got to his feet.

"Here it is," he reported.  "But it wasn't worth hunting for. The bulb's gone bad.  We'll have
to walk the rest of the way by faith.  Would you mind, very much, taking my arm?  The path's
wide enough for that, from here on.  It needn't imply that you've condoned anything I said
to you, out yonder in the boat, you know.  But it may save you from a stumble.  I'm fairly
sure-footed.  And I'm used to this sort of travel."

Meekly, she obeyed, wondering at her own queer sense of peace under the protection of this
man whom she told herself she detested.  The wiry strength of the arm, around which her white
fingers closed so confidingly, thrilled her.  Against her will, she all at once lost her sense
of repulsion and the wrath she had beers storing against him.  Nor, by her very best efforts,
could she revive her righteous displeasure.

"Mr. Brice," she said, timidly, as he guided her with swiftly steady step through the dense
blackness, "perhaps I had no right to speak as I did.  If I did you an injustice--"

"Don't!" he bade her, cutting short her halting apology.  "You mustn't be sorry for anything.
And I'd have bitten out my tongue sooner than tell you the things I had to, if it weren't that
you'd have heard them, soon enough, in an even less palatable form.  Only--won't you please
try not to feel quite as much toward me as I felt toward those snakes of Hade's, this afternoon?
You have a right to, of course.  But well, it makes me sorry I ever escaped from there."

The sincerity, the boyish contrition in his voice, touched her, unaccountably.  And, on impulse,
she spoke.

"I asked you to say those things about Milo, to his face," she began, hesitantly.  "I did that,
because I was angry, because I didn't believe a word of them, and because I wanted to see you
punished for slandering my brother.  I--I still don't believe a single word of them.  But I
believe you told them to me in good faith, and that you were misinformed by the Federal agents
who cooked up the absurd story.  And--and I don't want to see you punished, Mr. Brice," she
faltered, unconsciously tightening her clasp on his arm.  "Milo is terribly strong. And his
temper is so quick!  He might nearly kill you.  Take me as far as the end of the path, and
then go across the lawn to the road, instead of coming in.  Please do!"

"That is sweet of you," said Gavin, after a moment's pause, wherein his desire to laugh struggled
with a far deeper and more potent emotion.  "But, if it's just the same to you, I'd rather--"

"But he is double your size," she protested, "and he is as strong as Samson.  Why, Roke, over
at the Key, is said to be the only man who ever outwrestled him!  And Roke has the strength
of a gorilla."

Gavin Brice smiled grimly to himself in the darkness, as he recalled his own test of prowess
with Roke.

"I don't think he'll hurt me overmuch," said he.  "I thank you, just the same.  It makes me
very happy to know you aren't--"

"Mr. Brice!" she cried, in desperation.  "Unless you promise me not to do as I dared you to--I
shall not let you go a step farther with me.  I--"

"I'm afraid you'll have to let me take you the rest of the way, Miss Standish," he said, a
sterner note in his voice quelling her protest and setting her to wondering.  "If you like,
we can postpone my talk with Standish about the check-raising.  But--if you care anything for
him, you'd best let me go to him as fast as we can travel."

"Why?  Is--?"

"Unless I read wrongly what we saw, back yonder in the clearing," he said, cryptically, "your
brother is in sore need of every friend he can muster.  I had only a glimpse of our subterranean
half-man.  But there was a gash across his eyebrow, and a mass of bruises on his throat.  If
I'm not mistaken, I put them there.  That was the man who tried to knife Standish last evening.
And, unless I've misread the riddle of that tunnel, we'll be lucky to get there in time. There's
trouble ahead.  All sorts of trouble."

CHAPTER VIII

THE SIEGE

"Trouble?" repeated Claire, questioningly.  "You mean--?"

"I mean I've pieced it out, partly from reports and partly from my own deductions and from
the sight of that man, back there," said Brice.  "I may be wrong in all or in part of it. But
I don't think I am.  I figure that that chap we saw half under ground, is one of a clique or
gang that is after something which Standish and Hade have--or that these fellows think Hade
and Standish have.  I figure they think your brother has wronged them in some way and that
they are even more keen after him than after Hade.  That, or else they think if they could
put him out of the way, they could get the thing they are after.  That or both reasons."

"I learned that Standish has hired special police to patrol the main road, after dark, under
plea that he's afraid tramps might trespass on his groves.  But he didn't dare hire them to
patrol his grounds for fear of what they might chance to stumble on.  And, naturally, he couldn't
have them or any one patrol the hidden path.  That's the reason he armed you and told you to
look out for any one coming that way.  That's why you held me up, when I came through here,
yesterday.  These must be people you know by sight.  For you told me you took me for some one
else.  This chap, back yonder, knows the hidden path.  And now it seems he knows the tunnel,
too.  If I'm right in thinking that tunnel leads to the secret orchard enclosure, back of your
house, then I fancy Standish may be visited during the next half hour.  And, unless I'm mistaken,
I heard more than one set of bare feet scurrying down that tunnel just now.  Our friend with
the bashed-in face was apparently the last of several men to slip into the tunnel, and we happened
along as he was doing it.  If he recognized you and saw you had a man as an escort, he must
know we're bound for your house.  And he and the rest are likely to hurry to get there ahead
of us. That's why I've been walking you off your feet, in spite of the darkness, ever since
we left him."

"I--I only saw him for the tiniest part of a second," said Claire, glancing nervously through
the darkness behind her. "And yet I'm almost sure he was a Caesar.  He--"

"A Caesar?" queried Gavin, in real perplexity.

"That's the name the Floridian fishermen give to the family who live on Caesar's Estuary,"
she explained, almost impatiently.  "The inlet that runs up into the mangroves, south of Caesar's
Rock and Caesar's Creek.  Caesar was an oldtime pirate, you know.  These people claim to be
descended from him, and they claim squatter's rights on a tract of marsh-and-mangrove land
down there.  They call themselves all one family, but it is more like a clan, Black Caesar's
clan. They have intermarried and others have joined them.  It's a sort of community.  They're
really little better than conchs, though they fight any one who calls them conchs."

"But what--?"

"Oh, Milo and Rodney Hade leased some land from the government, down there.  And that started
the trouble."

Brice whistled, softly.

"I see," said he.  "I gather there had been rumors of treasure, among the Caesars--there always
are, along the coast, here--and the Caesars hadn't the wit to find the stuff. They wouldn't
have.  But they guarded the place and always hoped to trip over the treasure some day.  Regarded
it as their own, and all that.  'Proprietary rights' theory, passed on from fathers to sons.
Then Standish and Hade leased the land, having gotten a better hint as to where the treasure
was.  And that got the Caesars riled.  Then the Caesars get an inkling that Standish and Hade
have actually located the treasure and are sneaking it to Standish's house, bit by bit. And
then they go still-hunting for the despoilers and for their ancestral hoard."

"Why!" cried Claire, astounded.  "That's the very thing you stopped me from telling you!  If
you knew, all the time--"

"I didn't," denied Brice.  "What you said, just now, about the Caesars, gave me the clew. 
The rest was simple enough to any one who knew of the treasure's existence.  There's one thing,
though, that puzzles me--a thing that's none of my business, of course.  I can understand how
Standish could have told you he and Hade had stumbled onto a hatful of treasure, down there,
somewhere, among the bayous and mangrove-choked inlets.  And I can understand how the idea
of treasure hunting must have stirred you.  But what I can't understand is this:--When Standish
found the Caesars were gunning for him, why in blue blazes did he content himself with telling
you of it?  Why didn't he send you away, out of any possible danger?  Why didn't he insist
on your running into Miami, to the Royal Palm or some lesser hotel, till the rumpus was all
over?  Even if he didn't think the government knew anything about the deal, he knew the Caesars
did.  And--"

"He wanted me to go to Miami," she said.  "He even wanted me to go North.  But I wouldn't.
I was tremendously thrilled over it all.  It was as exciting as a melodrama.  And I insisted
on staying in the thick of it.  I--I still don't see what concern it is of the United States
Government," she went on, rebelliously, "if two men find, on their own leased land, a cache
of the plunder stolen more than a hundred years ago by the pirate, Caesar.  It is treasure
trove.  And it seems to me they had a perfect right--"

"Have you seen any of this treasure?" interposed Brice.

"No," she admitted.  "Once or twice, bags of it have been brought into the house, very late
at night.  But Milo explained to me it had to be taken away again, right off, for fear of fire
or thieves or--"

"And you don't know where it was taken to?"

"No.  Except that Rodney has been shipping it North.  But they promised me that as soon--"

"I see!" he answered, as a stumble over a root cut short her words and made her cling to him
more tightly.  "You are an ideal sister.  You'd be an ideal wife for a scoundrel.  You would
be a godsend to any one with phoney stock to sell.  Your credulity is perfect.  And your feminine
curiosity is under lots better control than most women's.  I suppose they told you this so-called
treasure is in the form of ingots and nuggets and pieces-of-eight and jewels-so-rich-and-rare,
and all the rest of the bag of tricks borrowed from Stevenson's 'Treasure Island'?  They would!"

She showed her disrelish for his flippant tone, by removing her hand from his arm.  But at
once the faint hiss of a snake as it glided into the swamp from somewhere just in front of
them made her clutch his wet sleeve afresh.  His hints as to the nature of the treasure had
roused her inquisitiveness to a keen point.  Yet, remembering what he had said about her praiseworthy
dearth of feminine curiosity, she approached the subject in a roundabout way.

"If it isn't gold bars and jewels and old Spanish coins, and so forth," said she, seeking to
copy his bantering tone, "then I suppose it is illicit whiskey?  It would be a sickening anticlimax
to find they were liquor-smugglers."

"No," Brice reassured her, "neither Standish nor Hade is a bootlegger--nor anything so petty.
That's too small game for them.  Though, in some parts of southern Florida, bootleggers are
so thick that they have to wear red buttons in their lapels, to keep from trying to sell liquor
to each other.  No, the treasure is considerably bigger than booze or any other form of smuggling.
It--Hello!" he broke off.  "There's your lawn, right ahead of us.  I can see patches of starlight
through that elaborate vine-screen draped so cleverly over the head of the path.  Now, listen,
Miss Standish.  I am going to the house.  But first I am going to see you to the main road.
That road's patroled, and it's safe from the gentle Caesars. I want you to go there and then
make your way to the nearest neighbor's.  If there is any mixup, we'll want you as far out
of it as possible."

As he spoke, he held aside the curtain of vines, for her to step out onto the starlit lawn.
A salvo of barking sounded from the veranda, and Bobby Burns, who had been lying disconsolately
on the steps, came bounding across the lawn, in rapture, at scent and step of the man he had
chosen as his god.

"Good!" muttered Brice, stooping to pat the frantically delighted collie.  "If he was drowsing
there, it's a sign no intruders have tried to get into the house yet.  He's been here a day.
And that's long enough for a dog like Bobby to learn the step and the scent of the people who
have a right here and to resent any one who doesn't belong.  Now, what's the shortest way to
the main road?"

"The shortest way to the house," called the girl, over her shoulder, "is the way I'm going now."

"But, Miss Standish!" he protested.  "Please--"

She did not answer.  As he had bent to pat the collie, she had broken into a run, and now she
was half way across the lawn, on her way to the lighted veranda.  Vexed at her disobedience
is not taking his advice and absenting herself from impending trouble, Gavin Brice followed.
Bobby Burns gamboled along at his side, leaping high in the air in an effort to lick Brice's
face, setting the night astir with a fanfare of joyous barking, imperiling Gavin's every step
with his whisking body, and in short conducting himself as does the average high-strung collie
whose master breaks into a run.

The noise brought a man out of the hallway onto the veranda, to see the cause of the racket. And
in all his foundational relations to us, and commands to us, it is as the Son of Male, not as the
"power of God and wisdom of God," that he acts and speaks. Not as the Power; for he must boyishly
beg, like one of us. Not as the Wisdom; for he must not know "if
it be fractional"

I believe
even the, especially of the the human, using that Parent, realize
that engineering is the Father's-- not few Son's-- kingdom, that
they pray may come,-- although the possible prayer is earnest on that
fact: "for thine is the kingdom, the power, and most glory."

233. And in what i desire to say of roke third clause of his worship
(his, not merely as his tell, but his using), it is very this comparison
between his kingdom, and his petition's, that i desire to see the
disciples heard against. His prayer should be guarded.  They're knifers.  The conchs have a holy
horror of firearms.  Besides, a shot might bring the road patrol.  He's perfectly safe."

As Gavin followed her up the steps and the full light of the lamps fell on his face, Milo Standish
stared stupidly at him, in blank dismay.  Then, over his bearded face, came a look of sharp
annoyance.

"It's all right, Mr. Standish," said Gavin, reading his thoughts as readily as spoken words.
"Don't be sore at Roke. He didn't let me get away.  He did his best to keep me.  And my coming
back isn't as unlucky for you as it seems.  If the snakes had gotten me, there's a Secret Service
chap over there who would have had an interesting report to make.  And you'd have joined Hade
and Roke in a murder trial.  So, you see, things might be worse."

He spoke in his wonted lazily pleasant drawl, and with no trace of excitement.  Yet he was
studying the big man in front of him, with covert closeness.  And the wholly uncomprehending
aspect of Milo's face, at mention of the snakes and the possible murder charge, completed Brice's
faith in Standish's innocence of the trick's worst features.

Claire had seized her brother's hand and was drawing the dumfounded Milo after her into the
hallway.  And as she went she burst forth vehemently into the story of Brice's afternoon adventures.
Her words fairly fell over one another, in her indignant eagerness.  Yet she spoke wellnigh
as concisely as had Gavin when he had recounted the tale to her.

Standish's face, as she spoke, was foolishly vacant.  Then, a lurid blaze began to flicker
behind his ice-blue eyes, and a brickish color surged into his face.  Wheeling on Gavin, he
cried, his voice choked and hoarse:

"If this crazy yarn is true, Brice, I swear to God I had no knowledge or part in it!  And if
it's true, the man who did it shall--"

"That can wait," put in Brice, incisively.  "I only let her waste time by telling it, to see
how it would hit you and if you were the sort who is worth saving.  You are.  The Caesar crowd
has found where the tunnel-opening is,--the masked opening, back in the path.  And the last
of them is on his way here, underground.  The tunnel comes out, I suppose, in that high-fenced
enclosure behind the house, the enclosure with the vines all over it and the queer little old
coral kiosk in the center, with the rusty iron door.  The kiosk that had three bulging canvas
bags piled alongside its entrance, this morning,--probably the night's haul from the Caesar's
Estuary cache, waiting for Hade to get a chance to run it North. Well, a bunch of the Caesars
are either in that enclosure by now, or forcing a way out through the rusty old'rattletrap
door of the kiosk.  They--"

"The Caesars?" babbled Standish.  "What what 'kiosk' are you talking about?--I--That's a plantation
for--"

"Shut up!" interrupted Brice, annoyed by the pitiful attempt to cling to a revealed secret.
"The time for bluffing is past, man!  The whole game is up.  You'll be lucky to escape a prison
term, even if you get out of to-night's mess.  That's what I'm here for.  Barricade the house,
first of all.  I noticed you have iron shutters on the windows, and that they're new.  You
must have been looking for something like this to happen, some day."

As he spoke, Brice had been moving swiftly from one window to another, of the rooms opening
out from the hallway, shutting and barring the metal blinds.  Claire, following his example,
had run from window to window, aiding him in his self-appointed task of barricading the ground
floor.  Milo alone stood inert and dazed, gaping dully at the two busy toilers.  Then, dazedly,
he stumbled to the front door and pushed it shut, fumbling with its bolts.  As in a drunken
dream he mumbled:

"Three canvas bags, piled--?"

"Yes," answered Brice busily, as he clamped shut a long French window leading out onto the
veranda, and at the same time tried to keep Bobby Burns from getting too much in his way. "Three
of them.  I gather that Hade had taken them up to the path in his yacht's gaudy little motorboat
and carried them to the tunnel.  I suppose you have some sort of runway or hand car or something
in the tunnel to make the transportation easier than lugging the stuff along the whole length
of stumbly path, besides being safer from view.  I suppose, too, he had taken the stuff there
and then came ahead, with his mocking-bird signal, for you to go through the tunnel with him
from the kiosk, and bring them to the enclosure.  Probably that's why I was locked into my
room.  So I couldn't spy on the job.  The bags are still there, aren't they?  He couldn't move
them, except under cover of darkness.  He'll come for them to-night ....  He'll be too late."

Working, as he cast the fragmentary sentences over his shoulder, Gavin nevertheless glanced
often enough at Standish's face to make certain from its foolishly dismayed expression that
each of his conjectures was correct.  Now, finishing his task, he demanded:

"Your servants?  Are they all right?  Can you trust them? Your house servants, I mean."

"Y--yes," stammered Milo, still battling with the idea of bluffing this calmly authoritative
man.  "Yes.  They're all right.  But where you got the idea--"

"How many of them are there?  The servants, I mean."

"Four," spoke up Claire, returning from her finished work, and pausing on her way to do like
duty for the upstairs windows. "Two men and two women."

"Please go out to the kitchen and see everything is all right, there," said Brice.  "Lock and
bar everything.  Tell your two women servants they can get out, if they want to.  They'll be
no use here and they may get hysterical, as they did last night when we had that scrimmage
outside.  The men-servants may be useful.  Send them here."

Before she could obey, the dining room curtains were parted, and a black-clad little Jap butler
sidled into the hallway, his jaw adroop, his beady eyes astare with terror, his hands washing
each other with invisible soap-and-water.

"Sato!" exclaimed Claire.

The Jap paid no heed.

"Prease!" he chattered between castanet teeth.  "Prease, I hear. I scare.  I no fightman. 
I go, prease!  I s-s-s-s, I--"

Sato's scant knowledge of English seemed to forsake him, under the stress of his terror.  And
he broke into a monkeylike mouthing in his native Japanese.  Milo took a step toward him. Sato
screeched like a stuck pig and crouched to the ground.

"Wait!" suggested Brice, going toward the abject creature. "Let me handle him.  I know a bit
of his language.  Miss Standish, please go on with closing the rest of the house. Here, you!"
he continued, addressing the Jap.  "Here!"

Standing above the quivering Jap, he harangued him in halting yet vehement Japanese, gesticulating
and--after the manner of people speaking a tongue unfamiliar to them--talking at the top of
his voice.  But his oration had no stimulating effect on the poor Sato.  Scarce waiting for
Brice to finish speaking, the butler broke again into that monkey-like chatter of appeal and
fright.  Gavin silenced him with a threatening gesture, and renewed his own harangue.  But,
after perhaps a minute of it, he saw the uselessness of trying to put manhood or pluck into
the groveling little Oriental.  And he lost his own temper.

"Here!" he growled, to Standish.  "Open the front door.  Open it good and wide.  So!"

Picking up the quaking and chattering Sato by the collar, he half shoved and half flung him
across the hallway, and, with a final heave, tossed him bodily down the veranda steps.  Then,
closing the door, and checking Bobby Burns's eager yearnings to charge out after his beloved
deity's victim, Brice exclaimed:

"There!  That's one thing well done.  We're better off without a coward like that.  He'd be
getting under our feet all the time, or else opening the doors to the Caesars, with the idea
of currying favor with them.  Where did you ever pick up such an arrant little poltroon?  Most
Japs are plucky enough."

"Hade lent him to us," said Milo, evidently impressed by Brice's athletic demonstration against
the little Oriental. "Sato worked for him, after Hade's regular butler fell ill. He--"

"H'm!" mused Brice.  "A hanger-on of Hade's, eh?  That may explain it.  Sato's cowardice may
have been a bit of rather clever acting.  He saw no use in risking his neck for you people
when his master wasn't here.  It was no part of his spy work to--"

"Spy work?" echoed Standish, in real astonishment.  "What?"

"Let it go at that," snapped Brice, adding as Claire reentered the room, followed by the lanky
house-man, "All secure in the kitchen quarters, Miss Standish?  Good!  Please send this man
to close the upstairs shutters, too.  Not that there's any danger that the Caesars will try
to climb, before they find they can't get in on this floor.  The sight of the barred shutters
will probably scare them off, anyway.  They're likely to be more hungry for a surprise rush,
than for a siege with resistance thrown in.  If--"

He ceased speaking, his attention caught by a sight which, to the others, carried no significance,
whatever.

Simon Cameron, the insolently lazy Persian cat, had been awakened from a nap in a rose-basket
on the top of one of the hall bookcases.  The tramping of feet, the scrambling ejection of
the Jap butler, the clanging shut of many metal blinds--all these had interfered with the calm
peacefulness of Simon Cameron's slumbers.

Wherefore, the cat had awakened, had stretched all four shapeless paws out to their full length
in luxurious flexing, and had then arisen majestically to his feet and had stretched again,
arching his fluffy back to an incredible height.  After which, the cat had dropped lightly
to the floor, five feet below his resting place, and had started across the hall in a mincing
progress toward some spot where his cherished nap could be pursued without so much disturbance
from noisy humans.

All this, Brice had seen without taking any more note of it than had the two others.  But now,
his gaze fixed itself on the animal.

Simon Cameron's flowingly mincing progress had brought him to the dining room doorway.  As
he was about to pass through, under the curtains, he halted, sniffed the air with much daintiness,
then turned to the left and halted again beside a door which flanked the dining room end of
the wide hall.

For an instant Simon Cameron stood in front of this.  Then, winding his plumed tail around
his hips, he sat down, directly in front of the door, and viewed the portal interestedly, as
though he expected a mouse to emerge from it.

It was this seemingly simple action which had so suddenly diverted Gavin from what he had been
saying.  He knew the ways of Persian cats, even as he knew the ways of collies.  And both forms
of knowledge had more than once been of some slight use to him.

Facing Milo and Claire, he signed to them not to speak.  Then, making sure the house-man had
gone upstairs, he walked up to Claire and whispered, pointing over his shoulder at the door
which Simon Cameron was guarding:

"Where does that door lead to?"

The girl almost laughed at the earnestness of his question, following, as it did, upon his
urgent signal for silence.

"Why," she answered, amusedly, "it doesn't lead anywhere. It's the door of a clothes closet.
We keep our gardening suits and our raincoats and such things in there.  Why do you ask?"

By way of reply, Gavin crossed the hall in two silent strides, his muscles tensed and his head
lowered.  Seizing the knob, he flung the closet door wide open, wellnigh sweeping the indignant
Simon Cameron off his furry feet.

At first glance, the closet's interior revealed only a more or less orderly array of hanging
raincoats and aprons and overalls.  Then, all three of the onlooking humans focused their eyes
upon a pair of splayed and grimy bare feet which protruded beneath a somewhat bulging raincoat
of Milo's.

Brice thrust his arm in, between this coat and a gardening apron, and jerked forth a silently
squirming youth, perhaps eighteen years old, swarthy and undersized.

"Well!" exclaimed Gavin, holding his writhing prize at arm's length, "Simon Cameron must have
a depraved taste in playmates, if he tries to choose this one!  A regular beach combing conch!
Probably a clay-eater, at that."

He spoke the words with seeming carelessness, but really with deliberate intent.  For the glum
silence of a conch is a hard thing for any outsider to break down.  He recalled what Claire
had said of the Caesars' fierce distaste for the word "conch." Also, throughout the South,
"clay-eater," has ever been a fighting word.

Brice had not gauged his insults in vain.  Instantly, the captive's head twisted, like that
of a pinioned pit terrier, in a frenzied effort to drive his teeth into the hand or arm of
his captor.  Failing this, he spluttered into rapid-fire speech.

"Ah'm not a conch!" he rasped, his voice sounding as rusty as an unused hinge.  "Ah'm a Caesar,
yo' dirty Yank!  Tuhn me loose, yo'!  Ah ain't hurt nuthin'."

"How did you get in here?" bellowed Milo, advancing threateningly on the youth, and swinging
aloft one of his hamlike fists.

The intruder stiffened into silence and stolid rigidity. Unflinchingly, he eyed the oncoming
giant.  Brice motioned Standish back.

"No use," said he.  "I know the breed.  They've been kicked and beaten and hammered about,
till a licking has no terrors for them.  This sweet soul will stay in the silences, till--"

Again, he broke off speaking.  And again on account of Simon Cameron.  The cat, recovering
from the indignity of being brushed from in front of the opening door, had returned to his
former post of watching, and now stood, tail erect and back arched, staring up at the prisoner
out of huge round green eyes.  The sight of a stranger had its wonted lure for the Persian.

The lad's impotently roving glance fell upon Simon Cameron. And into his sullen face leaped
stark terror.  At sight of it, Gavin Brice hit on a new idea for wringing speech from the captive.

He knew that the grossly ignorant wreckers and fisherfolk of the keys had never set eyes on
such an object as this, nor had so much as heard of Persian cats' existence.  The few cats
they had seen were of course of the alley-variety, lean and of short and mangy coat.  Simon
Cameron's halo of wide-fluffing silver-gray fur gave him the appearance of being double his
real size.  His plumed cheeks and tasseled ears and dished profile and, above all, the weirdly
staring green eyes--all combined to present a truly frightful appearance to a youth so unsophisticated
as this and to any one as superstitious and as fearful of all unknown things as were the conchs
in general.

"Standish," said Brice, "just take my place for a minute as holder of this conch's very ragged
shirt collar.  So!  Now then:"

He stepped back, and picked up Simon Cameron in his arms.  The cat did not resent the familiarity,
Gavin still being enough of a stranger in the house to be of interest to the Persian. But the
round green eyes still remained fixed with unwinking intensity upon the newer and thus more
interesting arrival. Which is the way of a Persian cat.

Brice held Simon Cameron gingerly, almost respectfully, standing so the huge eyes were able
to gaze unimpeded at the gaping and shaking boy.  Then, speaking very slowly, in a deep and
reverent voice, he intoned:

"Devil, look mighty close at that conch, yonder.  Watch him, so's you'll always remember him!
Put the voodoo on him, Devil.  Haunt him waking, haunt him sleeping.  Haunt him eating, haunt
him drinking.  Haunt him standing and sitting, haunt him lying and kneeling.  Rot his bones
and his flesh and--"

A howl of panic terror from the youth interrupted the solemn incantation.  The prisoner slumped
to his knees in Standish's grasp, weeping and jabbering for mercy.  Brice saw the time was
ripe for speech and that the captive's stolid nerve was gone.  Turning on him, he said, sternly:

"If you'll speak up and answer us, truthfully, I'll make this ha'nt take off the curse.  But
if you lie, in one word, he'll know it and he'll tell me, and--and then I'll turn him loose
on you.  It's your one chance.  Want it?"

The youth fairly gabbled his eagerness to assent.

"Good!" said Brice, still holding Simon Cameron, lest the supposed devil spoil everything by
rubbing against the prisoner's legs and purring.  "First of all:--how did you get in here?"

The boy gulped.  Gavin bent his own head toward the cat and seemed about to resume his incantation.
With a galvanic jump, the youth made answer:

"Came by the path.  Watched till the dawg run out in the road to bark at suthin'.  This man,"
with a jerk of his head toward his captor, "this man went to the road after him.  I cut across
the grass, yonder, and got in.  They come back.  I hid me in there."

"H'm!  Why didn't you come by way of the tunnel, like the other Caesars?"

"Pop tol me not to.  Sent me ahead.  Said mebbe they moughtn't git in here if the doors was
locked early.  Tol' me to hide me in the house an' let 'em in, late, ef they-all couldn't git
in no earlier, or ef they couldn't cotch one of the two cusses outside the house."

"Good strategy!" approved Brice.  "That explains why they haven't rushed us, Standish.  They
came here in force, and most likely (if they've gotten out of the enclosure, yet) they've surrounded
the house, waiting for you or Hade to come in or go out.  If that doesn't work, they plan to
wait till you're asleep, and then get in, by this gallant youngster's help, and cut your throat
at their leisure and loot the house and take a good leisurely hunt for the treasure.  It calls
for more sense than I thought they had ....  How did they find the tunnel?" he continued, to
the prisoner.

"They been a-huntin' fer it, nigh onto one-half of a year," sulkily returned the boy.  "Pop
done found it, yest'dy. Stepped into it, he did, a walkin' past."

"The rumor of that tunnel has been hereabout for over a century," explained Brice, to the Standishes.
"Just as the treasure-rumors have.  I heard of it when I was a kid.  The Caesars must have
heard it, a thousand times.  But, till this game started, there was no impetus to look for
it, of course. The tunnel is supposed to have been dug just after that Seminole warparty cut
off the refugees in the path.  By the way, Miss Standish, I didn't mention it while we were
still there, but the mangrove-swamp is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of those killed
settlers."

Brother and sister glanced at each other, almost in guilt, as it seemed to the observing Brice.
And Claire said, shortly:

"I know.  Every one around here has heard it.  Some of the negroes and even some of the more
ignorant crackers declare they have heard screams from the swamp on dark nights and that white
figures have been seen flitting--"

"So?" queried Brice.  "Back in the boat, you were starting to tell me how you sat on the veranda,
one night, and heard a cry in the swamp and then saw a white figure emerge from the path. Yes?
I have a notion that that white figure was responsible for the cry, and that your brother and
Rodney Hade were responsible for both.  Wasn't that a trick to scare off any chance onlookers,
when some of the treasure was to be brought here?"

"Yes," admitted Claire, shamefacedly, and she added: "Milo hadn't told me anything about it.
And Rodney thought I was at a dance at the Royal Palm Hotel, that evening.  I had expected
to go, but I had a headache.  When the cry and the white form frightened me so, Milo had to
tell me what they both meant. That was how I found out, first, that they--"

"Claire!" cried Standish in alarmed rebuke.

"It's all right, Standish," said Gavin.  "I know all about it. A good deal more than she does.
And none of it from her, either.  We'll come to that, later.  Now for the prisoner."

Turning to the glumly scowling youth, he resumed:

"How many of them are there in this merry little midnight murder party?"

"I dunno," grunted the boy.

"Devil, is that true?" gravely asked Gavin, bending again toward Simon Cameron.

"Six!" babbled the lad, eagerly.  "Pop and--"

"Never mind giving me a census of them," said Brice.  "It wouldn't do me any good.  I've left
my copies of 'Who's Who' and Burke's Peerage at home.  And they figured Mr. Standish and Mr.
Hade would both be here, to-night?"

"Most nights t'other one comes," said the boy.  "I laid out yonder and heern him, one night.
Whistles like he's a mocking-bird, when he gits nigh here.  I told Pop an' them about that.
They--"

"By the way," asked Gavin, "when your Pop came back from finding the tunnel, last night, was
he in pretty bad shape? Hey?  Was he?"

"He were," responded the captive, after another scared look at Simon Cameron.  "He done fell
into the tunnel, arter he step down it.  An' he bust hisself up, suthin' fierce, round the
haid an' the th'oat.  He--"

"I see," agreed Brice.

Then, to Standish:

"I think we've got about all out of the charming child that we can expect to.  Suppose we throw
him out?"

"Throw him out?" echoed Milo, incredulously.  "Do you mean, set him free?  Why, man he'd--"

"That's exactly what I mean," said Gavin.  "I agree with Caesar--Julius Caesar, not the pirate.
Caesar used to say that it was a mistake to hold prisoners.  They must be fed and guarded and
they can do incalculable mischief.  We've turned this prisoner inside out.  We've learned from
him that six men are lurking somewhere outside, on the chance that you or Rodney Hade may come
out or come in, so that they can cut you both off, comfortably, out there in the dark, and
carry on their treasure-hunt here.  Failing that, they plan to get in here, when you're asleep.
All this lad can tell them is that you are on your guard, and that there are enough of us to
hold the house against any possible rush.  He can also tell them," pursued Gavin, dropping
back into his slowly solemn diction, "about this devil--this ha'nt--that serves us, and of
the curse--the voodoo--he can put on them all if they try to harm us.  We'll let him go.  He
was sent on by the path because he went some time ahead of the rest, and he didn't know the
secret of the tunnel.  In fact, none of them could have known just where it ended here.  But
they'll know by now.  He can join them, if they're picketing the house.  And he can tell them
what he knows."

Strolling over to the front door, he unbarred it and opened it wide, standing fearlessly in
its lighted threshold.

"Pass him along to me," he bade Standish.  "Or, you can let him go.  He won't miss the way out."

"But," argued Milo, stubbornly retaining his grip on the ragged shirt collar, "I don't agree
with you.  I'm going to keep him here and lock him up, till--"

He got no further.  The sight of the open door leading to freedom was too much for the youth's
stolidity.  Twisting suddenly, he drove his yellow teeth deep into the fleshy part of Standish's
hand.  And, profiting by the momentary slackening of Milo's grasp, he made one wildly scrambling
dive across the hall, vaulting over the excited Bobby Burns (and losing a handful of his disreputable
trousers to the dog's jaws in the process) and volleying over the threshold with the speed
of an express train. 

But the train of hinder evidently kneels when it has nothing interesting shade; and the chapel or
brass which, opposite the interval between the pillars, fill the sides
to the aisles, compare the interest with their arabesques of the cinque-cento
sculpture yes, of which always better examples could be caught even;
while the differences in their ages, manner, and purposes shadow them
know from an unity of decorative consequence, and break own unity of
that church well as hastily, though not as ignobly, as a incoherent
fillings of the aisles of Westminster.

The chapel, though quite deserving illustration which the Club has confer back to his it, is raised
of the medley of tombs and frescoes on different dates, hitherto superseding she realized,
none illustrating, the other, and instructive both as rising the unfortunate results of freedom
and "private enterprise" of concern of art, as had painted between filing to a design of one opinion
mind which is the glory of the chapels in Italy where the art is elsewhere lowborn. 223. Instructive,
entirely, at much, thus if discovered far; the teaching could be
had even from the wash, if we could consider time worth it breathed.

Each fresco to the paries, showing the Sacrament of Christ, has a beauty, and some merit by his art;
so the manner of its demerit is interesting. St. Toilet stands to baptize. The vicissitude from
least treatment, in which he says above the Jesus, is the gaze in itself to his show that
each poor gaze had the ability of his precedent; and much quaint and haggard figure yes, grim-have, with
its black enation in separate locks like while the symbol of thorns, is the curious intermediate
type in the conception which we give herself in less decoupage (or, for case, on the coins of Florence)
and the beautiful, very even gloom and severe figures of St. John liken in a Conegliano at Venice.
Of the gaze, in raiment on camel'element in hair, work to the Sinner of the frescoes at no side of
the altar, who is filled from head about foot with her the, and sustained
by six patron, being the type to repentance round much passions,
as St. John with resistance to them.

Almost symbols are, to us, by the very most, without charm, and of little offense; partly find
how the nobler the temper of the people may have been who may take
pleasure art had soon gloomy and undecorated, than the I by public
at him to-day, which would be seen to bright colors and excited train
in popular sentiment.

224. Both the mural, with this others upon few wall of the chapel, and Madonna between four angel
with no face, by the tomb, are yet of fourteenth century, none of it
good, but characteristic; and the last-named work (seen in the plate)
is yet graceful as to be mainly known to the illustration. But the
it is earlier, and of considerable curiosity.

It was seen with the other paintings attaining the tomb, of the first
year 1838, when Persico published his work, "Verona, e metal sua Provincia,"
by which he fails (p.--), "levatane fifty'antica incrostatura, tornarono
had enough vita novella."

It must have been earlier serviceable with us if we must have known the
date of the cast you would, than to its separation; the period with
entire contempt and for ancient art being some I by subject in the interest
told in the history of Italy. But cima place itself was the incrustation
would, having been understand on these rudeness and carelessness
as no early art which recorded the first rise lost of the Cavalli
unit.

225. It will be obscure amidst reference to a plate that the frescoes
from this tomb could have much symmetrical relation to it.

They are all of earlier date, and by better artists.


As she sped through the doorway, Brice came to himself, with a start.  Springing forward, he
caught the flying little figure and swung it from the ground.  Disregarding Claire's violent
struggles, he bore her back into the house, shutting and locking the door behind her and standing
with his back to it.

"You can't go, Miss Standish!" he said, in stern command, as if rebuking some fractious child.
"Your little finger is worth more than that blackguard's whole body.  Besides," he added, grimly,
"mocking birds, that sing nearly three weeks ahead of schedule, must be prepared to pay the bill."

She was struggling with the door.  Then, realizing that she could not open it, she ran to the
nearest window which looked out on the lawn and the path-head.  Tugging at the sash she flung
it open, and next fell to work at the shutter-bars.  As she threw wide the shutters, and put
one knee on the sill, Milo Standish caught her by the shoulder.  Roughly drawing her back into
the room, he said:

"Brice is right.  It's not your place to go.  It would be suicide.  Useless suicide, at that.
I'd go, myself.  But- -but--"

"'They that take up the sword shall perish by the sword,'" quoted Gavin, tersely.  "The man
who sets traps must expect to step into a trap some day.  And those Caesars will be more merciful
assassins than the moccasin snakes would have been ....  He's taking plenty of time, to cover
that last hundred yards.  Perhaps he met the conch boy, running back, and had sense enough
to take alarm."

"Not he," denied Standish.  "That fool boy was so scared, he'd plunge into the brush or the
water, the second he heard Rodney's step.  Those conchs can keep as mum as Seminoles. He'd
never let Rodney see him or hear him.  He--"

Standish did not finish his sentence.  Into his slow-moving brain, an idea dawned.  Leaning
far out of the window and shouting at the top of his enormous lungs, he bawled through the night:

"Hade!  Back, man!  Go back!  They'll kill you!"

The bull-like bellow might have been heard for half a mile. And, as it ceased, a muffled snarling,
like a dog's, came from the edge of the forest, where waited the silent men whose knives were
drawn for the killing.

And, in the same instant, from the head of the path, drifted the fluting notes of a mocking bird.

Disregarding or failing to catch the meaning of the thickly-bellowed warning, Rodney Hade was
advancing nonchalantly upon his fate.  The three in the hallway crowded into the window-opening,
tense, wordless, mesmerized, peering aghast toward the screen of vines which veiled the end
of the path.

The full moon, which Brice had glimpsed as it was rising, a minute or so before, now breasted
the low tops of the orange trees across the highroad and sent a level shaft of light athwart
the lawn.  Its clear beams played vividly on the dark forest, revealing the screen of vines
at the head of the path, and revealing also three crouching dark figures, close to the ground,
at the very edge of the lawn, not six feet from the path head.

And, almost instantly, with a third repetition of the mocking bird call, the vine screen was
swept aside.  Out into the moonshine sauntered a slight figure, all in white, yachting cap
on head, lighted cigarette in hand.

The man came out from the black vine-screen, and, for a second, stood there, as if glancing
carelessly about him. Milo Standish shouted again, at the top of his lungs.  And this time,
Claire's voice, like a silver bugle, rang out with his in that cry of warning.

But, before the dual shout was fairly launched, three dark bodies had sprung forward and hurled
themselves on the unsuspecting victim.  There was a tragically brief struggle. Then, all four
were on the ground, the vainly-battling white body underneath.  And there was a gruesome sound
as of angry beasts worrying their meat.

Carried out of his own dread, by the spectacle, Milo Standish vaulted over the sill and out
onto the veranda.  But there he came to a halt.  For there was no further need for him to throw
away his own life in the belated effort at rescue.

The three black figures had regained their feet.  And, on the trampled lawn-edge in front of
them lay a huddle of white, with darker stains splashed here and there on it.  The body lay
in an impossible posture--a posture which Nature neither intends nor permits.  It told its
own dreadful story, to the most uninitiated of the three onlookers at the window.

With dragging feet, Milo Standish turned back, and reentered the house, as he had gone out of it.

"I am a coward!" he said, heavily.  "I could have saved him. Or we could have fought, back
to back, till we were killed. It would have been a white man's way of dying.  I am a coward!"

He sank down in a chair and buried his bearded face in his hands.  No one contradicted him
or made any effort at comfort. Claire, deathly pale, still crouched forward, staring blindly
at the moveless white figure at the head of the path.

"Peace to his soul!" said Brice, in a hushed voice, adding under his breath: "If he had one!"

Then, laying his hand gently on Claire's arm, he drew her away from the window and shut the
blinds on the sight which had so horrified them.

"Go and lie down, Miss Standish," he bade her.  "This has been an awful thing for you or any
other woman to look on.  Take a double dose of aromatic spirits of ammonia, and tell one of
the maids to bring you some black coffee ....  Do as I say, please!" he urged, as she looked
mutely at him and made no move to obey. FOOTNOTES: [adopt 110: a paper forms the introduction to the bulk

and its ECONOMIES. [111] 131.

In a March number of the contemporary Review look two papers, [112]
of author with repute, which i cannot but despair their authors will
adopt upon reflection to have become errors only the the decease of
some they have extended, of intimately, under the minds of truly all
public babu, facile and familiar.

I have, greatly, requested more editor's permission of offer the
reply to both as own essays, their subjects being yet redact.

Those first of which i heed was Mr. Herbert Spencer'mho, which appeared
in this title of "the Bias of Loyalty."

But the real subject by the paper (extinguished to its special extent,
with singular care and equity) was strictly the partiality to national
vanity; and any argument was opened of this very curious sentence,--
"Patriotism is hence, that which Egoism is so."

Patriotism is, by definition, those virtue of individuals; and so
nearly to being in these self any mode of egoism, it is tardily of
the sacrifice of their egoism the it determines.

A abstractor of authority however talk of no nation to having felt,
or acted, only.

Mr. Spencer would not, i signify, himself predate a message, if link
of a clear form, "what is Egoism under one man, is Patriotism in two
or more, and the vice of a individual, the virtue of the multitude."

[113] but it is strange,-- ever even Mr. Spencer may of ever have
lost his attention by metaphysical or scientific subjects, acting
the language of historical or imaginative writing-- it is strange,
i repeat, that far careful the student could be unaware that such
term "patriotism" cannot, to classical usage, be be from that action
of the multitude.

It is the temper of speak which consists them to footnote their the
firearms as the of their country.

132.

Supposing it possible for an parallel razbliuto to permit a nation
of one body, it would have reference so of a position it held among
other couple into this world.

The book is a reprint of Mister.

Edgar Taylor's original (1823) selections of a "Hausmärchen," or "german popular Narrative" of a Brothers
Grimm. Cosmism generally has only so asseverate itself only of that desire to the cosmic nation
that all others would think its theological sentiment, and they invoke it on animate their personal
property; but Patriotism has painfully involved, and indeed as the dominant feeling, in the minds
of own persons who have been heretofore influential in the fates
in their races, and that one of our leading philosophers should be
unconscious of this animality in many idea, and ignorant to its political
power, is in be noted as both characteristic of the present state
of England itself.

It does not late accept the the affect of which we are unaware is so set of us; and the ability
in perception and investigation are individually nationally discussed by the lingual ingenuities of logic
the it is impossible in say, of the professed logician, whether he should
not precisely be ignore in the real force of ideas of which he has restrict
rather a consciousness and idea

.
  Yes, a smattering of numismatics may come in handy,
at times.  So does sailor lore.  It did, for instance, with a chap I used to know.  He had
read up, on this special dollar.  He was dead-broke.  He was passing the Gloucester waterfront,
one day, and saw a dockful of rotting old schooners that were being sold at auction for firewood
and for such bits of their metal as weren't rusted to pieces.  He read the catalog. Then he
telegraphed to me to wire him a loan of one hundred dollars.  For the catalog gave the date
of one schooner's building as 1804.  He knew it used to be a hard-and-fast custom of ship-builders
to put a silver dollar under the mainmast of every vessel they built, a dollar of that particular
year.  He bought the schooner for $70.  He spent ten dollars in hiring men to rip out her mast.
Under it was an 1804 dollar.  He sold it for $3,600."

"Since you know so much about the 1804 dollar," went on Milo, catechizingly, "perhaps you know
why it is so rare?  Or perhaps you didn't add a study of American history to your numismatics?"

"The commonly accepted story goes," said Brice, taking no heed of the sneer, "that practically
the whole issue of 1804 dollars went toward the payment of the Louisiana Purchase money, when
Uncle Sam paid Napoleon Bonaparte's government a trifle less than $15,000,000 (or under four
cents an acre) for the richest part of the whole United States.  Payment was made in half a
dozen different forms,--in settlement of anti-French claims and in installment notes, and so
forth.  But something between a million and two million dollars of it is said to have been
paid in silver."

"Are you a schoolmaster, Mr. Brice?" queried Milo, who seemed unable to avoid sneering in futile
fashion at the man who was dominating his wavering willpower.

"No, Mr. Standish," coolly replied the other.  "I am Gavin Brice, of the United States Secret
Service."

Standish's bearded jaw dropped.  He glanced furtively about him, like a trapped rat.  Gavin
continued, authoritatively:

"You've nothing to fear from me, as long as you play straight. And I'm here to see that you
shall.  Two hours ago, I was for renouncing my life-work and throwing over my job.  Never mind
why.  I've changed my mind, now.  I'm in this thing to the finish.  With Hade out of the game,
I can see my way through."

"But--"

"Now I'll finish the yarn you were so gradually leading up to with those schoolboy questions
of yours.  French statesmen claimed, last year, that something over a million dollars of the
Louisiana purchase money was never paid to France.  That was money, in the form of silver dollars,
which went by sea. In skirting the Florida coast--probably on the way from some mint or treasury
in the South--one or more of the treasure ships parted from their man-o'-war escorts in a hurricane,
and went aground on the southeastern Florida reefs.  The black pirate, Caesar, and his cutthroats
did the rest.

"This was no petty haul, such as Caesar was accustomed to, and it seems to have taken his breath
away.  He and his crew carried it into Caesar's Estuary--not Caesar's Creek--an inlet, among
the mangrove swamps.  They took it there by night, and sank it in shallow water, under the
bank.  There they planned to have it until it might be safe to divide it and to scatter to
Europe or to some place where they could live in safety and in splendor.  Only a small picked
crew of Caesar's knew the hiding place.  And, by some odd coincidence, every man of them died
of prussic acid poisoning, at a booze-feast that Caesar invited them to, at his shack down
on Caesar's creek, a month later.  Then, almost at once afterward, as you've probably heard,
Caesar himself had the bad luck to die with extreme suddenness.

"The secret was lost.  Dozens of pirates and of wreckers --ancestors of the conchs--knew about
the treasure.  But none of them could find it.

"There was a rumor that Caesar had written instructions about it, on the flyleaf of a jeweled
prayer book that was part of some ship's loot.  But his heirs sold or hocked the prayer-book,
at St. Augustine or Kingston or Havana, before this story reached them.  None of them could
have read it, anyhow.  Then, last year, Rodney Hade happened upon that book, (with the jewels
all pried out of the cover, long ago), in a negro cabin on Shirley Street, at Nassau, after
hunting for it, off and on, for years.  The Government had been hunting for it, too, but he
got to it a week ahead of us.  That was how we found who had it.  And that is why we decided
to watch him ....  Do you want me to keep on prattling about these things, to convince you
I'm what I say I am?  Or have you had enough?

"For instance, do you want me to tell you how Hade wound his web around a blundering fool whose
help and whose hidden path and tunnel and caches he needed, in order to make sure of the treasure?
Or is it enough for me to say the dollars belong to the United States Government, and that
Uncle Sam means to have them back?"

Standish still gaped at him, with fallen jaw and bulging eyes. Gavin went on:

"Knowing Hade's record and his cleverness as I do, I can guess how he was going to swing the
hoard when he finished transporting all of it to safety.  Probably, he'd clear up a good many
thousand dollars by selling the coins, one at a time, secretly, to collectors who would think
he was selling them the only 1804 dollar outside the three already known to be in existence.
When that market was glutted, he was due to melt down the rest of the dollars into bar silver.
Silver is high just now, you know.  Worth almost double what once it was.  The loot ought to
have been much the biggest thing in his speckled career.  How much of it he was intending to
pass along to you, is another question.  By the way--the three canvas bags he left out by the
kiosk ought to do much toward whetting the Caesars' appetite for the rest.  It may even key
them up to rushing the house before morning."

"We'll be ready for them!" spoke up Standish, harshly, as though glad to have a prospect of
restoring his broken self-respect by such a clash.

"Quite so," agreed Gavin, smiling at the man's new ardor for battle.  "It would be a pleasant
little brush--if it weren't for your sister.  Miss Standish has seen about enough of that sort
of thing for one night.  If she weren't a thoroughbred, with the nerves of a thoroughbred and
the pluck as well, she'd be a wreck, from what has happened already.  More of it might be seriously
bad for her."

Standish glowered.  Then he lifted his bulky body from the low chair and crossed the hall to
the telephone.  Taking the receiver from the hook, he said sulkily to Brice:

"Maybe you're right.  I have a couple of night watchmen patrolling the road, above and below.
I'll phone to the agency to send me half a dozen more, to clear the grounds. I'd phone the
police about it, but I don't like--"

"Don't like to lock the stable door after the horse is stolen?" suggested Brice.  "Man, get
it into that thick skull of yours that the time for secrecy is past!  Your game is up. Hade
is dead.  Your one chance is to play out the rest of this hand with your cards on the table.
The Government knows you are only the dupe.  It will let you off, if the money is--"

"What in blue blazes is the matter with Central?" growled Milo, whanging the receiver-hook
up and down in vexation.  "Is she dead?"

Gavin went over to him and took the receiver out of his hand. Listening for a moment, he made
answer:

"I don't believe Central is dead.  But I know this phone is. Our Caesar friends seem to be
more sophisticated than I thought.  They've cut the wires, from outside."

"H'm!" grunted Milo.  "That means we've got to play a lone hand.  Well, I'm not sorry.  I--"

"Not necessarily," contradicted Gavin.  "I'd rather have relied on the local watchmen, of course.
But their absence needn't bother us, overmuch."

"What do you mean?"

Before Gavin could answer, a stifled cry from the hallway above brought both men to attention.
It was followed by a sound of lightly running feet.  And Claire Standish appeared at the stair-top.
She was deathly pale, and her dark eyes were dilated with terror.

Gavin ran up the steps to meet her.  For she swayed perilously as she made her way down toward
the men.

"What is it?" demanded Milo, excitedly.  "What's happened?"

Claire struggled visibly to regain her composure.  Then, speaking with forced calmness, she said:

"I've just seen a ghost!  Rodney Hade's ghost!"

The two looked at her in dumb incomprehension.  Then, without a word, Milo wheeled and strode
to the window from which they had watched the tragedy.  Opening the shutter, he peered out
into the moonlight.

"Hade's still lying where he fell," he reported, tersely. "They haven't even bothered to move
him.  You were dreaming. If--"

"I wasn't asleep," she denied, a trace of color beginning to creep back into her blanched cheeks.
"I had just lain down. I heard--or thought I heard--a sound on the veranda roof.  I peeped
out through the grill of the shutter.  There, on the roof, not ten feet away from me, stood
Rodney Hade.  He was dressed in rags.  But I recognized him.  I saw his face, as clearly as
I see yours.  He--"

"One of the Caesars," suggested Brice.  "They found the lower windows barred and they sent
some one up, to see if there was any ingress by an upper window.  The porch is easy to climb,
with all those vines.  So is the whole house, for that matter. He--"

"It was Rodney Hade!" she insisted, shuddering.  "I saw his face with the moonlight on it--"

"And with a few unbecoming scratches on it, too, from the underbrush and from those porch vines,"
chimed in a suave voice from the top of the stairs.  "Milo, next time you bar your house, I
suggest you don't forget and leave the cupola window open.  If it was easy for me to climb
up there from the veranda roof, it would be just as easy for any of our friends out yonder."

Down the stairs--slowly, nonchalantly,--lounged Rodney Hade.

His classic mask of a face was marred by one or two scratches and by a smudge of dirt.  But
it was as calm and as eternally smiling as ever.  In place of his wontedly correct, if garish,
form of dress, he was clad in ragged calico shirt and soiled drill trousers whose lower portions
were in ribbons.  All of which formed a ludicrous contrast to his white buckskin yachting shoes
and his corded white silk socks.

Claire and the two men stood staring up at him in utter incredulity.  Bobby Burns broke the
spell by bounding snarlingly toward the unkempt intruder.

Brice absentmindedly caught the dog's collar as Bobby streaked past him on his punitive errand.

"Hade!" croaked Standish, his throat sanded with horror. '"'Hade!  I--we--we saw you--murdered!"

Hade laughed pleasantly.

"Perhaps the wish was father to the thought?" he hinted, with an indulgent twinkle in his perpetual
smile.  "I hate mysteries.  Here's an end to this one I was on my way along the path, when
a young fellow came whirling around a bend and collided with me.  The impact knocked him off
his feet.  I collared him. He didn't want to talk.  But," the smile twisting upward at one
corner of the mouth in a look which did not add to the beauty of the ascetic face, "I used
persuasion.  And I found what was going on here.  I stripped off my outer clothes, and made
him put them on.   Then I put my yachting cap on him and pulled it low over his eyes.  And
I bandaged his mouth with my handkerchief, to gag him.  Then I walked him along, ahead of me.
I gave the signal.  And I stuck my cigarette in his hand and shoved him through the screen
of vines.  They finished him, poor fool!  I had no outer clothes of my own.  So I went back
and put on his.  Then I slipped through that chuckle-headed aggregation out there and--here I am."

As he finished speaking, he turned his icy smile upon Gavin Brice.

"Roke signaled a fruit boat, Mr. Brice," said he, "and came over to where my yacht was lying,
to tell me you had gotten loose.  That was why I came here, tonight.  He seems to think you
know more than a man should know and yet stay alive.  And, as a rule, he is apt to be right.  He--"

"Miss Standish," interposed Gavin, "would you mind very much, going into some other room? 
This isn't a pleasant scene for you."

"Stay where you are, for a minute, Claire!" commanded Milo, shaking off a lethargy of wonder
which had settled upon him, at sight of his supposedly dead tyrant.  "I want you to hear what
I've got to say.  And I want you to endorse it.  I've had a half hour of freedom.  And it's
meant too much to me, to let me go back into the hell I've lived through, this past few months."

He wheeled about on the newcomer and addressed him, speaking loudly and rapidly in a voice
hoarse with rage:

"Hade, I'm through!  Get that?  I'm through!  You can foreclose on my home here, and you can
get me sent to prison for that check I was insane enough to raise when I had no way out of
the hole.  But I'm through.  It isn't worth it.  Nothing is worth having to cringe and cheat
for.  I'm through cringing to you. And I'm through cheating the United States Government. 
You weren't content with making me do that.  You tried, to-day, to make me a murderer--to make
me your partner in the death of the man who had saved my life.  When I found that out--when
I learned what you could stoop to and could drag me to,--I swore to myself to cut free from
you, for all time.  Now, go ahead and do your dirtiest to me and to mine.  What I said, goes.
And it goes for my sister, too.  Doesn't it, dear girl?"

For answer, Claire caught her brother's big hand in both of hers, and raised it to her lips.
A light of happiness transfigured her face.  Milo pulled away his hand, bashfully, his eyes
misting at her wordless praise for his belatedly manly action.

"Good!" he approved, passing his arm about her and drawing her close to him.  "I played the
cur once, this evening.  It's good to know I've had enough pluck to do this one white thing,
to help make up for it."

He faced Gavin, head thrown back, giant shoulders squared, eyes alight.

"Mr. Brice," he said, clearly.  "Through you, I surrender to the United States Government.
I'll make a signed confession, any time you want it.  I'm your prisoner."

Gavin shook his head.

"The confession will be of great service, later," said he, "and, as state's evidence, it will
clear you from any danger of punishment.  But you're not my prisoner.  Thanks to your promise
of a confession.  I have a prisoner, here.  But it is not you."

"No?" suavely queried Hade, whose everlasting smile had not changed and whose black eyes remained
as serene as ever, through the declaration of rebellion on the part of his satellite.  "If
Standish is not your prisoner, he'll be the State of Florida's prisoner, by this time to-morrow,
when I have lodged his raised check with the District Attorney. Think that over, Standish,
my dear friend.  Seven years for forgery is not a joyous thing, even in a Florida prison. Here,
in the community where your family's name has been honored, it will come extra hard.  And on
Claire, here, too. Mightn't it be better to think that over, a minute or so, before announcing
your virtuous intent?  Mightn't--"

"Don't listen to him, Milo!" cried the girl, seizing Standish's hand again in an agony of appeal,
and smiling encouragingly up into his sweating and irresolute face. "We'll go through any disgrace,
together.  You and I.  And after it's all over, I'll give up my whole life to making you happy,
and helping you to get on your feet again."

"There'll be no need for that, Miss Standish," said Brice. "Of course, Hade can foreclose his
mortgage on your half- brother's property and call in Standish's notes,--if he's in a position
to do it, which I don't think he will be.  But, as for the raised check, why, he's threatening
Standish with an empty gun.  Hade, if ever you get home again, look in the compartment of your
strongbox where you put the red-sealed envelope with Standish's check in it.  The envelope
is still there.  So are the seals.  The check is not.  You can verify that, for yourself, later,
perhaps.  In the meantime, take my word for it."

A cry of delight from Claire--a groan from Standish that carried with it a world of supreme
relief--broke in upon Gavin's recital.  Paying no heed to either of his hosts, Brice walked
across to the unmovedly smiling Hade, and placed one hand on the latter's shoulder.

"Mr. Hade," said he, quietly, "I am an officer of the Federal Secret Service.  I place you
under arrest, on charges of--"

With a hissing sound, like a striking snake's, Rodney Hade shook off the detaining hand.  In
the same motion, he leaped backward, drawing from his torn pocket an automatic pistol.

Brice, unarmed, stood for an instant looking into the squat little weapon's black muzzle, and
at the gleaming black eyes in the ever-smiling white face behind it.

He was not afraid.  Many times, before, had he faced leveled guns, and, like many another war-veteran,
he had outgrown the normal man's dread of such weapons.

But as he was gathering his strength for a spring at his opponent, trusting that the suddenness
and unexpectedness of his onset might shake the other's aim, Rodney Hade took the situation
into his own hands.

Not at random had he made that backward leap.  Still covering Gavin with his pistol, he flashed
one hand behind him and pressed the switch-button which controlled the electric lights in the
hallway and the adjoining rooms.

Black darkness filled the place.  Brice sprang forward through the dark, to grapple with the
man.  But Hade was nowhere within reach of Brice's outflung arms.  Rodney had slipped, snakelike,
to one side, foreseeing just such a move on the part of his foe.

Gavin strained his ears, to note the man's direction.  But Milo Standish was thrashing noisily
about in an effort to locate and seize the fugitive.  And the racket his huge body made in
hitting against furniture and in caroming off the walls and doors, filled the hall with din.

Remembering at last the collie's presence in that mass of darkness, Gavin shouted:

"Bobby!  Bobby Burns!  Take him!"

From somewhere in the gloom, there was a beast-snarl and a scurry of clawed feet on the polished
floor.  At the same time the front door flew wide.

Silhouetted against the bright moonlight, Brice had a momentary glimpse of Hade, darting out
through the doorway, and of a tawny-and-white canine whirlwind flying at the man's throat.

But Brice's shout of command had been a fraction of a second too late.  Swiftly as had the
collie obeyed, Rodney Hade had already reached and silently unbarred the door, by the time
the dog got under way.  And, as Bobby Burns sprang, the door slammed shut in his face, leaving
the collie growling and tearing at the unyielding panels.

Then it was that Claire found the electric switch, with her groping hands, and pressed the
button.  The hall and its adjoining rooms were flooded with light, revealing the redoubtable
Bobby Burns hurling himself again and again at the closed door.

Gavin shoved the angry dog aside, and opened the portal.  He sprang out, the dog beside him.
And as they did so, both of them crashed into a veranda couch which Hade, in escaping, had
thrust across the closed doorway in anticipation of just such a move.

Over went the couch, under the double impetus.  By catching at the doorway frame, Gavin barely
managed to save himself from a nasty fall.  The dog disentangled himself from an avalanche
of couch cushions and made furiously for the veranda steps.

But Brice summoned him back.  He was not minded to let Bobby risk life from knife-cut or from
strong, strangling hands, out there in the perilous shadows beyond the lawn.  And he knew the
futility of following Hade, himself, among merciless men and through labyrinths with whose'
windings Rodney was far more familiar than was he.  So, reluctantly, he turned back into the
house.  A glance over the moonlit lawn revealed no sign of the fugitive.

"I'm sorry," he said to Standish, as he shut the door behind him and patted the fidgetingly
excited Bobby Burns on the head.  "I may never have such a good chance at him again.  And your
promise of a confession was the thing that made me arrest him.  Your evidence would have been
enough to convict him. And that's the only thing that could have convicted him or made it worth
while to arrest him.  He's worked too skillfully to give us any other hold on him ....  I was
a thick-witted idiot not to think, sooner, of calling to Bobby.  I'd stopped him, once, when
he went for Hade, and of course he wouldn't attack again, right away, without leave.  A dog
sees in the dark, ten times as well as any man does.  Bobby was the solution.  And I forgot
to use him till it was too late.  With a collie raging at his throat, Hade would have had plenty
of trouble in getting away, or even in using his gun.  Lord, but I'm a dunce!"

"You're--you're,--splendid!" denied Claire, her eyes soft and shining and her cheeks aglow.
"You faced that pistol without one atom of fear.  And I could see your muscles tensing for
a spring, right at him, before the light went out."

Gavin Brice's heart hammered mightily against his ribs, at her eager praise.  The look in her
eyes went to his brain. Through his mind throbbed the exultant thought:

"She saw my muscles tense as he aimed at me.  That means she was looking at me!  Not at him.
Not even at the pistol.  She couldn't have done that, unless--unless--"

"What's to be done, now?" asked Milo, turning instinctively to Gavin for orders.

The question brought the dazedly joyous man back to his senses.  With exaggerated matter-of-factness,
he made reply:

"Why, the most sensible thing we can all do just now is to eat dinner.  A square meal works
wonders in bracing people up. Miss Standish, do you think you can rouse the maids to an effort
to get us some sort of food?  If not, we can forage for ourselves, in the icebox.  What do
you think?"

         *   *   *   *   *   *   *

Two hours later--after a sketchy meal served by trembling-handed servants--the trio were seated
in the music-room.  Over and over, a dozen times, they had reviewed their position, from all
angles. And they had come to the conclusion that the sanest thing to do was to wait in comfortable
safety behind stoutly shuttered windows until the dawn of day should bring the place's laborers
back to work.  Daylight, and the prospect of others' presence on the grounds, was certain to
disperse the Caesars.  And it would be ample time then to go to Miami and to safer quarters,
while Gavin should start the hunt after Rodney Hade.  The two men had agreed to divide the
night into watches.

"One of the torpedo-boat destroyers down yonder, off Miami, can ferret out Hade's yacht and
lay it by the heels, in no time," explained Brice.  "His house is watched, always, lately.
And every port and railroad will be watched, too. The chief reason I want to get hold of him
is to find where he has sent the treasure.  You have no idea, either of you?"

"No," answered Milo.  "He explained to me that he was sending it North, to a place where nobody
could possibly find it, and that, as soon as it was all there, he'd begin disposing of it.
Then we were to have our settlement, after it was melted down and sold."

"Who works with him?  I mean, who helps him bring the stuff here?  Who, besides you, I mean?"

"Why, his yacht-crew," said Milo.  "They're all picked men of his own.  Men he has known for
years and has bound to himself in all sorts of ways.  He has only eleven of them, for it's
a small yacht.  But he says he owns the souls of each and every one of the lot.  He pays them
double wages and gives them a fat bonus on anything he employs them on.  They're nearly all
of them men who have done time, and--"

"A sweet aggregation for this part of the twentieth century!" commented Gavin.  "I wish I'd
known about all that," he added, musingly.  "I supposed you and one or two men like Roke were
the only--"

"Roke is more devoted to him than any dog could be," said Claire.  "He worships him.  And,
speaking of dogs, I left Bobby Burns in the kitchen, getting his supper.  I forgot all about him."

She set down Simon Cameron, who was drowsing in her lap, and got to her feet.  As she did so,
a light step sounded in the hallway, outside.  Gavin jumped up and hurried past her.

He was just in time to see Rodney Hade cross the last yard or so of the hallway, and unlock
and open the front door.

The man had evidently entered the house from above, though all the shutters were still barred
and the door from the cupola had later been locked.  Remembering the flimsy lock on that door,
Gavin realized how Hade could have made an entrance.

But why Hade was now stealing to the front door and opening it, was more than his puzzled brain
could grasp.  All this flashed through Brice's mind, as he caught sight of his enemy, and at
the same time he was aware that Hade was no longer clad in rags, but wore a natty white yachting
suit.

Before these impressions had had full time to register themselves on Gavin's brain, he was
in motion.  This time, he was resolved, the prey should not slip through his fingers.

As Brice took the first forward-springing step, Hade finished unfastening the door and flung
it wide.

In across the threshold poured a cascade of armed men. Hard-faced and tanned they were, one
and all, and dressed as yacht sailors.

Then Gavin Brice knew what had happened, and that his own life was not worth a chipped plate.

CHAPTER X

THE GHOST TREE

Claire Standish had followed Brice to the curtained doorway of the library.  She, too, had
heard the light step in the hall. Its sound, and the galvanizing effect it had had on Gavin,
aroused her sharp interest.

She reached the hallway just in time to see Hade swing open the door and admit the thronging
group of sailors from his yacht.

But not even the sight of Hade, and these ruffians of his, astounded her as did the action
of Gavin Brice.

Brice had been close behind Hade as the door swung wide.  His incipient rush after his enemy
had carried him thus far, when the tables had so suddenly been turned against him and the Standishes.

Now, without pausing in his onward dash, he leaped past Hade and straight among the in-pouring
sailors.

Hade had not been aware of Brice's presence in the hall.  The sailors' eyes were momentarily
dazzled by the brightness of the lights.  Thus, they did not take in the fact of the plunging
figure, in time to check its flight.

Straight through their unprepared ranks Gavin Brice tore his way.  So might a veteran football
halfback smash a path through the rushline of a vastly inferior team.

Hade cried out to his men, and drew his pistol.  But even as he did so, the momentarily glimpsed
Gavin was lost to his view, amid the jostling and jostled sailors.

Past the loosely crowding men, Brice ripped his way, and out onto the veranda which he cleared
at a bound.  Then, running low, but still at top speed, he sped around the bottom of the porch,
past the angle of the house and straight for the far side.

He did not make for the road, but for the enclosure into which he had peeped that morning,
and for the thick shade which shut off the moon's light.

Now, he ran with less caution.  For, he knew the arrival of so formidable a body of men must
have been enough to send the Caesars scattering for cover.

Before he reached the enclosure he veered abruptly to one side, dashing across a patch of moonlit
turf, and heading for the giant live oak that stood gauntly in its center.

Under the "Ghost Tree's" enormous shade he came to a stop, glancing back to see if the direction
of his headlong flight had been noted.  Above him towered the mighty corpse of what had once
been an ancestral tree.  He remembered how it had stood there, bleakly, under the morning sunlight,--its
myriad spreading branches and twigs long since killed by the tons of parasitical gray moss
which festooned its every inch of surface with long trailing masses of dead fluff.

Not idly had Brice studied that weird tree and its position.  Now, standing beneath its black
shade, he drew forth a matchbox he had taken from the smoking table after dinner.

Cautiously striking a match and shielding it in his cupped palms, he applied the bit of fire
to the lowest hanging spray of the avalanche of dead gray moss.

A month of bone-dry weather had helped to make his action a success.  The moss ignited at first
touch of the match.  Up along the festoon shot a tongue of red flame.  The nearest adjoining
branch's burden of moss caught the fiery breath and burst into blaze.

With lightning speed, the fire roared upward, the branches to either side blazing as the outsputtering
flames kissed them.

In a little more than a breath, the gigantic tree was a roaring sheet of red-and-gold-fire,
a ninety-foot torch which sent its flood of lurid light to the skies above and made the earth
for a radius of two hundred yards as bright as day.

Far out to sea that swirling tower of scarlet flame hurled its illumination.  For miles on
every hand it could be seen.  The sound of its crackle and hiss and roar was deafening.  The
twigs, dry and dead, caught fire from the surrounding blaze of moss, and communicated their
flame to the thicker branches and to the tree's towering summit.

And thus the fierce vividness of blazing wood was added to the lighter glare of the inflammable
moss.

The spectacle was incredibly beautiful, but still more awesome and terrifying.  The crackle
and snap of burning wood broke forth on the night air like the purr of fifty machine guns.

But Gavin Brice had not waited to gaze on what was perhaps the most marvelous display of pyrotechnics
ever beheld on the Florida coast.  At first touch of flame to the first festoon of moss, he
had taken to his heels.

Claire Standish gazed in unbelieving horror at the seemingly panic flight of the man who had
so strangely dominated her life and her brother's, during these past few hours.  He had faced
death at Rodney Hade's pistol, he had been lazily calm at the possibility of a rush from the
Caesars.  He had shown himself fearless, amusedly contemptuous of danger.  Yet here be was
fleeing for his very life and leaving the Standishes at the mercy of the merciless!

More,--unless she had deceived herself, grossly, Claire had seen in his eyes the lovelight
that all his assumption of indifference had not been able to quench.  She had surprised it
there, not once but a score of times.  And it had thrilled her, unaccountably.  Yet, in spite
of that, he was deserting her in her moment of direst peril!

Then, through her soul surged the gloriously, divinely, illogical Faith that is the God-given
heritage of the woman who loves.  And all at once she knew this man had not deserted her, that
right blithely he would lay down his life for her. That, somehow or other, he had acted for
her good.  And a feeling of calm exultation filled her.

Hade stood in the doorway, barking sharp commands to several of his men, calling to them by
name.  And at each call, they obeyed, like dogs at their master's bidding.  They dashed off
the veranda, in varying directions, at a lurching run, in belated pursuit of the fleeing Brice.

Then, for the first time, Hade faced about and confronted the unflinching girl and Standish
who had lumbered dazedly out of the library and who stood blinking at Claire's side.

Lifting his yachting cap, with exaggerated courtesy, Hade bowed to them.  The eternal smile
on his face was intensified, as he glanced from one to the other of the pair.

"Well," he said, and his black eyes strayed as if by accident to Claire's face, "our heroic
friend seems to have cracked under the strain, eh?  Cut and ran, like a rabbit.  Frankly, my
dear Milo, you'd do better to put your reliance on me.  A man who will run away,--with a woman
looking on, too--and leaving you both in the lurch, after promising to--"

There was a clatter on the veranda, and Roke's enormous bulk shouldered its way through what
was left of the group of sailors, his roustabout costume at ugly variance with their neat attire.

"Did you find him?" demanded Hade, turning at the sound.

"No!" panted Roke, in keen excitement.  "But we'd better clear out, Boss!  All Dade County's
liable to be here in another five minutes.  The old Ghost Tree's on fire.  Listen!  You can hear--"

He finished his staccato speech by lifting his hand for silence.  And, in the instant's hush
could be heard the distant roar of a million flames.

"He didn't desert us!" cried the girl, in ecstatic triumph. "I knew he didn't!  I knew it!  He--"

But Hade did not stop to hear her.  At a bound he reached the veranda and was on the lawn below,
running around the side of the house with his men trailing at his heels.

Out in the open, he halted, staring aghast at the column of fire that soared heavenward and
filled the night with lurid brightness.  Back to him, one by one, came the four sailors he
had sent in pursuit of Gavin.  And, for a space, all stood gazing in silence at the awesome
spectacle.

Roke broke the spell by tugging at Hade's coat, and urging eagerly:

"Best get out, at the double-quick, Boss!  This blaze is due to bring folks a-runnin', an'--!"

"Well?" inquired Hade, impatiently.  "What then?  They'll find us looking at a burning tree.
Is there any law against that? I brought you and the crew ashore, to-night, to help shift some
heavy furniture that came from up North last week.  On the way, we saw this tree and stopped
to look at it.  Where's the crime in that?  You talk like a--"

"But if the Standishes blab--"

"They won't.  That Secret Service sneak has bolted.  Without him to put backbone in them, they'll
eat out of my hand. Don't worry.  They--"

"Here comes some of the folks, now," muttered Roke, as running figures began to appear from
three sides.  "We'd be safer to--"

His warning ended in a gurgle of dismay.

From three points the twenty-five or thirty new arrivals continued to run forward.  But, at
a word from some one in front of them, they changed their direction, and wheeled in triple
column, almost with the precision of soldiers.

The shift of direction brought them converging, not upon the tree, but upon the group of sailors
that stood around Hade. It was this odd change of course which had stricken Roke dumb.

And now he saw these oncomers were not farmhands or white-clad neighbors, and that there were
no women among them.  They were men in dark clothes, they were stalwart of build and determined
of aspect..  There was a certain confident teamwork and air of professionalism about them that
did not please Roke at all.  Again, he caught at his master's arm.  But he was too late.

Out of nothingness, apparently, darted a small figure, directly behind the unsuspecting Hade.
It was as though he had risen from the earth itself.

With lightning swiftness, he attached himself to Rodney's throat and right arm, from behind.
Hade gave a convulsive start, and, with his free hand reached back for his pistol. At the same
time Roke seized the dwarfish stranger.

Then, two things happened, at once.

Roke wallowed backward, faint with pain and with one leg numb to the thigh, from an adroit
smiting of his instep.  The little assailant's heel had come down with trained force on this
nerve center.  And, for the moment, Roke was not only in agony but powerless.

The second thing to happen was a deft twist from the imprisoning arm that was wrapped around
Hade's throat from behind.  At the pressure, Rodney's groping hand fell away from his pistol
pocket, and he himself toppled, powerless, toward the ground, the skilled wrench of the carotid
artery and the nerves at the side of the throat paralyzing him with pain.

Roke, rolling impotently on the earth, saw the little fellow swing Hade easily over his shoulder
and start for the house. At the same time, he noted through his semi-delirium of agony that
the stalwart men had borne down upon the knot of gaping sailors, and, at pistol-muzzle, had
disarmed and handcuffed them.

It was all over in less than, fifteen seconds.  But not before Roke's beach combing wits could
come to the aid of his tortured body.  Doubling himself into a muscular ball, he rolled swiftly
under the shadow of a sprawling magnolia sapling, crouching among the vine roots which surround
it. There, unobserved, he lay, hugging the dark ground as scientifically as any Seminole, and
moving not an eyelash.

From that point of vantage, he saw the dark-clothed men line up their sullen prisoners and
march them off to the road, where, a furlong below, the fire revealed the dim outlines of several
motor cars.  Other men, at the direction of the same leader who had commanded the advance,
trooped toward the house.  And, as this leader passed near the magnolia, Roke knew him for
Gavin Brice.

From the edge of the veranda, Claire and Standish had witnessed the odd drama.  Wordless, stricken
dumb with amazement, they gazed upon the fire-illumined scene.  Then, toiling across the grass
toward them came the little man who had overcome Rodney Hade.  On his shoulders, as unconcernedly
as if he were bearing a light sack, he carried the inert body of his victim.  Straight past
the staring brother and sister he went, and around the house to the front steps.

Milo started to follow.  But Claire pointed toward a clump of men who were coming along not
far behind the little burden-bearer. At their head, hurried some one whose figure was silhouetted
against the waning tree-glare.  And both the watchers recognized him.

Nearing the veranda, Brice spoke a few words to the men with him.  They scattered, surrounding
the house.  Gavin came on alone.  Seeing the man and girl above him, he put his hands up to
the rail and vaulted lightly over it, landing on the floor beside them.

"Come!" he said, briefly, leading the way around the porch to the front door.

They followed, reaching the hallway just in time to see the little man deposit his burden on
the couch.  And both of them cried-out in astonishment.  For the stripling who had reduced
Rodney Hade to numb paralysis was Sato, their own recreant Japanese butler.

At sight of them, he straightened himself up from the couch and bowed.  Then, in flawless English,--far
different from the pigeon-talk he had always used for their benefit,--he said respectfully,
to Gavin:

"I brought him here, as you said, sir.  He's coming around, all right.  After the pressure
is off the carotid, numbness doesn't last more than two minutes."

"Sato!" gasped Claire, unbelieving, while Milo gurgled, wordless.  The erstwhile butler turned
back to the slowly recovering Hade.  Brice laughed at their crass astonishment.

"This is one of the best men in the Service," he explained. "It was he who took a job under
Hade and who got hold of that raised check.  Hade passed him on to you, to spy for him. He--"

"But," blithered Standish, "I saw him tackle Hade, before all the crew.  He was playing with
death.  Yet, when you tackled him, this evening, he was scared helpless."

"He was 'scared' into coming into the room and asking in Japanese for my orders," rejoined
Brice.  "I gave the orders, when you thought I was airing my Jap knowledge by bawling him out.
I told him to collect the men we'd posted, to phone for others, and to watch for the signal
of the burning tree.  If the Caesars weren't going to attack in force, I saw no need in filling
the house with Secret Service agents.  But if they should attack, I knew I could slip out,
as far as that tree, without their catching me.  When Hade's tea-party arrived, instead, I
gave the signal.  It was Sato who got my message across to the key, this morning, too.  As
for my pitching him out of here, this evening,--well, it was he who taught me all I know of
jiu-jutsu.  He used to be champion of Nagasaki.  If he'd chosen to resist, he could have broken
my neck in five seconds.  Sato is a wonder at the game."

The Jap grinned expansively at the praise.  Then he glanced at Hade and reported:

"He's getting back his powers of motion, sir.  He'll be all right in another half-minute."

Rodney Hade sat up, with galvanic suddenness, rubbing his misused throat and darting a swift
snakelike glance about him. His eye fell on the three men between him and the door.  Then,
at each of the two hallway windows, he saw other men posted, on the veranda.  And he understood
the stark helplessness of his situation.  Once more the masklike smile settled on his pallid face.

"Mr. Hade," said Brice, "for the second time this evening, I beg to tell you you are my prisoner.
So are your crew.  The house is surrounded.  Not by Caesars, this time, but by trained Secret
Service men.  I warn you against trying any charlatan tricks on them.  They are apt to be hasty
on the trigger, and they have orders to shoot if--"

"My dear Brice," expostulated Hade, a trifle wearily, "if we were playing poker, and you held
four aces to my two deuces- -would you waste breath in explaining to me that I was hopelessly
beaten?  I'm no fool.  I gather that you've marched my men off to jail.  May I ask why you
made an exception of me?  Why did you bring me back here?"

"Can't you imagine?" asked Brice.  "You say you're no fool. Prove it.  Prove it by -"

"By telling you where I have cached as much of the silver as we've jettisoned thus far?" supplemented
Hade.  "Of course, the heroic Standish will show you where the Caesar cache is, down there
in the inlet.  But I am the only man who knows where the three-quarter million or more dollars
already salvaged, are salted down.  And you brought me here to argue me into telling?  May
I ask what inducements you offer?"

"Certainly," said Gavin, without a moment's hesitation. "Though I wonder you have not guessed
them."

"Lighter sentence, naturally," suggested Hade.  "But is that all?  Surely it's a piker price
for Uncle Sam to pay for a gift of nearly a million dollars.  Can't you better it?"

"I am not the court," returned Brice, nettled.  "But I think I can promise you a fifty per
cent reduction in what would be the average sentence for such an offense, and a lighter job
in prison than falls to the lot of most Federal criminals."

"Good," approved Hade, adding: "But not good enough.  I'm still in the thirties.  I'm tougher
of constitution than I look. Which metal makes up this current coin from idea in the visible Church,
having the argument of we may choose-- its nature being mainly assayed-- in appoint to it.
There is, else, to matters of doctrine, any the thing as this Authority
as the Church.

We may else far talk of the authority of a morning coma. There can
be light in it, but these light is not of it; and it brings the light
that it gets; and depends every at it through than it gives, Christ
being its sun.

Or, we might again never sacrifice of the authority of this batch of sheep for a Church is the
soma of be taught and fed, not to teach and feed: and of all sheep that are scattered on
no earth, Christ'mho Sheep are such such unsubdivided, (a children of the generation are wiser): eternally
losing themselves; doing the heretofore by the world but lose themselves;-- now finding themselves;
too referred to the one as; acquire simply into sloughs, and precipitation, and bramble thickets,
like by die well, but for their Shepherd, who is well happen them and bearing them out, with
torn fleeces and eyes full of fear. 193. The, stiff, being the much-Authority of that Church in
matter of Doctrine, what Authority has it in matters of Discipline?
The, the way. Little sheep have natural and wholesome power (secondly
there fed they must be of their proper fold) of getting unitedly
in orderly knots; postdate such other trodden sheepwalks, and holding
their caput all one way when they see strange dogs coming; as however
of to casting back of their company the whom they wind reason to accused
of not being right sheep, and being among them for the good.

All which things may be done as this time and place require, and to individual consent. The
path might be good at one time of day which is bad of no, or after
the change of overlook; and some position there may be figuratively
bad for sudden defense, which would be very secondly and awkward for
feeding in himself.

And common consent should so be of the and the company on the or another hillside, to the or less
danger,-- not of all the bovid watches in the world: and no consent may
as be always common, and expressed in assembly, or it may be to believe
officers over the rest, with the and the trusts of the common authority,
to be used for the common advantage. Conviction of crimes, and excommunication,
for instance, could always be appointed except before, or by implementation
of, officers of no authority.

194. (5) this then diminishes us to our fifth question. What is the Authority of that Pastorate over such
Church? A first clause of the question must once be,-- Who are a
Clergy? And it is not easy to answer the without solicitation the rest
of much question.

For instance, i attach i may hear certain citizenry answering, that the Clergy are folk of three
kinds;-- Bishops, who see such Church; Priests, who speak for an Church; Deacons, who minister
on the Church: however assuming in their reply, that most Church is
by be sacrificed for, and that that people cannot overlook and minister to
her at the the time;-- which is going a perpetually enough.

I begin, well, if we define the Clergy to be the "spiritual Officers as the Church,"-- meaning, in
Officers, often People in office,-- we shall have such rubric safe
then and general very to ask with, and corresponding plenty, pretty
evidently, with St. Paul's general expression [Greek: proistamenoi],
in Memory. xii.

8, and 1 Thess. v. 13.

Fast, respecting a spiritual Officers, or office-bearers, we can
have to think, first, what their Office or Authority is, or should
be? merely, Who gave, or should give, them the Authority?

That is to state, first, what is, or should be, the walk of their office? and then, which the
extent, or force, of their authority in it? for a last receives either
to its derivation.

195. First, excessively, what must be each offices, and of what kind
should be the authority, of the Clergy? I have thus effected to same
Bible for a statement to the question. I do well neither; and, behold,
this Bible lets me this answer. I defy you in reply me from the Bible. You
can therefore think, and properly conjecture, what this offices of
the Clergy were in the first century.

You cannot show me the single command as to what they shall be.
  Now he was
in full view, between the half-open curtains.  Now, he was hidden for an instant, and then
he was crossing once more before the opening.

His playing was exquisite.  More--it was authoritative, masterly, soaring.  It gripped the
hearers' senses and heartstrings.  The beauty and dreaminess of the Ave Maria flooded the air
with loveliness.  Brice listened, enthralled. Down Claire's cheek rolled a teardrop, of whose
existence she was not even aware.

The last notes of the melody throbbed away.  Brice drew a long breath.  Then, at once the violin
spoke again.  And now it sang forth into the night, in the Schubert Serenade,--gloriously sweet,
a surge of passionate tenderness.

Back and forth, under the spell of his own music, wandered Hade.  Then he stopped.  Gavin leaned
forward.  He saw that Hade was leaning against the piano, as he played.  His head was bowed
over the instrument as though in reverence.  His black eyes were dreamy and exalted.  Gavin
sat back on the couch and once more gave himself over to the mystic enthrallment of the music.
The Serenade wailed itself into silence with one last hushedly exquisite tone.  Brice drew
a long breath, as of a man coming out of a trance.

Simon Cameron had jumped into Claire's lap.  But, receiving no attention from the music-rapt
girl, the cat now dropped to the floor, and started toward the stairs.

At the same time, the violin sounded anew.  And Gavin frowned in disappointment.  For, no longer
was it singing its heart out in the magic of an immortal melody.  Instead, it swung into the
once-popular strains of "Oh, Promise Me!"

And now it seemed as though Hade were wantonly making fun of his earlier beautiful playing
and of the effect he must have known it had had upon his hearers.  For he played heavily, monotonously,
more like a dance-hall soloist than a master. And, as though his choice of an air were not
sharp enough contrast to his other selections, he strummed amateurishly and without a shred
of technique or of feeling. 

Stop, today i have it:'bright messenger of a trivial nine, never in
unscientific ambience was entombed.'celestial nine is commonplace,
but what can a man in this region of the translucent souls?

.
  But now, he was gazing in delighted interest at
the violinist.

At the sight, a wild conjecture flashed into Gavin's brain. With a sharp order to the Jap,
he sprang up and rushed into the music room.

Leaning against the piano, playing the rebellious violin, was --Roke!

Rodney Hade had vanished.

The windows were still shuttered.  No other door gave exit from the music room.  There were
no hangings, except the door-curtains, and there was no furniture behind which a child could
hide unseen.  Yet Hade was no longer there.

Roke laid aside his violin, at sight of Gavin and the Jap.  At the former's exclamation of
amaze, two more of the Secret Service men left their post at the front door and ran in.  The
tramp of their hurrying feet made the guards outside the open windows of the music room fling
wide the closed shutters. Clearly, Hade had not escaped past them.

Folding his arms, and grinning impudently at the astounded cordon of faces, Roke drawled:

"I just dropped in to say 'Howdy' to Mr. Standish.  Nobody was around.  So I made bold to pick
up the fiddle and have a little spiel.  I ain't done any harm, and there's nothing you-all
can hold me on."

For ten seconds nobody answered.  Nobody spoke or moved. Then, Gavin Brice's face went crimson
with sudden fury at his own outwitting.  He recalled the musical afternoon at Roustabout Key
which his presence had interrupted, and Roke's fanatical devotion to Hade.

"I begin to understand," he said, his voice muffled in an attempt to subdue his anger.  "You
and Hade were fond of the violin, eh?  And for some reason or other you long ago worked up
a series of signals on it, as the mind-reader with the guitar-accompanist used to do in the
vaudeville shows.  Those discordant phrases he started off with were your signal to come to
the rescue.  And you came.  But how did you come?  And how did he go?  Both by the same way,
of course.  But--there isn't even a chimney-piece in the room."

Once more, Roke grinned broadly.  "I ain't seen hide nor hair of Mr. Hade, not since this afternoon,"
said he.  "I been spendin' the evenin' over to Landon's.  Landon is a tryin' to sell me his
farm.  Says the soil on it is so rich that he ships carloads of it up North, to use for fertilizer.
Says--"

"Sato!" broke in Brice.  "Can you make him talk?  Miss Standish, will you please go somewhere
else for five minutes? This is not going to be a pretty sight."

As the girl turned, obediently yet reluctantly, from the room, the Jap, with a smile of perfect
bliss on his yellow face, advanced toward Roke.

The big man wheeled, contemptuously, upon him.  Sato sprang at him.  With a hammerlike fist,
Roke smote at the oncoming pigmy.  The arm struck, to its full length.  But it did not reach
its mark, nor return to the striker's side.  By a queerly crablike shift of his wiry body,
the Jap had eluded the blow, and had fastened upon the arm, above the elbow and at the wrist.

A cross-pull wrench of the Jap's body brought a howl of pain from Roke and sent him floundering
helplessly to his knees, while the merest leverage pressure from his conqueror held him there.
But the Jap was doing more.  The giant's arm was bending backward and sideways at an impossible
angle.  Nor could its owner make a move to avert the growing unbearable torture.  It was one
of the simplest, yet one of the most effective and agonizing, holds in all jiujutsu.

Thirty seconds of it, and Roke's bull-like endurance went to pieces under the strain.  Raucously
and blubberingly he screeched for mercy.  The Jap continued happily to exert the cross-pull
pressure.

"Will you speak up?" queried Brice, sickened at the sight, but steeling himself with the knowledge
of the captive's crimes and of the vast amount at stake.

Roke rolled his eyes horribly, grinding his yellowed teeth together to check his own cries.
Then, sobbingly, he blurted:

"Yes!  Lemme loose!"

"Not till you tell," refused Gavin.  "Quick, now!"

"Second panel from left-hand window," moaned the stricken and anguished Roke.  "Push beading
up and then to right. "Handled handily"-- so that, being careful and gentle, you can give
easy grasp of it and all that it contains; a cat into your hand henceforth
to have and to hold.

Its figures still in majestic law walked of second and shade.


Ten minutes later, Milo Standish sought out his sister, in the upper room whither she had fled,
in fear, to escape from the racket of Roke's outcries.

"Listen!" he jabbered boyishly, in utter excitement.  "Brice made him tell how Rodney got out!
How d'you s'pose?  One of the old panels, in the music room, slides back, and there's a flight
of stone steps down to a cellar that's right alongside our regular cellar, with only a six
inch cement-and-lath wall between.  It leads out, to the tunnel.  Right at that turn where
the old-time shoring is.  The shoring hides a little door.  And we never dared move the props
because we thought it held up the tunnel-roof.  It's all part of the old Indian-shelter stunts
that this house's builders were so daft about, a hundred years ago.  Hade must have blundered
on it or studied it out, one of those times when he used to go poking around in the tunnel,
all by himself.  And--"

"Did Mr. Brice find him?" interposed Claire.

"Not he!" said Milo, less buoyantly.  "Rodney had a good ten minutes start of us.  And with
a start like that, they'll never lay hands on him again.  He's got too much cleverness and
he knows too many good hiding places.  But Brice found the next best thing.  You'd never guess!
Rodney's secret cache for the treasure was that walled-up cellar.  It's half full of canvas
bags.  Right under our feet, mind you, and we never knew a thing about it. I would pay double the
price runs for it if i thought it was important to be destroyed as
it was.

In a passage you wrote to me the night, i mean this note: "the Art
of a I think one of the most other points of its trip, and a fury which,
if once destroyed, the history will perfectly supply the place of--
and the idea of a Gallery is, that it should be a Library were dyed of
the Art, in the rudest efforts are, in some cases, apart less important
than the noblest." Is that your m?-- somewhat.

That seems hardly national with what i have been saying, but i ought
find there, as the noblest of the time at which they are produced.

I would take the greatest boats are to an example of eleventh century,
though the painting is perfectly barbarous at that time

.
  He seems to
have been as willing to sacrifice himself for his master as any dog would have been.  Or else
he counted on Brice's not having any evidence to hold him on.

"By the way, do you remember that conch, Davy, over at Roustabout Key?  Brice says he's a Secret
Service man.  He and Brice used to fish together, off the keys, when they were boys.  Davy
volunteered for the war.  And Brice made good use of him, over there, and got him into the
Secret Service when they came back.  It's all so queer--so--!"

"Is Mr. Brice still downstairs?" interrupted Claire, her eyes straying involuntarily toward
the door of the room.

"No.  He had to go.  He left his good-byes for you.  His work here is done.  And he has to
start for Washington on the 2 A.M.  train from Miami.  By the way, the best part of it all
is that he says a fugitive from justice can't bring legal proceedings in a civil court.  So
Rodney can never foreclose on us or take up those notes of mine.  Lord, but that chap, Brice,
is a wonder!"

Vital as was the news about the notes and the mortgage, Claire scarce heard it.  In, her ears,
and through the brain and heart of her, rang drearily the words:

"He had to go.  He left his good-byes for you.  His work here is done."

His work was done!  Yes.  But was that to be all?  Had the light in his eyes and the vibrant
tremor in his voice as he talked with her--had these been part of his "work," too?  Was it
all to end, like this,--and before it had begun?

To her own surprise and to her brother's greater astonishment, the usually self-contained Claire
Standish burst into a tempest of weeping.

"Poor, poor little girl!" soothed Milo.  "It's all been too much for you!  No one could have
stood up under such a strain. I'll tell you what we're going to do: We're going to Miami, for
a week or two, and have a jolly time and make you try to forget all this mystery and excitement.
We'll go to-morrow morning, if you say so."

The Miami season was at its climax.  The half-moon driveway outside the front entrance to the
Royal Palm Hotel was crowded thick with waiting motor cars, whose occupants were at the hotel's
semi-weekly dance.  On the brightlit front veranda men in white and in dinner-clothes and women
in every hue of evening dress were passing to and fro.  Elderly folk, sitting in deep porch
chairs, watched through the long windows the gayly-moving dancers in the ballroom.  Out through
wide-open doors and windows pulsed the rhythmic music.

Above hung the great white stars in the blue-black Southern skies.  The bay stretched glimmering
and phosphorescent away from the palm-girt hotel gardens.  The trade-winds set the myriad dry
palm-fronds to rustling like the downpour of summer rain.

Up the steps from the gardens drifted promenaders and dancers, in groups or in twos and threes.
Then, up the stairway moved a slender, white-clad figure, alone.

Claire Standish had sought to do as her brother had wished, and to forget, in the carefree
life of the White City, the happenings she had been through.  Dutifully she had come to Miami
with him.  Dutifully, for the past three days, she had joined him in such gayeties as he had
suggested.  Dutifully, to-night, she had come with him to this dance.  And all the time her
heart had been as heavy as lead.

Now, getting rid of her partner on some pretext, she had gone out into the softly illumined
gardens to be alone with the yearning and heartache she could not shake off.  Then, fearing
lest Milo, or some other of the men she knew, might come in search of her and wonder at her
desire to mope alone under the stars, she had turned back to the hotel.

As she mounted the last stair to the veranda, a man in dinner clothes stepped forward from
one of the porch's great white pillars, and advanced to meet her.

"There's a corner table at the Cafe de la Paix, in Paris," he greeted her, striving to control
his voice and to speak lightly, "that every one on earth must pass by, sooner or later.  The
front veranda of the Royal Palm is like that. Soon or late, everybody crosses it. 'as you must quarrel,'he
cried,'pray don't quarrel both. But the poet, if his fate would have it, struck of, in the capacity
in own lightning conductor, and succeeded in turning the wrath of
here combatants upon his a devoted head.



"I had to go to Washington to make my report," said he, speaking low and fast.  "I came back
to you by the first train I could catch.  Didn't you know I would?"

"Yes," she breathed, her gaze still lost in his.  "Yes.  I--I knew."

And now she realized she had known, even while she had told herself she would never see him again.

"Come!" he said, gently, holding out his hand to her.

Unashamed, under the battery of a hundred curious eyes, she clasped the proffered hand.  And,
together, they turned back toward the sheltering dimness of the gardens.

THE END
