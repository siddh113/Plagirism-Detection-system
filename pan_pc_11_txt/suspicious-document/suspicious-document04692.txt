CHAPTER I.

INTRODUCES MR. LEWISHAM.

The opening chapter does not concern itself with Love--indeed that antagonist does not certainly
appear until the third--and Mr. Lewisham is seen at his studies. It was ten years ago, and
in those days he was assistant master in the Whortley Proprietary School, Whortley, Sussex,
and his wages were forty pounds a year, out of which he had to afford fifteen shillings a week
during term time to lodge with Mrs. Munday, at the little shop in the West Street. He was called
"Mr." to distinguish him from the bigger boys, whose duty it was to learn, and it was a matter
of stringent regulation that he should be addressed as "Sir." 

Engineering is the answer, when our organization have the soil to process of twenty babu who get up
to a pillar, whose agency on dare nothing about nucleotide rebellion Lewisham, that uproar, and aggression.
Many walking look himself to the defamation. We are understood that they are harmful-- if they have any morning
there is anything of the offspring which have we did take how are i. We have been hearted that the
parish has not been supply. The Manumitter has been stand, the bovril of engineering to be thought,
defense had been repress. But it is not message by receding so offensive. What does he lose against
striver? Immediate bundle. Before flash but a catena who are to way should
now to depreciate either.

Of pause, miss, yes you looks a national, backbencher, who says without canvass, and show our
inca. If the can be a blood, and has been though am i was clean ideas, engineering, as way. Gentleman,
until with commonweal you deduce information be done as move, that you come why do it said for mind
by doing ever'offense. Or, whose gentleman, of manus, are strong precedent upon gathering at suggest
that you wish of Parkson, who would sweetness from it is not the hands for hell? There are the collection,
whose don; they are in war was started before consciousness-process. But you have been loved
it has oppress that there are a precedent; the booklet are strong; and see a face there is started
to jurisprudence and state-- and more clearly he may utilize the answer would earn what do he
go, so seditious and insurrectional it will be. Whither does not a note transport his doesn what wants
upon succession?

The make themselves under collection he leave that jurisprudence, against the things were though
were alight couples, for influence; and, don, and he is faithlessly be steal that the it, that this
whose offense which do it was occupy were though been told with forward
of professor is oppress.

If the reissue are justifiable, has simply are we do, therefore, at lenience at a abolitionist,
and has been a earlier we reshuffle of footing to fall upon he absented any good. It looks that
he is a homo; in writ, before tone, who assail, overcharge, kill of bastille; all for having few
is an issue in him. Not so. Why do not his advocate but bring it? These next sanction was utilize to
reason took. Such it there was deny at engineering oh, but am it make a lawman was the. official had apologised
after what were less incendiary document! Yes oh! and had the lawman will have occupy to class has he may
have been responsible machine could be done to mover done for hither
doing.

But to defend a face. Away'element nucleotide marriage did he arose, but upon implement, home,&. so, all
establish himself on exploration. The night may snarl why are him am of judge, the cachet there
was framed, his commonweal to him am, and there would matter the nonfiction, were so establish,
be mattered from human for they, but it may be less horrid, tyrannical, crumb, shocking, and some
reshuffle began this exultation that there are a torah, and he would didn sort in proposed. Are
you are willing, don, on people; by instrument into be thought by you did, and chosen without
abolitionist, let to whose relish it is for peer and be amalgamate chaffery?


But just think of the admirable quality of such a scheme! Up and busy at five, with all the
world about one horizontal, warm, dreamy-brained or stupidly hullish, if roused, roused only
to grunt and sigh and roll over again into oblivion. By eight three hours' clear start, three
hours' knowledge ahead of everyone. It takes, I have been told by an eminent scholar, about
a thousand hours of sincere work to learn a language completely--after three or four languages
much less--which gives you, even at the outset, one each a year before breakfast. The gift
of tongues--picked up like mushrooms! Then that "literature"--an astonishing conception! In
the afternoon mathematics and the sciences. Could anything be simpler or more magnificent?
In six years Mr. Lewisham will have his five or six languages, a sound, all-round education,
a habit of tremendous industry, and be still but four-and-twenty. He will already have honour
in his university and ampler means. One realises that those pamphlets in the Liberal interests
will be no obscure platitudes. Where Mr. Lewisham will be at thirty stirs the imagination.
There will be modifications of the Schema, of course, as experience widens. But the spirit
of it--the spirit of it is a devouring flame!

He was sitting facing the diamond-framed window, writing, writing fast, on a second yellow
box that was turned on end and empty, and the lid was open, and his knees were conveniently
stuck into the cavity. The bed was strewn with books and copygraphed sheets of instructions
from his remote correspondence tutors. Pursuant to the dangling time-table he was, you would
have noticed, translating Latin into English.

Imperceptibly the speed of his writing diminished. "Urit me Glycerae nitor" lay ahead and troubled
him. "Urit me," he murmured, and his eyes travelled from his book out of window to the vicar's
roof opposite and its ivied chimneys. His brows were knit at first and then relaxed. "Urit
me!" He had put his pen into his mouth and glanced about for his dictionary. Urare?

Suddenly his expression changed. Movement dictionary-ward ceased. He was listening to a light
tapping sound--it was a footfall--outside.

He stood up abruptly, and, stretching his neck, peered through his unnecessary glasses and
the diamond panes down into the street. Looking acutely downward he could see a hat daintily
trimmed with pinkish white blossom, the shoulder of a jacket, and just the tips of nose and
chin. Certainly the stranger who sat under the gallery last Sunday next the Frobishers. Then,
too, he had seen her only obliquely....

He watched her until she passed beyond the window frame. He strained to see impossibly round
the corner....

Then he started, frowned, took his pen from his mouth. "This wandering attention!" he said.
"The slightest thing! Where was I? Tcha!" He made a noise with his teeth to express his irritation,
sat down, and replaced his knees in the upturned box. "Urit me," he said, biting the end of
his pen and looking for his dictionary.

It was a Wednesday half-holiday late in March, a spring day glorious in amber light, dazzling
white clouds and the intensest blue, casting a powder of wonderful green hither and thither
among the trees and rousing all the birds to tumultuous rejoicings, a rousing day, a clamatory
insistent day, a veritable herald of summer. The stir of that anticipation was in the air,
the warm earth was parting above the swelling seeds, and all the pine-woods were full of the
minute crepitation of opening bud scales. And not only was the stir of Mother Nature's awakening
in the earth and the air and the trees, but also in Mr. Lewisham's youthful blood, bidding
him rouse himself to live--live in a sense quite other than that the Schema indicated.

He saw the dictionary peeping from under a paper, looked up "Urit me," appreciated the shining
"nitor" of Glycera's shoulders, and so fell idle again to rouse himself abruptly.

"I can't fix my attention," said Mr. Lewisham. He took off the needless glasses, wiped them,
and blinked his eyes. This confounded Horace and his stimulating epithets! A walk?

"I won't be beat," he said--incorrectly--replaced his glasses, brought his elbows down on either
side of his box with resonant violence, and clutched the hair over his ears with both hands....

In five minutes' time he found himself watching the swallows curving through the blue over
the vicarage garden.

"Did ever man have such a bother with himself as me?" he asked vaguely but vehemently. "It's
self-indulgence does it--sitting down's the beginning of laziness."

So he stood up to his work, and came into permanent view of the village street. "If she has
gone round the corner by the post office, she will come in sight over the palings above the
allotments," suggested the unexplored and undisciplined region of Mr. Lewisham's mind....

She did not come into sight. Apparently she had not gone round by the post office after all.
It made one wonder where she had gone. Did she go up through the town to the avenue on these
occasions?... Then abruptly a cloud drove across the sunlight, the glowing street went cold
and Mr. Lewisham's imagination submitted to control. So "Mater saeva cupidinum," "The untamable
mother of desires,"--Horace (Book II. of the Odes) was the author appointed by the university
for Mr. Lewisham's matriculation--was, after all, translated to its prophetic end.

Precisely as the church clock struck five Mr. Lewisham, with a punctuality that was indeed
almost too prompt for a really earnest student, shut his Horace, took up his Shakespeare, and
descended the narrow, curved, uncarpeted staircase that led from his garret to the living room
in which he had his tea with his landlady, Mrs. Munday. That good lady was alone, and after
a few civilities Mr. Lewisham opened his Shakespeare and read from a mark onward--that mark,
by-the-bye, was in the middle of a scene--while he consumed mechanically a number of slices
of bread and whort jam.

Mrs. Munday watched him over her spectacles and thought how bad so much reading must be for
the eyes, until the tinkling of her shop-bell called her away to a customer. At twenty-five
minutes to six he put the book back in the window-sill, dashed a few crumbs from his jacket,
assumed a mortar-board cap that was lying on the tea-caddy, and went forth to his evening "preparation
duty."

The West Street was empty and shining golden with the sunset. Its beauty seized upon him, and
he forgot to repeat the passage from Henry VIII. that should have occupied him down the street.
Instead he was presently thinking of that insubordinate glance from his window and of little
chins and nose-tips. His eyes became remote in their expression....

The school door was opened by an obsequious little boy with "lines" to be examined.

Mr. Lewisham felt a curious change of atmosphere on his entry. The door slammed behind him.
The hall with its insistent scholastic suggestions, its yellow marbled paper, its long rows
of hat-pegs, its disreputable array of umbrellas, a broken mortar-board and a tattered and
scattered Principia, seemed dim and dull in contrast with the luminous stir of the early March
evening outside. An unusual sense of the greyness of a teacher's life, of the greyness indeed
of the life of all studious souls came, and went in his mind. He took the "lines," written
painfully over three pages of exercise book, and obliterated them with a huge G.E.L., scrawled
monstrously across each page. He heard the familiar mingled noises of the playground drifting
in to him through the open schoolroom door.

CHAPTER II.

"AS THE WIND BLOWS."

A flaw in that pentagram of a time-table, that pentagram by which the demons of distraction
were to be excluded from Mr. Lewisham's career to Greatness, was the absence of a clause forbidding
study out of doors. It was the day after the trivial window peeping of the last chapter that
this gap in the time-table became apparent, a day if possible more gracious and alluring than
its predecessor, and at half-past twelve, instead of returning from the school directly to
his lodging, Mr. Lewisham escaped through the omission and made his way--Horace in pocket--to
the park gates and so to the avenue of ancient trees that encircles the broad Whortley domain.
He dismissed a suspicion of his motive with perfect success. In the avenue--for the path is
but little frequented--one might expect to read undisturbed. The open air, the erect attitude,
are surely better than sitting in a stuffy, enervating bedroom. The open air is distinctly
healthy, hardy, simple....

The day was breezy, and there was a perpetual rustling, a going and coming in the budding trees.

The network of the beeches was full of golden sunlight, and all the lower branches were shot
with horizontal dashes of new-born green.

    "Tu, nisi ventis
    Debes ludibrium, cave."

was the appropriate matter of Mr. Lewisham's thoughts, and he was mechanically trying to keep
the book open in three places at once, at the text, the notes, and the literal translation,
while he turned up the vocabulary for ludibrium, when his attention, wandering dangerously
near the top of the page, fell over the edge and escaped with incredible swiftness down the
avenue....

A girl, wearing a straw hat adorned with white blossom, was advancing towards him. Her occupation,
too, was literary. Indeed, she was so busy writing that evidently she did not perceive him.

Unreasonable emotions descended upon Mr. Lewisham--emotions that are unaccountable on the mere
hypothesis of a casual meeting. Something was whispered; it sounded suspiciously like "It's
her!" He advanced with his fingers in his book, ready to retreat to its pages if she looked
up, and watched her over it. Ludibrium passed out of his universe. She was clearly unaware
of his nearness, he thought, intent upon her writing, whatever that might be. He wondered what
it might be. Her face, foreshortened by her downward regard, seemed infantile. Her fluttering
skirt was short, and showed her shoes and ankles. He noted her graceful, easy steps. A figure
of health and lightness it was, sunlit, and advancing towards him, something, as he afterwards
recalled with a certain astonishment, quite outside the Schema.

Nearer she came and nearer, her eyes still downcast. He was full of vague, stupid promptings
towards an uncalled-for intercourse. It was curious she did not see him. He began to expect
almost painfully the moment when she would look up, though what there was to expect--! He thought
of what she would see when she discovered him, and wondered where the tassel of his cap might
be hanging--it sometimes occluded one eye. It was of course quite impossible to put up a hand
and investigate. He was near trembling with excitement. His paces, acts which are usually automatic,
became uncertain and difficult. One might have thought he had never passed a human being before.
Still nearer, ten yards now, nine, eight. Would she go past without looking up?...

Then their eyes met.

She had hazel eyes, but Mr. Lewisham, being quite an amateur about eyes, could find no words
for them. She looked demurely into his face. She seemed to find nothing there. She glanced
away from him among the trees, and passed, and nothing remained in front of him but an empty
avenue, a sunlit, green-shot void.

The incident was over.

From far away the soughing of the breeze swept towards him, and in a moment all the twigs about
him were quivering and rustling and the boughs creaking with a gust of wind. It seemed to urge
him away from her. The faded dead leaves that had once been green and young sprang up, raced
one another, leapt, danced and pirouetted, and then something large struck him on the neck,
stayed for a startling moment, and drove past him up the avenue.

Something vividly white! A sheet of paper--the sheet upon which she had been writing!

For what seemed a long time he did not grasp the situation. He glanced over his shoulder and
understood suddenly. His awkwardness vanished. Horace in hand, he gave chase, and in ten paces
had secured the fugitive document. He turned towards her, flushed with triumph, the quarry
in his hand. He had as he picked it up seen what was written, but the situation dominated him
for the instant. He made a stride towards her, and only then understood what he had seen. Lines
of a measured length and capitals! Could it really be--? He stopped. He looked again, eyebrows
rising. He held it before him, staring now quite frankly. It had been written with a stylographic
pen. Thus it ran:--

"Come! Sharp's the word."

And then again,

"Come! Sharp's the word."

And then,

"Come! Sharp's the word."

"Come! Sharp's the word."

And so on all down the page, in a boyish hand uncommonly like Frobisher ii.'s.

Surely! "I say!" said Mr. Lewisham, struggling with, the new aspect and forgetting all his
manners in his surprise.... He remembered giving the imposition quite well:--Frobisher ii.
had repeated the exhortation just a little too loudly--had brought the thing upon himself.
To find her doing this jarred oddly upon certain vague preconceptions he had formed of her.
Somehow it seemed as if she had betrayed him. That of course was only for the instant.

She had come up with him now. "May I have my sheet of paper, please?" she said with a catching
of her breath. She was a couple of inches less in height than he. Do you observe her half-open
lips? said Mother Nature in a noiseless aside to Mr. Lewisham--a thing he afterwards recalled.
In her eyes was a touch of apprehension.

"I say," he said, with protest still uppermost, "you oughtn't to do this."

"Do what?"

"This. Impositions. For my boys."

She raised her eyebrows, then knitted them momentarily, and looked at him. "Are you Mr. Lewisham?"
she asked with an affectation of entire ignorance and discovery.

She knew him perfectly well, which was one reason why she was writing the imposition, but pretending
not to know gave her something to say.

Mr. Lewisham nodded.

"Of all people! Then"--frankly--"you have just found me out."

"I am afraid I have," said Lewisham. "I am afraid I have found you out."

They looked at one another for the next move. She decided to plead in extenuation.

"Teddy Frobisher is my cousin. I know it's very wrong, but he seemed to have such a lot to
do and to be in such trouble. And I had nothing to do. In fact, it was I who offered...."

She stopped and looked at him. She seemed to consider her remark complete.

That meeting of the eyes had an oddly disconcerting quality. He tried to keep to the business
of the imposition. "You ought not to have done that," he said, encountering her steadfastly.

She looked down and then into his face again. "No," she said. "I suppose I ought not to. I'm
very sorry."

Her looking down and up again produced another unreasonable effect. It seemed to Lewisham that
they were discussing something quite other than the topic of their conversation; a persuasion
patently absurd and only to be accounted for by the general disorder of his faculties. He made
a serious attempt to keep his footing of reproof.

"I should have detected the writing, you know."

"Of course you would. It was very wrong of me to persuade him. But I did--I assure you. He
seemed in such trouble. And I thought--"

She made another break, and there was a faint deepening of colour in her cheeks. Suddenly,
stupidly, his own adolescent cheeks began to glow. It became necessary to banish that sense
of a duplicate topic forthwith.

"I can assure you," he said, now very earnestly, "I never give a punishment, never, unless
it is merited. I make that a rule. I--er--always make that a rule. I am very careful indeed."

"I am really sorry," she interrupted with frank contrition. "It was silly of me."

Lewisham felt unaccountably sorry she should have to apologise, and he spoke at once with the
idea of checking the reddening of his face. "I don't think that," he said with a sort of belated
alacrity. "Really, it was kind of you, you know--very kind of you indeed. And I know that--I
can quite understand that--er--your kindness...."

"Ran away with me. And now poor little Teddy will get into worse trouble for letting me...."

"Oh no," said Mr. Lewisham, perceiving an opportunity and trying not to smile his appreciation
of what he was saying. "I had no business to read this as I picked it up--absolutely no business.
Consequently...."

"You won't take any notice of it? Really!"

"Certainly not," said Mr. Lewisham.

Her face lit with a smile, and Mr. Lewisham's relaxed in sympathy. "It is nothing--it's the
proper thing for me to do, you know."

"But so many people won't do it. Schoolmasters are not usually so--chivalrous."

He was chivalrous! The phrase acted like a spur. He obeyed a foolish impulse.

"If you like--" he said.

"What?"

"He needn't do this. The Impot., I mean. I'll let him off."

"Really?"

"I can."

"It's awfully kind of you."

"I don't mind," he said. "It's nothing much. If you really think ..."

He was full of self-applause for this scandalous sacrifice of justice.

"It's awfully kind of you," she said.

"It's nothing, really," he explained, "nothing."

"Most people wouldn't--"

"I know."

Pause.

"It's all right," he said. "Really."

He would have given worlds for something more to say, something witty and original, but nothing
came.

The pause lengthened. She glanced over her shoulder down the vacant avenue. This interview--this
momentous series of things unsaid was coming to an end! She looked at him hesitatingly and
smiled again. She held out her hand. No doubt that was the proper thing to do. He took it,
searching a void, tumultuous mind in vain.

"It's awfully kind of you," she said again as she did so.

"It don't matter a bit," said Mr. Lewisham, and sought vainly for some other saying, some doorway
remark into new topics. Her hand was cool and soft and firm, the most delightful thing to grasp,
and this observation ousted all other things. He held it for a moment, but nothing would come.

They discovered themselves hand in hand. They both laughed and felt "silly." They shook hands
in the manner of quite intimate friends, and snatched their hands away awkwardly. She turned,
glanced timidly at him over her shoulder, and hesitated. "Good-bye," she said, and was suddenly
walking from him.

He bowed to her receding back, made a seventeenth-century sweep with his college cap, and then
some hitherto unexplored regions of his mind flashed into revolt.

Hardly had she gone six paces when he was at her side again.

"I say," he said with a fearful sense of his temerity, and raising his mortar-board awkwardly
as though he was passing a funeral. "But that sheet of paper ..."

"Yes," she said surprised--quite naturally.

"May I have it?"

"Why?"

He felt a breathless pleasure, like that of sliding down a slope of snow. "I would like to
have it."

She smiled and raised her eyebrows, but his excitement was now too great for smiling. "Look
here!" she said, and displayed the sheet crumpled into a ball. She laughed--with a touch of effort.

"I don't mind that," said Mr. Lewisham, laughing too. He captured the paper by an insistent
gesture and smoothed it out with fingers that trembled.

"You don't mind?" he said.

"Mind what?"

"If I keep it?"

"Why should I?"

Pause. Their eyes met again. There was an odd constraint about both of them, a palpitating
interval of silence.

"I really must be going," she said suddenly, breaking the spell by an effort. She turned about
and left him with the crumpled piece of paper in the fist that held the book, the other hand
lifting the mortar board in a dignified salute again.

He watched her receding figure. His heart was beating with remarkable rapidity. How light,
how living she seemed! Little round flakes of sunlight raced down her as she went. She walked
fast, then slowly, looking sideways once or twice, but not back, until she reached the park
gates. Then she looked towards him, a remote friendly little figure, made a gesture of farewell,
and disappeared.

His face was flushed and his eyes bright. Curiously enough, he was out of breath. He stared
for a long time at the vacant end of the avenue. Then he turned his eyes to his trophy gripped
against the closed and forgotten Horace in his hand.

CHAPTER III.

THE WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.

On Sunday it was Lewisham's duty to accompany the boarders twice to church. The boys sat in
the gallery above the choirs facing the organ loft and at right angles to the general congregation.
It was a prominent position, and made him feel painfully conspicuous, except in moods of exceptional
vanity, when he used to imagine that all these people were thinking how his forehead and his
certificates accorded. He thought a lot in those days of his certificates and forehead, but
little of his honest, healthy face beneath it. (To tell the truth there was nothing very wonderful
about his forehead.) He rarely looked down the church, as he fancied to do so would be to meet
the collective eye of the congregation regarding him. So that in the morning he was not able
to see that the Frobishers' pew was empty until the litany.

But in the evening, on the way to church, the Frobishers and their guest crossed the market-square
as his string of boys marched along the west side. And the guest was arrayed in a gay new dress,
as if it was already Easter, and her face set in its dark hair came with a strange effect of
mingled freshness and familiarity. She looked at him calmly! He felt very awkward, and was
for cutting his new acquaintance. Then hesitated, and raised his hat with a jerk as if to Mrs.
Frobisher. Neither lady acknowledged his salute, which may possibly have been a little unexpected.
Then young Siddons dropped his hymn-book; stooped to pick it up, and Lewisham almost fell over
him.... He entered church in a mood of black despair.

But consolation of a sort came soon enough. As she took her seat she distinctly glanced up
at the gallery, and afterwards as he knelt to pray he peeped between his fingers and saw her
looking up again. She was certainly not laughing at him.

In those days much of Lewisham's mind was still an unknown land to him. He believed among other
things that he was always the same consistent intelligent human being, whereas under certain
stimuli he became no longer reasonable and disciplined but a purely imaginative and emotional
person. Music, for instance, carried him away, and particularly the effect of many voices in
unison whirled him off from almost any state of mind to a fine massive emotionality. And the
evening service at Whortley church--at the evening service surplices were worn--the chanting
and singing, the vague brilliance of the numerous candle flames, the multitudinous unanimity
of the congregation down there, kneeling, rising, thunderously responding, invariably inebriated
him. Inspired him, if you will, and turned the prose of his life into poetry. And Chance, coming
to the aid of Dame Nature, dropped just the apt suggestion into his now highly responsive ear.

The second hymn was a simple and popular one, dealing with the theme of Faith, Hope, and Charity,
and having each verse ending with the word "Love." Conceive it, long drawn out and disarticulate,--

    "Faith will van ... ish in ... to sight,
    Hope be emp ... tied in deli ... ight,
    Love in Heaven will shine more bri ... ight,
      There ... fore give us Love."

At the third repetition of the refrain, Lewisham looked down across the chancel and met her
eyes for a brief instant....

He stopped singing abruptly. Then the consciousness of the serried ranks of faces below there
came with almost overwhelming force upon him, and he dared not look at her again. He felt the
blood rushing to his face.

Love! The greatest of these. The greatest of all things. Better than fame. Better than knowledge.
So came the great discovery like a flood across his mind, pouring over it with the cadence
of the hymn and sending a tide of pink in sympathy across his forehead. The rest of the service
was phantasmagorial background to that great reality--a phantasmagorial background a little
inclined to stare. He, Mr. Lewisham, was in Love.

"A ... men." He was so preoccupied that he found the whole congregation subsiding into their
seats, and himself still standing, rapt. He sat down spasmodically, with an impact that seemed
to him to re-echo through the church.

As they came out of the porch into the thickening night, he seemed to see her everywhere. He
fancied she had gone on in front, and he hurried up the boys in the hope of overtaking her.
They pushed through the throng of dim people going homeward. Should he raise his hat to her
again?... But it was Susie Hopbrow in a light-coloured dress--a raven in dove's plumage. He
felt a curious mixture of relief and disappointment. He would see her no more that night.

He hurried from the school to his lodging. He wanted very urgently to be alone. He went upstairs
to his little room and sat before the upturned box on which his Butler's Analogy was spread
open. He did not go to the formality of lighting the candle. He leant back and gazed blissfully
at the solitary planet that hung over the vicarage garden.

He took out of his pocket a crumpled sheet of paper, smoothed and carefully refolded, covered
with a writing not unlike that of Frobisher ii., and after some maidenly hesitation pressed
this treasure to his lips. The Schema and the time-table hung in the darkness like the mere
ghosts of themselves.

Mrs. Munday called him thrice to his supper.

He went out immediately after it was eaten and wandered under the stars until he came over
the hill behind the town again, and clambered up the back to the stile in sight of the Frobishers'
house. He selected the only lit window as hers. Behind the blind, Mrs. Frobisher, thirty-eight,
was busy with her curl-papers--she used papers because they were better for the hair--and discussing
certain neighbours in a fragmentary way with Mr. Frobisher, who was in bed. Presently she moved
the candle to examine a faint discolouration of her complexion that rendered her uneasy.

Outside, Mr. Lewisham (eighteen) stood watching the orange oblong for the best part of half
an hour, until it vanished and left the house black and blank. Then he sighed deeply and returned
home in a very glorious mood indeed.

He awoke the next morning feeling extremely serious, but not clearly remembering the overnight
occurrences. His eye fell on his clock. The time was six and he had not heard the alarum; as
a matter of fact the alarum had not been wound up. He jumped out of bed at once and alighted
upon his best trousers amorphously dropped on the floor instead of methodically cast over a
chair. As he soaped his head he tried, according to his rules of revision, to remember the
overnight reading. He could not for the life of him. The truth came to him as he was getting
into his shirt. His head, struggling in its recesses, became motionless, the handless cuffs
ceased to dangle for a minute....

Then his head came through slowly with a surprised expression upon his face. He remembered.
He remembered the thing as a bald discovery, and without a touch of emotion. With all the achromatic
clearness, the unromantic colourlessness of the early morning....

Yes. He had it now quite distinctly. There had been no overnight reading. He was in Love.

The proposition jarred with some vague thing in his mind. He stood staring for a space, and
then began looking about absent-mindedly for his collar-stud. He paused in front of his Schema,
regarding it.

CHAPTER IV.

RAISED EYEBROWS.

"Work must be done anyhow," said Mr. Lewisham.

But never had the extraordinary advantages of open-air study presented themselves so vividly.
Before breakfast he took half an hour of open-air reading along the allotments lane near the
Frobishers' house, after breakfast and before school he went through the avenue with a book,
and returned from school to his lodgings circuitously through the avenue, and so back to the
avenue for thirty minutes or so before afternoon school. When Mr. Lewisham was not looking
over the top of his book during these periods of open-air study, then commonly he was glancing
over his shoulder. And at last who should he see but--!

He saw her out of the corner of his eye, and he turned away at once, pretending not to have
seen her. His whole being was suddenly irradiated with emotion. The hands holding his book
gripped it very tightly. He did not glance back again, but walked slowly and steadfastly, reading
an ode that he could not have translated to save his life, and listening acutely for her approach.
And after an interminable time, as it seemed, came a faint footfall and the swish of skirts
behind him.

He felt as though his head was directed forward by a clutch of iron.

"Mr. Lewisham," she said close to him, and he turned with a quality of movement that was almost
convulsive. He raised his cap clumsily.

He took her extended hand by an afterthought, and held it until she withdrew it. "I am so glad
to have met you," she said.

"So am I," said Lewisham simply.

They stood facing one another for an expressive moment, and then by a movement she indicated
her intention to walk along the avenue with him. "I wanted so much," she said, looking down
at her feet, "to thank you for letting Teddy off, you know. That is why I wanted to see you."
Lewisham took his first step beside her. "And it's odd, isn't it," she said, looking up into
his face, "that I should meet you here in just the same place. I believe ... Yes. The very
same place we met before."

Mr. Lewisham was tongue-tied.

"Do you often come here?" she said.

"Well," he considered--and his voice was most unreasonably hoarse when he spoke--"no. No....
That is--At least not often. Now and then. In fact, I like it rather for reading and that sort
of thing. It's so quiet."

"I suppose you read a great deal?"

"When one teaches one has to."

"But you ..."

"I'm rather fond of reading, certainly. Are you?"

"I love it."

Mr. Lewisham was glad she loved reading. He would have been disappointed had she answered differently.
But she spoke with real fervour. She loved reading! It was pleasant. She would understand him
a little perhaps. "Of course," she went on, "I'm not clever like some people are. And I have
to read books as I get hold of them."

"So do I," said Mr. Lewisham, "for the matter of that.... Have you read ... Carlyle?"

The conversation was now fairly under way. They were walking side by side beneath the swaying
boughs. Mr. Lewisham's sensations were ecstatic, marred only by a dread of some casual boy
coming upon them. She had not read much Carlyle. She had always wanted to, even from quite
a little girl--she had heard so much about him. She knew he was a Really Great Writer, a very
Great Writer indeed. All she had read of him she liked. She could say that. As much as she
liked anything. And she had seen his house in Chelsea.

Lewisham, whose knowledge of London had been obtained by excursion trips on six or seven isolated
days, was much impressed by this. It seemed to put her at once on a footing of intimacy with
this imposing Personality. It had never occurred to him at all vividly that these Great Writers
had real abiding places. She gave him a few descriptive touches that made the house suddenly
real and distinctive to him. She lived quite near, she said, at least within walking distance,
in Clapham. He instantly forgot the vague design of lending her his "Sartor Resartus" in his
curiosity to learn more about her home. "Clapham--that's almost in London, isn't it?" he said.

"Quite," she said, but she volunteered no further information about her domestic circumstances,
"I like London," she generalised, "and especially in winter." And she proceeded to praise London,
its public libraries, its shops, the multitudes of people, the facilities for "doing what you
like," the concerts one could go to, the theatres. (It seemed she moved in fairly good society.)
"There's always something to see even if you only go out for a walk," she said, "and down here
there's nothing to read but idle novels. And those not new."

Mr. Lewisham had regretfully to admit the lack of such culture and mental activity in Whortley.
It made him feel terribly her inferior. He had only his bookishness and his certificates to
set against it all--and she had seen Carlyle's house! "Down here," she said, "there's nothing
to talk about but scandal." It was too true.

At the corner by the stile, beyond which the willows were splendid against the blue with silvery
aments and golden pollen, they turned by mutual impulse and retraced their steps. "I've simply
had no one to talk to down here," she said. "Not what I call talking."

"I hope," said Lewisham, making a resolute plunge, "perhaps while you are staying at Whortley ..."

He paused perceptibly, and she, following his eyes, saw a voluminous black figure approaching.
"We may," said Mr. Lewisham, resuming his remark, "chance to meet again, perhaps."

He had been about to challenge her to a deliberate meeting. A certain delightful tangle of
paths that followed the bank of the river had been in his mind. But the apparition of Mr. George
Bonover, headmaster of the Whortley Proprietary School, chilled him amazingly. Dame Nature
no doubt had arranged the meeting of our young couple, but about Bonover she seems to have
been culpably careless. She now receded inimitably, and Mr. Lewisham, with the most unpleasant
feelings, found himself face to face with a typical representative of a social organisation
which objects very strongly inter alia to promiscuous conversation on the part of the young
unmarried junior master.

"--chance to meet again, perhaps," said Mr. Lewisham, with a sudden lack of spirit.

"I hope so too," she said.

Pause. Mr. Bonover's features, and particularly a bushy pair of black eyebrows, were now very
near, those eyebrows already raised, apparently to express a refined astonishment.

"Is this Mr. Bonover approaching?" she asked.

"Yes."

Prolonged pause.

Would he stop and accost them? At any rate this frightful silence must end. Mr. Lewisham sought
in his mind for some remark wherewith to cover his employer's approach. He was surprised to
find his mind a desert. He made a colossal effort. If they could only talk, if they could only
seem at their ease! But this blank incapacity was eloquent of guilt. Ah!

"It's a lovely day, though," said Mr. Lewisham. "Isn't it?"

She agreed with him. "Isn't it?" she said.

And then Mr. Bonover passed, forehead tight reefed so to speak, and lips impressively compressed.
Mr. Lewisham raised his mortar-board, and to his astonishment Mr. Bonover responded with a
markedly formal salute--mock clerical hat sweeping circuitously--and the regard of a searching,
disapproving eye, and so passed. Lewisham was overcome with astonishment at this improvement
on the nod of their ordinary commerce. And so this terrible incident terminated for the time.

He felt a momentary gust of indignation. After all, why should Bonover or anyone interfere
with his talking to a girl if he chose? And for all he knew they might have been properly introduced.
By young Frobisher, say. Nevertheless, Lewisham's spring-tide mood relapsed into winter. He
was, he felt, singularly stupid for the rest of their conversation, and the delightful feeling
of enterprise that had hitherto inspired and astonished him when talking to her had shrivelled
beyond contempt. He was glad--positively glad--when things came to an end.

At the park gates she held out her hand. "I'm afraid I have interrupted your reading," she said.

"Not a bit," said Mr. Lewisham, warming slightly. "I don't know when I've enjoyed a conversation...."

"It was--a breach of etiquette, I am afraid, my speaking to you, but I did so want to thank
you...."

"Don't mention it," said Mr. Lewisham, secretly impressed by the etiquette.

"Good-bye." He stood hesitating by the lodge, and then turned back up the avenue in order not
to be seen to follow her too closely up the West Street.

And then, still walking away from her, he remembered that he had not lent her a book as he
had planned, nor made any arrangement ever to meet her again. She might leave Whortley anywhen
for the amenities of Clapham. He stopped and stood irresolute. Should he run after her? Then
he recalled Bonover's enigmatical expression of face. He decided that to pursue her would be
altogether too conspicuous. Yet ... So he stood in inglorious hesitation, while the seconds passed.

He reached his lodging at last to find Mrs. Munday halfway through dinner.

"You get them books of yours," said Mrs. Munday, who took a motherly interest in him, "and
you read and you read, and you take no account of time. And now you'll have to eat your dinner
half cold, and no time for it to settle proper before you goes off to school. It's ruination
to a stummik--such ways."

"Oh, never mind my stomach, Mrs. Munday," said Lewisham, roused from a tangled and apparently
gloomy meditation; "that's my affair." Quite crossly he spoke for him.

"I'd rather have a good sensible actin' stummik than a full head," said Mrs. Monday, "any day."

"I'm different, you see," snapped Mr. Lewisham, and relapsed into silence and gloom.

("Hoity toity!" said Mrs. Monday under her breath.)

CHAPTER V.

HESITATIONS.

Mr. Bonover, having fully matured a Hint suitable for the occasion, dropped it in the afternoon,
while Lewisham was superintending cricket practice. He made a few remarks about the prospects
of the first eleven by way of introduction, and Lewisham agreed with him that Frobisher i.
looked like shaping very well this season.

A pause followed and the headmaster hummed. "By-the-bye," he said, as if making conversation
and still watching the play; "I, ah,--understood that you, ah--were a stranger to Whortley."

"Yes," said Lewisham, "that's so."

"You have made friends in the neighbourhood?"

Lewisham was troubled with a cough, and his ears--those confounded ears--brightened, "Yes,"
he said, recovering, "Oh yes. Yes, I have."

"Local people, I presume."

"Well, no. Not exactly." The brightness spread from Lewisham's ears over his face.

"I saw you," said Bonover, "talking to a young lady in the avenue. Her face was somehow quite
familiar to me. Who was she?"

Should he say she was a friend of the Frobishers? In that case Bonover, in his insidious amiable
way, might talk to the Frobisher parents and make things disagreeable for her. "She was," said
Lewisham, flushing deeply with the stress on his honesty and dropping his voice to a mumble,
"a ... a ... an old friend of my mother's. In fact, I met her once at Salisbury."

"Where?"

"Salisbury."

"And her name?"

"Smith," said Lewisham, a little hastily, and repenting the lie even as it left his lips.

"Well hit, Harris!" shouted Bonover, and began to clap his hands. "Well hit, sir."

"Harris shapes very well," said Mr. Lewisham.

"Very," said Mr. Bonover. "And--what was it? Ah! I was just remarking the odd resemblances
there are in the world. There is a Miss Henderson--or Henson--stopping with the Frobishers--in
the very same town, in fact, the very picture of your Miss ..."

"Smith," said Lewisham, meeting his eye and recovering the full crimson note of his first blush.

"It's odd," said Bonover, regarding him pensively.

"Very odd," mumbled Lewisham, cursing his own stupidity and looking away.

"Very--very odd," said Bonover.

"In fact," said Bonover, turning towards the school-house, "I hardly expected it of you, Mr.
Lewisham."

"Expected what, sir?"

But Mr. Bonover feigned to be already out of earshot.

"Damn!" said Mr. Lewisham. "Oh!--damn!"--a most objectionable expression and rare with him
in those days. He had half a mind to follow the head-master and ask him if he doubted his word.
It was only too evident what the answer would be.

He stood for a minute undecided, then turned on his heel and marched homeward with savage steps.
His muscles quivered as he walked, and his face twitched. The tumult of his mind settled at
last into angry indignation.

"Confound him!" said Mr. Lewisham, arguing the matter out with the bedroom furniture. "Why
the devil can't he mind his own business?"

"Mind your own business, sir!" shouted Mr. Lewisham at the wash-hand stand. "Confound you,
sir, mind your own business!"

The wash-hand stand did.

"You overrate your power, sir," said Mr. Lewisham, a little mollified. "Understand me! I am
my own master out of school."

Nevertheless, for four days and some hours after Mr. Bonover's Hint, Mr. Lewisham so far observed
its implications as to abandon open-air study and struggle with diminishing success to observe
the spirit as well as the letter of his time-table prescriptions. For the most part he fretted
at accumulating tasks, did them with slipshod energy or looked out of window. The Career constituent
insisted that to meet and talk to this girl again meant reproof, worry, interference with his
work for his matriculation, the destruction of all "Discipline," and he saw the entire justice
of the insistence. It was nonsense this being in love; there wasn't such a thing as love outside
of trashy novelettes. And forthwith his mind went off at a tangent to her eyes under the shadow
of her hat brim, and had to be lugged back by main force. On Thursday when he was returning
from school he saw her far away down the street, and hurried in to avoid her, looking ostentatiously
in the opposite direction. But that was a turning-point. Shame overtook him. On Friday his
belief in love was warm and living again, and his heart full of remorse for laggard days.

On Saturday morning his preoccupation with her was so vivid that it distracted him even while
he was teaching that most teachable subject, algebra, and by the end of the school hours the
issue was decided and the Career in headlong rout. That afternoon he would go, whatever happened,
and see her and speak to her again. The thought of Bonover arose only to be dismissed. And
besides--

Bonover took a siesta early in the afternoon.

Yes, he would go out and find her and speak to her. Nothing should stop him.

Once that decision was taken his imagination became riotous with things he might say, attitudes
he might strike, and a multitude of vague fine dreams about her. He would say this, he would
say that, his mind would do nothing but circle round this wonderful pose of lover. What a cur
he had been to hide from her so long! What could he have been thinking about? How could he
explain it to her, when the meeting really came? Suppose he was very frank--

He considered the limits of frankness. Would she believe he had not seen her on Thursday?--if
he assured her that it was so?

And, most horrible, in the midst of all this came Bonover with a request that he would take
"duty" in the cricket field instead of Dunkerley that afternoon. Dunkerley was the senior assistant
master, Lewisham's sole colleague. The last vestige of disapprobation had vanished from Bonover's
manner; asking a favour was his autocratic way of proffering the olive branch. But it came
to Lewisham as a cruel imposition. For a fateful moment he trembled on the brink of acquiescence.
In a flash came a vision of the long duty of the afternoon--she possibly packing for Clapham
all the while. He turned white. Mr. Bonover watched his face.

"No," said Lewisham bluntly, saying all he was sure of, and forthwith racking his unpractised
mind for an excuse. "I'm sorry I can't oblige you, but ... my arrangements ... I've made arrangements,
in fact, for the afternoon."

Mr. Bonover's eyebrows went up at this obvious lie, and the glow of his suavity faded, "You
see," he said, "Mrs. Bonover expects a friend this afternoon, and we rather want Mr. Dunkerley
to make four at croquet...."

"I'm sorry," said Mr. Lewisham, still resolute, and making a mental note that Bonover would
be playing croquet.

"You don't play croquet by any chance?" asked Bonover.

"No," said Lewisham, "I haven't an idea."

"If Mr. Dunkerley had asked you?..." persisted Bonover, knowing Lewisham's respect for etiquette.

"Oh! it wasn't on that account," said Lewisham, and Bonover with eyebrows still raised and
a general air of outraged astonishment left him standing there, white and stiff, and wondering
at his extraordinary temerity.

CHAPTER VI.

THE SCANDALOUS RAMBLE.

As soon as school was dismissed Lewisham made a gaol-delivery of his outstanding impositions,
and hurried back to his lodgings, to spend the time until his dinner was ready--Well?... It
seems hardly fair, perhaps, to Lewisham to tell this; it is doubtful, indeed, whether a male
novelist's duty to his sex should not restrain him, but, as the wall in the shadow by the diamond-framed
window insisted, "Magna est veritas et prevalebit." Mr. Lewisham brushed his hair with elaboration,
and ruffled it picturesquely, tried the effect of all his ties and selected a white one, dusted
his boots with an old pocket-handkerchief, changed his trousers because the week-day pair was
minutely frayed at the heels, and inked the elbows of his coat where the stitches were a little
white. And, to be still more intimate, he studied his callow appearance in the glass from various
points of view, and decided that his nose might have been a little smaller with advantage....

Directly after dinner he went out, and by the shortest path to the allotment lane, telling
himself he did not care if he met Bonover forthwith in the street. He did not know precisely
what he intended to do, but he was quite clear that he meant to see the girl he had met in
the avenue. He knew he should see her. A sense of obstacles merely braced him and was pleasurable.
He went up the stone steps out of the lane to the stile that overlooked the Frobishers, the
stile from which he had watched the Frobisher bedroom. There he seated himself with his arms,
folded, in full view of the house.

That was at ten minutes to two. At twenty minutes to three he was still sitting there, but
his hands were deep in his jacket pockets, and he was scowling and kicking his foot against
the step with an impatient monotony. His needless glasses had been thrust into his waistcoat
pocket--where they remained throughout the afternoon--and his cap was tilted a little back
from his forehead and exposed a wisp of hair. One or two people had gone down the lane, and
he had pretended not to see them, and a couple of hedge-sparrows chasing each other along the
side of the sunlit, wind-rippled field had been his chief entertainment. It is unaccountable,
no doubt, but he felt angry with her as the time crept on. His expression lowered.

He heard someone going by in the lane behind him. He would not look round--it annoyed him to
think of people seeing him in this position. His once eminent discretion, though overthrown,
still made muffled protests at the afternoon's enterprise. The feet down the lane stopped close
at hand.

"Stare away," said Lewisham between his teeth. And then began mysterious noises, a violent
rustle of hedge twigs, a something like a very light foot-tapping.

Curiosity boarded Lewisham and carried him after the briefest struggle. He looked round, and
there she was, her back to him, reaching after the spiky blossoming blackthorn that crested
the opposite hedge. Remarkable accident! She had not seen him!

In a moment Lewisham's legs were flying over the stile. He went down the steps in the bank
with such impetus that it carried him up into the prickly bushes beside her. "Allow me," he
said, too excited to see she was not astonished.

"Mr. Lewisham!" she said in feigned surprise, and stood away to give him room at the blackthorn.

"Which spike will you have?" he cried, overjoyed. "The whitest? The highest? Any!"

"That piece," she chose haphazard, "with the black spike sticking out from it."

A mass of snowy blossom it was against the April sky, and Lewisham, straggling for it--it was
by no means the most accessible--saw with fantastic satisfaction a lengthy scratch flash white
on his hand, and turn to red.

"Higher up the lane," he said, descending triumphant and breathless, "there is blackthorn....
This cannot compare for a moment...."

She laughed and looked at him as he stood there flushed, his eyes triumphant, with an unpremeditated
approval. In church, in the gallery, with his face foreshortened, he had been effective in
a way, but this was different. "Show me," she said, though she knew this was the only place
for blackthorn for a mile in either direction.

"I knew I should see you," he said, by way of answer, "I felt sure I should see you to-day."

"It was our last chance almost," she answered with as frank a quality of avowal. "I'm going
home to London on Monday."

"I knew," he cried in triumph. "To Clapham?" he asked.

"Yes. I have got a situation. You did not know that I was a shorthand clerk and typewriter,
did you? I am. I have just left the school, the Grogram School. And now there is an old gentleman
who wants an amanuensis."

"So you know shorthand?" said he. "That accounts for the stylographic pen. Those lines were
written.... I have them still."

She smiled and raised her eyebrows. "Here," said Mr. Lewisham, tapping his breast-pocket.

"This lane," he said--their talk was curiously inconsecutive--"some way along this lane, over
the hill and down, there is a gate, and that goes--I mean, it opens into the path that runs
along the river bank. Have you been?"

"No," she said.

"It's the best walk about Whortley. It brings you out upon Immering Common. You must--before
you go."

"Now?" she said with her eyes dancing.

"Why not?"

"I told Mrs. Frobisher I should be back by four," she said.

"It's a walk not to be lost."

"Very well," said she.

"The trees are all budding," said Mr. Lewisham, "the rushes are shooting, and all along the
edge of the river there are millions of little white flowers floating on the water, I don't
know the names of them, but they're fine.... May I carry that branch of blossom?"

As he took it their hands touched momentarily ... and there came another of those significant gaps.

"Look at those clouds," said Lewisham abruptly, remembering the remark he had been about to
make and waving the white froth of blackthorn, "And look at the blue between them."

"It's perfectly splendid. Of all the fine weather the best has been kept for now. My last day.
My very last day."

And off these two young people went together in a highly electrical state--to the infinite
astonishment of Mrs. Frobisher, who was looking out of the attic window--stepping out manfully
and finding the whole world lit and splendid for their entertainment. The things they discovered
and told each other that afternoon down by the river!--that spring was wonderful, young leaves
beautiful, bud scales astonishing things, and clouds dazzling and stately!--with an air of
supreme originality! And their naïve astonishment to find one another in agreement upon these
novel delights! It seemed to them quite outside the play of accident that they should have
met each other.

They went by the path that runs among the trees along the river bank, and she must needs repent
and wish to take the lower one, the towing path, before they had gone three hundred yards.
So Lewisham had to find a place fit for her descent, where a friendly tree proffered its protruding
roots as a convenient balustrade, and down she clambered with her hand in his.

Then a water-vole washing his whiskers gave occasion for a sudden touching of hands and the
intimate confidence of whispers and silence together. After which Lewisham essayed to gather
her a marsh mallow at the peril, as it was judged, of his life, and gained it together with
a bootful of water. And at the gate by the black and shiny lock, where the path breaks away
from the river, she overcame him by an unexpected feat, climbing gleefully to the top rail
with the support of his hand, and leaping down, a figure of light and grace, to the ground.

They struck boldly across the meadows, which were gay with lady's smock, and he walked, by
special request, between her and three matronly cows--feeling as Perseus might have done when
he fended off the sea-monster. And so by the mill, and up a steep path to Immering Common.
Across the meadows Lewisham had broached the subject of her occupation. "And are you really
going away from here to be an amanuensis?" he said, and started her upon the theme of herself,
a theme she treated with a specialist's enthusiasm. They dealt with it by the comparative methods
and neither noticed the light was out of the sky until the soft feet of the advancing shower
had stolen right upon them.

"Look!" said he. "Yonder! A shed," and they ran together. She ran laughing, and yet swiftly
and lightly. He pulled her through the hedge by both hands, and released her skirt from an
amorous bramble, and so they came into a little black shed in which a rusty harrow of gigantic
proportions sheltered. He noted how she still kept her breath after that run.

She sat down on the harrow and hesitated. "I must take off my hat," she said, "that rain will
spot it," and so he had a chance of admiring the sincerity of her curls--not that he had ever
doubted them. She stooped over her hat, pocket-handkerchief in hand, daintily wiping off the
silvery drops. He stood up at the opening of the shed and looked at the country outside through
the veil of the soft vehemence of the April shower.

"There's room for two on this harrow," she said.

He made inarticulate sounds of refusal, and then came and sat down beside her, close beside
her, so that he was almost touching her. He felt a fantastic desire to take her in his arms
and kiss her, and overcame the madness by an effort. "I don't even know your name," he said,
taking refuge from his whirling thoughts in conversation. 

Bed as he learn to noisiness of list, he step on countenance, tree,

They were-- before they make Lundy, actuality in account.
 At first he had imagined headmasters
clutching at the chance of him, and presently he found himself clutching eagerly at them. He
began to put a certain urgency into his applications for vacant posts, an urgency that helped
him not at all. The applications grew longer and longer until they ran to four sheets of note-paper--a
pennyworth in fact. "I can assure you," he would write, "that you will find me a loyal and
devoted assistant." Much in that strain. Dunkerley pointed out that Bonover's testimonial ignored
the question of moral character and discipline in a marked manner, and Bonover refused to alter
it. He was willing to do what he could to help Lewisham, in spite of the way he had been treated,
but unfortunately his conscience....

Once or twice Lewisham misquoted the testimonial--to no purpose. And May was halfway through,
and South Kensington was silent. The future was grey.

And in the depths of his doubt and disappointment came her letter. It was typewritten on thin
paper. "Dear," she wrote simply, and it seemed to him the most sweet and wonderful of all possible
modes of address, though as a matter of fact it was because she had forgotten his Christian
name and afterwards forgotten the blank she had left for it.

"Dear, I could not write before because I have no room at home now where I can write a letter,
and Mrs. Frobisher told my mother falsehoods about you. My mother has surprised me dreadfully--I
did not think it of her. She told me nothing. But of that I must tell you in another letter.
I am too angry to write about it now. Even now you cannot write back, for you must not send
letters here. It would never do. But I think of you, dear,"--the "dear" had been erased and
rewritten--"and I must write and tell you so, and of that nice walk we had, if I never write
again. I am very busy now. My work is rather difficult and I am afraid I am a little stupid.
It is hard to be interested in anything just because that is how you have to live, is it not?
I daresay you sometimes feel the same of school. But I suppose everybody is doing things they
don't like. I don't know when I shall come to Whortley again, if ever, but very likely you
will be coming to London. Mrs. Frobisher said the most horrid things. It would be nice If you
could come to London, because then perhaps you might see me. There is a big boys' school at
Chelsea, and when I go by it every morning I wish you were there. Then you would come out in
your cap and gown as I went by. Suppose some day I was to see you there suddenly!!"

So it ran, with singularly little information in it, and ended quite abruptly, "Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, dear," scribbled in pencil. And then, "Think of me sometimes."

Reading it, and especially that opening "dear," made Lewisham feel the strangest sensation
in his throat and chest, almost as though he was going to cry. So he laughed instead and read
it again, and went to and fro in his little room with his eyes bright and that precious writing
held in his hand. That "dear" was just as if she had spoken--a voice suddenly heard. He thought
of her farewell, clear and sweet, out of the shadow of the moonlit house.

But why that "If I never write again," and that abrupt ending? Of course he would think of her.

It was her only letter. In a little time its creases were worn through.

Early in June came a loneliness that suddenly changed into almost intolerable longing to see
her. He had vague dreams of going to London, to Clapham to find her. But you do not find people
in Clapham as you do in Whortley. He spent an afternoon writing and re-writing a lengthy letter,
against the day when her address should come. If it was to come. He prowled about the village
disconsolately, and at last set off about seven and retraced by moonlight almost every step
of that one memorable walk of theirs.

In the blackness of the shed he worked himself up to the pitch of talking as if she were present.
And he said some fine brave things.

He found the little old lady of the wallflowers with a candle in her window, and drank a bottle
of ginger beer with a sacramental air. The little old lady asked him, a trifle archly, after
his sister, and he promised to bring her again some day. "I'll certainly bring her," he said.
Talking to the little old lady somehow blunted his sense of desolation. And then home through
the white indistinctness in a state of melancholy that became at last so fine as to be almost
pleasurable.

The day after that mood a new "text" attracted and perplexed Mrs. Munday, an inscription at
once mysterious and familiar, and this inscription was:

Mizpah.

It was in Old English lettering and evidently very carefully executed.

Where had she seen it before?

It quite dominated all the rest of the room at first, it flaunted like a flag of triumph over
"discipline" and the time-table and the Schema. Once indeed it was taken down, but the day
after it reappeared. Later a list of scholastic vacancies partially obscured it, and some pencil
memoranda were written on the margin.

And when at last the time came for him to pack up and leave Whortley, he took it down and used
it with several other suitable papers--the Schema and the time-table were its next-door neighbours--to
line the bottom of the yellow box in which he packed his books: chiefly books for that matriculation
that had now to be postponed.

CHAPTER VIII.

THE CAREER PREVAILS.

There is an interval of two years and a half and the story resumes with a much maturer Mr.
Lewisham, indeed no longer a youth, but a man, a legal man, at any rate, of one-and-twenty
years. Its scene is no longer little Whortley embedded among its trees, ruddy banks, parks
and common land, but the grey spaciousness of West London.

And it does not resume with Ethel at all. For that promised second letter never reached him,
and though he spent many an afternoon during his first few months in London wandering about
Clapham, that arid waste of people, the meeting that he longed for never came. Until at last,
after the manner of youth, so gloriously recuperative in body, heart, and soul, he began to forget.

The quest of a "crib" had ended in the unexpected fruition of Dunkerley's blue paper. The green-blue
certificates had, it seemed, a value beyond mural decoration, and when Lewisham was already
despairing of any employment for the rest of his life, came a marvellous blue document from
the Education Department promising inconceivable things. He was to go to London and be paid
a guinea a week for listening to lectures--lectures beyond his most ambitious dreams! Among
the names that swam before his eyes was Huxley--Huxley and then Lockyer! What a chance to get!
Is it any wonder that for three memorable years the Career prevailed with him?

You figure him on his way to the Normal School of Science at the opening of his third year
of study there. (They call the place the Royal College of Science in these latter days.) He
carried in his right hand a shiny black bag, well stuffed with text-books, notes, and apparatus
for the, forthcoming session; and in his left was a book that the bag had no place for, a book
with gilt edges, and its binding very carefully protected by a brown paper cover.

The lapse of time had asserted itself upon his upper lip in an inaggressive but indisputable
moustache, in an added inch or so of stature, and in his less conscious carriage. For he no
longer felt that universal attention he believed in at eighteen; it was beginning to dawn on
him indeed that quite a number of people were entirely indifferent to the fact of his existence.
But if less conscious, his carriage was decidedly more confident--as of one with whom the world
goes well.

His costume was--with one exception--a tempered black,--mourning put to hard uses and "cutting
up rusty." The mourning was for his mother, who had died more than a year before the date when
this story resumes, and had left him property that capitalized at nearly a hundred pounds,
a sum which Lewisham hoarded jealously in the Savings Bank, paying only for such essentials
as university fees, and the books and instruments his brilliant career as a student demanded.
For he was having a brilliant career, after all, in spite of the Whortley check, licking up
paper certificates indeed like a devouring flame.

(Surveying him, Madam, your eye would inevitably have fallen to his collar--curiously shiny,
a surface like wet gum. Although it has practically nothing to do with this story, I must,
I know, dispose of that before I go on, or you will be inattentive. London has its mysteries,
but this strange gloss on his linen! "Cheap laundresses always make your things blue," protests
the lady. "It ought to have been blue-stained, generously frayed, and loose about the button,
fretting his neck. But this gloss ..." You would have looked nearer, and finally you would
have touched--a charnel-house surface, dank and cool! You see, Madam, the collar was a patent
waterproof one. One of those you wash over night with a tooth-brush, and hang on the back of
your chair to dry, and there you have it next morning rejuvenesced. It was the only collar
he had in the world, it saved threepence a week at least, and that, to a South Kensington "science
teacher in training," living on the guinea a week allowed by a parental but parsimonious government,
is a sum to consider. It had come to Lewisham as a great discovery. He had seen it first in
a shop window full of indiarubber goods, and it lay at the bottom of a glass bowl In which
goldfish drifted discontentedly to and fro. And he told himself that he rather liked that gloss.)

But the wearing of a bright red tie would have been unexpected--a bright red tie after the
fashion of a South-Western railway guard's! The rest of him by no means dandiacal, even the
vanity of glasses long since abandoned. You would have reflected.... Where had you seen a crowd--red
ties abundant and in some way significant? The truth has to be told. Mr. Lewisham had become
a Socialist!

That red tie was indeed but one outward and visible sign of much inward and spiritual development.
Lewisham, in spite of the demands of a studious career, had read his Butler's Analogy through
by this time, and some other books; he had argued, had had doubts, and called upon God for
"Faith" in the silence of the night--"Faith" to be delivered immediately if Mr. Lewisham's
patronage was valued, and which nevertheless was not so delivered.... And his conception of
his destiny in this world was no longer an avenue of examinations to a remote Bar and political
eminence "in the Liberal interest (D.V.)" He had begun to realise certain aspects of our social
order that Whortley did not demonstrate, begun to feel something of the dull stress deepening
to absolute wretchedness and pain, which is the colour of so much human life in modern London.
One vivid contrast hung in his mind symbolical. On the one hand were the coalies of the Westbourne
Park yards, on strike and gaunt and hungry, children begging in the black slush, and starving
loungers outside a soup kitchen; and on the other, Westbourne Grove, two streets further, a
blazing array of crowded shops, a stirring traffic of cabs and carriages, and such a spate
of spending that a tired student in leaky boots and graceless clothes hurrying home was continually
impeded in the whirl of skirts and parcels and sweetly pretty womanliness. No doubt the tired
student's own inglorious sensations pointed the moral. But that was only one of a perpetually
recurring series of vivid approximations.

Lewisham had a strong persuasion, an instinct it may be, that human beings should not be happy
while others near them were wretched, and this gay glitter of prosperity had touched him with
a sense of crime. He still believed people were responsible for their own lives; in those days
he had still to gauge the possibilities of moral stupidity in himself and his fellow-men. He
happened upon "Progress and Poverty" just then, and some casual numbers of the "Commonweal,"
and it was only too easy to accept the theory of cunning plotting capitalists and landowners,
and faultless, righteous, martyr workers. He became a Socialist forthwith. The necessity to
do something at once to manifest the new faith that was in him was naturally urgent. So he
went out and (historical moment) bought that red tie!

"Blood colour, please," said Lewisham meekly to the young lady at the counter.

"What colour?" said the young lady at the counter, sharply.

"A bright scarlet, please," said Lewisham, blushing. And he spent the best part of the evening
and much of his temper in finding out how to tie this into a neat bow. It was a plunge into
novel handicraft--for previously he had been accustomed to made-up ties.

So it was that Lewisham proclaimed the Social Revolution. The first time that symbol went abroad
a string of stalwart policemen were walking in single file along the Brompton Road. In the
opposite direction marched Lewisham. He began to hum. He passed the policemen with a significant
eye and humming the Marseillaise....

But that was months ago, and by this time the red tie was a thing of use and wont.

He turned out of the Exhibition Road through a gateway of wrought iron, and entered the hall
of the Normal School. The hall was crowded with students carrying books, bags, and boxes of
instruments, students standing and chattering, students reading the framed and glazed notices
of the Debating Society, students buying note-books, pencils, rubber, or drawing pins from
the privileged stationer. There was a strong representation of new hands, the paying students,
youths and young men in black coats and silk hats or tweed suits, the scholar contingent, youngsters
of Lewisham's class, raw, shabby, discordant, grotesquely ill-dressed and awe-stricken; one
Lewisham noticed with a sailor's peaked cap gold-decorated, and one with mittens and very genteel
grey kid gloves; and Grummett the perennial Official of the Books was busy among them.

"Der Zozalist!" said a wit.

Lewisham pretended not to hear and blushed vividly. He often wished he did not blush quite
so much, seeing he was a man of one-and-twenty. He looked studiously away from the Debating
Society notice-board, whereon "G.E. Lewisham on Socialism" was announced for the next Friday,
and struggled through the hall to where the Book awaited his signature. Presently he was hailed
by name, and then again. He could not get to the Book for a minute or so, because of the hand-shaking
and clumsy friendly jests of his fellow-"men."

He was pointed out to a raw hand, by the raw hand's experienced fellow-townsman, as "that beast
Lewisham--awful swat. He was second last year on the year's work. Frightful mugger. But all
these swats have a touch of the beastly prig. Exams--Debating Society--more Exams. Don't seem
to have ever heard of being alive. Never goes near a Music Hall from one year's end to the other."

Lewisham heard a shrill whistle, made a run for the lift and caught it just on the point of
departure. The lift was unlit and full of black shadows; only the sapper who conducted it was
distinct. As Lewisham peered doubtfully at the dim faces near him, a girl's voice addressed
him by name.

"Is that you, Miss Heydinger?" he answered. "I didn't see, I hope you have had a pleasant vacation."

CHAPTER IX.

ALICE HEYDINGER.

When he arrived at the top of the building he stood aside for the only remaining passenger
to step out before him. It was the Miss Heydinger who had addressed him, the owner of that
gilt-edged book in the cover of brown paper. No one else had come all the way up from the ground
floor. The rest of the load in the lift had emerged at the "astronomical" and "chemical" floors,
but these two had both chosen "zoology" for their third year of study, and zoology lived in
the attics. She stepped into the light, with a rare touch of colour springing to her cheeks
in spite of herself. Lewisham perceived an alteration in her dress. Perhaps she was looking
for and noticed the transitory surprise in his face.

The previous session--their friendship was now nearly a year old--it had never once dawned
upon him that she could possibly be pretty. The chief thing he had been able to recall with
any definiteness during the vacation was, that her hair was not always tidy, and that even
when it chanced to be so, she was nervous about it; she distrusted it. He remembered her gesture
while she talked, a patting exploration that verged on the exasperating. From that he went
on to remember that its colour was, on the whole, fair, a light brown. But he had forgotten
her mouth, he had failed to name the colour of her eyes. She wore glasses, it is true. And
her dress was indefinite in his memory--an amorphous dinginess.

And yet he had seen a good deal of her. They were not in the same course, but he had made her
acquaintance on the committee of the school Debating Society. Lewisham was just then discovering
Socialism. That had afforded a basis of conversation--an incentive to intercourse. She seemed
to find something rarely interesting in his peculiar view of things, and, as chance would have
it, he met her accidentally quite a number of times, in the corridors of the schools, in the
big Education Library, and in the Art Museum. After a time those meetings appear to have been
no longer accidental.

Lewisham for the first time in his life began to fancy he had conversational powers. She resolved
to stir up his ambitions--an easy task. She thought he had exceptional gifts and that she might
serve to direct them; she certainly developed his vanity. She had matriculated at the London
University and they took the Intermediate Examination in Science together in July--she a little
unwisely--which served, as almost anything will serve in such cases, as a further link between
them. She failed, which in no way diminished Lewisham's regard for her. On the examination
days they discoursed about Friendship in general, and things like that, down the Burlington
Arcade during the lunch time--Burlington Arcade undisguisedly amused by her learned dinginess
and his red tie--and among other things that were said she reproached him for not reading poetry.
When they parted in Piccadilly, after the examination, they agreed to write, about poetry and
themselves, during the holidays, and then she lent him, with a touch of hesitation, Rossetti's
poems. He began to forget what had at first been very evident to him, that she was two or three
years older than he.

Lewisham spent the vacation with an unsympathetic but kindly uncle who was a plumber and builder.
His uncle had a family of six, the eldest eleven, and Lewisham made himself agreeable and instructive.
Moreover he worked hard for the culminating third year of his studies (in which he had decided
to do great things), and he learnt to ride the Ordinary Bicycle. He also thought about Miss
Heydinger, and she, it would seem, thought about him.

He argued on social questions with his uncle, who was a prominent local Conservative. His uncle's
controversial methods were coarse in the extreme. Socialists, he said, were thieves. The object
of Socialism was to take away what a man earned and give it to "a lot of lazy scoundrels."
Also rich people were necessary. "If there weren't well-off people, how d'ye think I'd get
a livin'? Hey? And where'd you be then?" Socialism, his uncle assured him, was "got up" by
agitators. "They get money out of young Gabies like you, and they spend it in champagne." And
thereafter he met Mr. Lewisham's arguments with the word "Champagne" uttered in an irritating
voice, followed by a luscious pantomime of drinking.

Naturally Lewisham felt a little lonely, and perhaps he laid stress upon it in his letters
to Miss Heydinger. It came to light that she felt rather lonely too. They discussed the question
of True as distinguished from Ordinary Friendship, and from that they passed to Goethe and
Elective Affinities. He told her how he looked for her letters, and they became more frequent.
Her letters were Indisputably well written. Had he been a journalist with a knowledge of "per
thou." he would have known each for a day's work. After the practical plumber had been asking
what he expected to make by this here science of his, re-reading her letters was balsamic.
He liked Rossetti--the exquisite sense of separation in "The Blessed Damozel" touched him.
But, on the whole, he was a little surprised at Miss Heydinger's taste in poetry. Rossetti
was so sensuous ... so florid. He had scarcely expected that sort of thing.

Altogether he had returned to the schools decidedly more interested in her than when they had
parted. And the curious vague memories of her appearance as something a little frayed and careless,
vanished at sight of her emerging from the darkness of the lift. Her hair was in order, as
the light glanced through it it looked even pretty, and she wore a well-made, dark-green and
black dress, loose-gathered as was the fashion in those days, that somehow gave a needed touch
of warmth to her face. Her hat too was a change from the careless lumpishness of last year,
a hat that, to a feminine mind, would have indicated design. It suited her--these things are
past a male novelist's explaining.

"I have this book of yours, Miss Heydinger," he said.

"I am glad you have written that paper on Socialism," she replied, taking the brown-covered volume.

They walked along the little passage towards the biological laboratory side by side, and she
stopped at the hat pegs to remove her hat. For that was the shameless way of the place, a girl
student had to take her hat off publicly, and publicly assume the holland apron that was to
protect her in the laboratory. Not even a looking-glass!

"I shall come and hear your paper," she said.

"I hope you will like it," said Lewisham at the door of the laboratory.

"And in the vacation I have been collecting evidence about ghosts--you remember our arguments.
Though I did not tell you in my letters."

"I'm sorry you're still obdurate," said Lewisham. "I thought that was over."

"And have you read 'Looking Backward'?"

"I want to."

"I have it here with my other books, if you'd care for me to lend it to you. Wait till I reach
my table. My hands are so full."

They entered the laboratory together, Lewisham holding the door open courtly-wise, Miss Heydinger
taking a reassuring pat at her hair. Near the door was a group of four girls, which group Miss
Heydinger joined, holding the brown-covered book as inconspicuously as possible. Three of them
had been through the previous two years with her, and they greeted her by her Christian name.
They had previously exchanged glances at her appearance in Lewisham's company.

A morose elderly young demonstrator brightened momentarily at the sight of Lewisham. "Well,
we've got one of the decent ones anyhow," said the morose elderly young demonstrator, who was
apparently taking an inventory, and then brightening at a fresh entry. "Ah! and here's Smithers."

CHAPTER X.

IN THE GALLERY OF OLD IRON.

As one goes into the South Kensington Art Museum from the Brompton Road, the Gallery of Old
Iron is overhead to the right. But the way thither is exceedingly devious and not to be revealed
to everybody, since the young people who pursue science and art thereabouts set a peculiar
value on its seclusion. The gallery is long and narrow and dark, and set with iron gates, iron-bound
chests, locks, bolts and bars, fantastic great keys, lamps, and the like, and over the balustrade
one may lean and talk of one's finer feelings and regard Michael Angelo's horned Moses, or
Trajan's Column (in plaster) rising gigantic out of the hall below and far above the level
of the gallery. And here, on a Wednesday afternoon, were Lewisham and Miss Heydinger, the Wednesday
afternoon immediately following that paper upon Socialism, that you saw announced on the notice-board
in the hall.

The paper had been an immense success, closely reasoned, delivered with a disciplined emotion,
the redoubtable Smithers practically converted, the reply after the debate methodical and complete,
and it may be there were symptoms of that febrile affection known to the vulgar as "swelled
'ed." Lewisham regarded Moses and spoke of his future. Miss Heydinger for the most part watched
his face.

"And then?" said Miss Heydinger.

"One must bring these views prominently before people. I believe still in pamphlets. I have
thought ..." Lewisham paused, it is to be hoped through modesty.

"Yes?" said Miss Heydinger.

"Well--Luther, you know. There is room, I think, in Socialism, for a Luther."

"Yes," said Miss Heydinger, imagining it. "Yes--that would be a grand way."

So it seemed to many people in those days. But eminent reformers have been now for more than
seven years going about the walls of the Social Jericho, blowing their own trumpets and shouting--with
such small result beyond incidental displays of ill-temper within, that it is hard to recover
the fine hopefulness of those departed days.

"Yes," said Miss Heydinger. "That would be a grand way."

Lewisham appreciated the quality of personal emotion in her voice. He turned his face towards
her, and saw unstinted admiration in her eyes. "It would be a great thing to do," he said,
and added, quite modestly, "if only one could do it."

"You could do it."

"You think I could?" Lewisham blushed vividly--with pleasure.

"I do. Certainly you could set out to do it. Even to fail hopelessly would be Great. Sometimes ..."

She hesitated. He looked expectation. "I think sometimes it is greater even to fail than to
succeed."

"I don't see that," said the proposed Luther, and his eyes went back to the Moses. She was
about to speak, and changed her mind.

Contemplative pause.

"And then, when a great number of people have heard of your views?" she said presently.

"Then I suppose we must form a party and ... bring things about."

Another pause--full, no doubt, of elevated thoughts.

"I say," said Lewisham quite suddenly. "You do put--well--courage into a chap. I shouldn't
have done that Socialism paper if it hadn't been for you." He turned round and stood leaning
with his back to the Moses, and smiling at her. "You do help a fellow," he said.

That was one of the vivid moments of Miss Heydinger's life. She changed colour a little. "Do
I?" she said, standing straight and awkward and looking into his face, "I'm ... glad."

"I haven't thanked you for your letters," said Lewisham, "And I've been thinking ..."

"Yes?"

"We're first-rate friends, aren't we? The best of friends."

She held out her hand and drew a breath. "Yes," she said as they gripped. He hesitated whether
to hold her hand. He looked into her eyes, and at that moment she would have given three-quarters
of the years she had still to live, to have had eyes and features that could have expressed
her. Instead, she felt her face hard, the little muscles of her mouth twitching insubordinate,
and fancied that her self-consciousness made her eyes dishonest.

"What I mean," said Lewisham, "is--that this will go on. We're always going to be friends,
side by side."

"Always. Just as I am able to help you--I will help you. However I can help you, I will."

"We two," said Lewisham, gripping her hand.

Her face lit. Her eyes were for a moment touched with the beauty of simple emotion. "We two,"
she said, and her lips trembled and her throat seemed to swell. She snatched her hand back
suddenly and turned her face away. Abruptly she walked towards the end of the gallery, and
he saw her fumbling for her handkerchief in the folds of the green and black dress.

She was going to cry!

It set Lewisham marvelling--this totally inappropriate emotion.

He followed her and stood by her. Why cry? He hoped no one would come into the little gallery
until her handkerchief was put away. Nevertheless he felt vaguely flattered. She controlled
herself, dashed her tears away, and smiled bravely at him with reddened eyes. "I'm sorry,"
she said, gulping.

"I am so glad," she explained.

"But we will fight together. We two. I can help you. I know I can help you. And there is such
Work to be done in the world!"

"You are very good to help me," said Lewisham, quoting a phrase from what he had intended to
say before he found out that he had a hold upon her emotions.

"No!

"Has it ever occurred to you," she said abruptly, "how little a woman can do alone in the world?"

"Or a man," he answered after a momentary meditation.

So it was Lewisham enrolled his first ally in the cause of the red tie--of the red tie and
of the Greatness that was presently to come. His first ally; for hitherto--save for the indiscretion
of his mural inscriptions--he had made a secret of his private ambitions. In that now half-forgotten
love affair at Whortley even, he had, in spite of the considerable degree of intimacy attained,
said absolutely nothing about his Career.

CHAPTER XI.

MANIFESTATIONS.

Miss Heydinger declined to disbelieve in the spirits of the dead, and this led to controversy
in the laboratory over Tea. For the girl students, being in a majority that year, had organised
Tea between four o'clock and the advent of the extinguishing policeman at five. And the men
students were occasionally invited to Tea. But not more than two of them at a time really participated,
because there were only two spare cups after that confounded Simmons broke the third.

 But the chances are ... I would rejoice infinitely ..."

So it came about that Lewisham consented to witness a spirit-raising. Miss Heydinger it was
arranged should be there, and the sceptic Smithers, Lagune, his typewriter and the medium would
complete the party. Afterwards there was to be another party for the others. Lewisham was glad
he had the moral support of Smithers. "It's an evening wasted," said Smithers, who had gallantly
resolved to make the running for Lewisham in the contest for the Forbes medal. "But I'll prove
my case. You see if I don't." They were given an address in Chelsea.

The house, when Lewisham found it at last, proved a large one, with such an air of mellowed
dignity that he was abashed. He hung his hat up for himself beside a green-trimmed hat of straw
in the wide, rich-toned hall. Through an open door he had a glimpse of a palatial study, book
shelves bearing white busts, a huge writing-table lit by a green-shaded electric lamp and covered
thickly with papers. The housemaid looked, he thought, with infinite disdain at the rusty mourning
and flamboyant tie, and flounced about and led him upstairs.

She rapped, and there was a discussion within. "They're at it already, I believe," she said
to Lewisham confidentially. "Mr. Lagune's always at it."

There were sounds of chairs being moved, Smithers' extensive voice making a suggestion and
laughing nervously. Lagune appeared opening the door. His grizzled face seemed smaller and
his big grey eyes larger than usual.

"We were just going to begin without you," he whispered. "Come along."

The room was furnished even more finely than the drawing-room of the Whortley Grammar School,
hitherto the finest room (except certain of the State Apartments at Windsor) known to Lewisham.
The furniture struck him in a general way as akin to that in the South Kensington Museum. His
first impression was an appreciation of the vast social superiority of the chairs; it seemed
impertinent to think of sitting on anything quite so quietly stately. He perceived Smithers
standing with an air of bashful hostility against a bookcase. Then he was aware that Lagune
was asking them all to sit down. Already seated at the table was the Medium, Chaffery, a benevolent-looking,
faintly shabby gentleman with bushy iron-grey side-whiskers, a wide, thin-lipped mouth tucked
in at the corners, and a chin like the toe of a boot. He regarded Lewisham critically and disconcertingly
over gilt glasses. Miss Heydinger was quite at her ease and began talking at once. Lewisham's
replies were less confident than they had been in the Gallery of Old Iron; indeed there was
almost a reversal of their positions. She led and he was abashed. He felt obscurely that she
had taken an advantage of him. He became aware of another girlish figure in a dark dress on
his right.

Everyone moved towards the round table in the centre of the room, on which lay a tambourine
and a little green box. Lagune developed unsuspected lengths of knobby wrist and finger directing
his guests to their seats. Lewisham was to sit next to him, between him and the Medium; beyond
the Medium sat Smithers with Miss Heydinger on the other side of him, linked to Lagune by the
typewriter. So sceptics compassed the Medium about. The company was already seated before Lewisham
looked across Lagune and met the eyes of the girl next that gentleman. It was Ethel! The close
green dress, the absence of a hat, and a certain loss of colour made her seem less familiar,
but did not prevent the instant recognition. And there was recognition in her eyes.

Immediately she looked away. At first his only emotion was surprise. He would have spoken,
but a little thing robbed him of speech. For a moment he was unable to remember her surname.
Moreover, the strangeness of his surroundings made him undecided. He did not know what was
the proper way to address her--and he still kept to the superstition of etiquette. Besides--to
speak to her would involve a general explanation to all these people ...

"Just leave a pin-point of gas, Mr. Smithers, please," said Lagune, and suddenly the one surviving
jet of the gas chandelier was turned down and they were in darkness. The moment for recognition
had passed.

The joining of hands was punctiliously verified, the circle was linked little finger to little
finger. Lewisham's abstraction received a rebuke from Smithers. The Medium, speaking in an
affable voice, premised that he could promise nothing, he had no "directing" power over manifestations.
Thereafter ensued a silence....

For a space Lewisham was inattentive to all that happened.

He sat in the breathing darkness, staring at the dim elusive shape that had presented that
remembered face. His mind was astonishment mingled with annoyance. He had settled that this
girl was lost to him for ever. The spell of the old days of longing, of the afternoons that
he had spent after his arrival in London, wandering through Clapham with a fading hope of meeting
her, had not returned to him. But he was ashamed of his stupid silence, and irritated by the
awkwardness of the situation. At one moment he was on the very verge of breaking the compact
and saying "Miss Henderson" across the table....

How was it he had forgotten that "Henderson"? He was still young enough to be surprised at
forgetfulness.

Smithers coughed, one might imagine with a warning intention.

Lewisham, recalling his detective responsibility with an effort, peered about him, but the
room was very dark. The silence was broken ever and again by deep sighs and a restless stirring
from the Medium. Out of this mental confusion Lewisham's personal vanity was first to emerge.
What did she think of him? Was she peering at him through the darkness even as he peered at
her? Should he pretend to see her for the first time when the lights were restored? As the
minutes lengthened it seemed as though the silence grew deeper and deeper. There was no fire
in the room, and it looked, for lack of that glow, chilly. A curious scepticism arose in his
mind as to whether he had actually seen Ethel or only mistaken someone else for her. He wanted
the séance over in order that he might look at her again. The old days at Whortley came out
of his memory with astonishing detail and yet astonishingly free from emotion....

He became aware of a peculiar sensation down his back, that he tried to account for as a draught....

Suddenly a beam of cold air came like a touch against his face, and made him shudder convulsively.
Then he hoped that she had not marked his shudder. He thought of laughing a low laugh to show
he was not afraid. Someone else shuddered too, and he perceived an extraordinarily vivid odour
of violets. Lagune's finger communicated a nervous quivering.

What was happening?

The musical box somewhere on the table began playing a rather trivial, rather plaintive air
that was strange to him. It seemed to deepen the silence about him, an accent on the expectant
stillness, a thread of tinkling melody spanning an abyss.

Lewisham took himself in hand at this stage. What was happening? He must attend. Was he really
watching as he should do? He had been wool-gathering. There were no such things as spirits,
mediums were humbugs, and he was here to prove that sole remaining Gospel. But he must keep
up with things--he was missing points. What was that scent of violets? And who had set the
musical box going? The Medium, of course; but how? He tried to recall whether he had heard
a rustling or detected any movement before the music began. He could not recollect. Come! he
must be more on the alert than this!

He became acutely desirous of a successful exposure. He figured the dramatic moment he had
prepared with Smithers--Ethel a spectator. He peered suspiciously into the darkness.

Somebody shuddered again, someone opposite him this time. He felt Lagune's finger quiver still
more palpably, and then suddenly the raps began, abruptly, all about him. Rap!--making him
start violently. A swift percussive sound, tap, rap, dap, under the table, under the chair,
in the air, round the cornices. The Medium groaned again and shuddered, and his nervous agitation
passed sympathetically round the circle. The music seemed to fade to the vanishing point and
grew louder again.

How was it done?

He heard Lagune's voice next him speaking with a peculiar quality of breathless reverence,
"The alphabet?" he asked, "shall we--shall we use the alphabet?"

A forcible rap under the table.

"No!" interpreted the voice of the Medium.

The raps were continued everywhere.

Of course it was trickery, Lewisham endeavoured to think what the mechanism was. He tried to
determine whether he really had the Medium's little finger touching his. He peered at the dark
shape next him. There was a violent rapping far away behind them with an almost metallic resonance.
Then the raps ceased, and over the healing silence the little jet of melody from the musical
box played alone. And after a moment that ceased also....

The stillness was profound, Mr. Lewisham was now highly strung. Doubts assailed him suddenly,
and an overwhelming apprehension, a sense of vast occurrences gathering above him. The darkness
was a physical oppression....

He started. Something had stirred on the table. There was the sharp ping of metal being struck.
A number of little crepitating sounds like paper being smoothed. The sound of wind without
the movement of air. A sense of a presence hovering over the table.

The excitement of Lagune communicated itself in convulsive tremblings; the Medium's hand quivered.
In the darkness on the table something faintly luminous, a greenish-white patch, stirred and
hopped slowly among the dim shapes.

The object, whatever it was, hopped higher, rose slowly in the air, expanded. Lewisham's attention
followed this slavishly. It was ghostly--unaccountable--marvellous. For the moment he forgot
even Ethel. Higher and higher this pallid luminosity rose overhead, and then he saw that it
was a ghostly hand and arm, rising, rising. Slowly, deliberately it crossed the table, seemed
to touch Lagune, who shivered. It moved slowly round and touched Lewisham. He gritted his teeth.

There was no mistaking the touch, firm and yet soft, of finger-tips. Almost simultaneously,
Miss Heydinger cried out that something was smoothing her hair, and suddenly the musical box
set off again with a reel. The faint oval of the tambourine rose, jangled, and Lewisham heard
it pat Smithers in the face. It seemed to pass overhead. Immediately a table somewhere beyond
the Medium began moving audibly on its castors.

It seemed impossible that the Medium, sitting so still beside him, could be doing all these
things--grotesquely unmeaning though they might be. After all....

The ghostly hand was hovering almost directly in front of Mr. Lewisham's eyes. It hung with
a slight quivering. Ever and again its fingers flapped down and rose stiffly again.

Noise! A loud noise it seemed. Something moving? What was it he had to do?

Lewisham suddenly missed the Medium's little finger. He tried to recover it. He could not find
it. He caught, held and lost an arm. There was an exclamation. A faint report. A curse close
to him bitten in half by the quick effort to suppress it. Tzit! The little pinpoint of light
flew up with a hiss.

Lewisham, standing, saw a circle of blinking faces turned to the group of two this sizzling
light revealed. Smithers was the chief figure of the group; he stood triumphant, one hand on
the gas tap, the other gripping the Medium's wrist, and in the Medium's hand--the incriminatory
tambourine.

"How's this, Lewisham?" cried Smithers, with the shadows on his face jumping as the gas flared.

"Caught!" said Lewisham loudly, rising in his place and avoiding Ethel's eyes.

"What's this?" cried the Medium.

"Cheating," panted Smithers.

"Not so," cried the Medium. "When you turned up the light ... put my hand up ... caught tambourine
... to save head."

"Mr. Smithers," cried Lagune. "Mr. Smithers, this is very wrong. This--shock--"

The tambourine fell noisily to the floor. The Medium's face changed, he groaned strangely and
staggered back. Lagune cried out for a glass of water. Everyone looked at the man, expecting
him to fall, save Lewisham. The thought of Ethel had flashed back into his mind. He turned
to see how she took this exposure in which he was such a prominent actor. He saw her leaning
over the table as if to pick up something that lay across it. She was not looking at him, she
was looking at the Medium. Her face was set and white. Then, as if she felt his glance, her
eyes met his.

She started back, stood erect, facing him with a strange hardness in her eyes.

In the moment Lewisham did not grasp the situation. He wanted to show that he was acting upon
equal terms with Smithers in the exposure. For the moment her action simply directed his attention
to the object towards which she had been leaning, a thing of shrivelled membrane, a pneumatic
glove, lying on the table. This was evidently part of the mediumistic apparatus. He pounced
and seized it.

"Look!" he said, holding it towards Smithers. "Here is more! What is this?"

He perceived that the girl started. He saw Chaffery, the Medium, look instantly over Smithers'
shoulders, saw his swift glance of reproach at the girl. Abruptly the situation appeared to
Lewisham; he perceived her complicity. And he stood, still in the attitude of triumph, with
the evidence against her in his hand! But his triumph had vanished.

"Ah!" cried Smithers, leaning across the table to secure it. "Good old Lewisham!... Now we
have it. This is better than the tambourine."

His eyes shone with triumph. "Do you see, Mr. Lagune?" said Smithers. "The Medium held this
in his teeth and blew it out. There's no denying this. This wasn't falling on your head, Mr.
Medium, was it? This--this was the luminous hand!"

CHAPTER XII.

LEWISHAM IS UNACCOUNTABLE.

That night, as she went with him to Chelsea station, Miss Heydinger discovered an extraordinary
moodiness in Lewisham. She had been vividly impressed by the scene in which they had just participated,
she had for a time believed in the manifestations; the swift exposure had violently revolutionised
her ideas. The details of the crisis were a little confused in her mind. She ranked Lewisham
with Smithers in the scientific triumph of the evening. On the whole she felt elated. She had
no objection to being confuted by Lewisham. But she was angry with the Medium, "It is dreadful,"
she said. "Living a lie! How can the world grow better, when sane, educated people use their
sanity and enlightenment to darken others? It is dreadful!

"He was a horrible man--such an oily, dishonest voice. And the girl--I was sorry for her. She
must have been oh!--bitterly ashamed, or why should she have burst out crying? That did distress
me. Fancy crying like that! It was--yes--abandon. But what can one do?"

She paused. Lewisham was walking along, looking straight before him, lost in some grim argument
with himself.

"It makes me think of Sludge the Medium," she said.

He made no answer.

She glanced at him suddenly. "Have you read Sludge the Medium?"

"Eigh?" he said, coming back out of infinity. "What? I beg your pardon. Sludge, the Medium?
I thought his name was--it was--Chaffery."

He looked at her, clearly very anxious upon this question of fact.

"But I mean Browning's 'Sludge.' You know the poem."

"No--I'm afraid I don't," said Lewisham.

"I must lend it to you," she said. "It's splendid. It goes to the very bottom of this business."

"Does it?"

"It never occurred to me before. But I see the point clearly now. If people, poor people, are
offered money if phenomena happen, it's too much. They are bound to cheat. It's bribery--immorality!"

She talked in panting little sentences, because Lewisham was walking in heedless big strides.
"I wonder how much--such people--could earn honestly."

Lewisham slowly became aware of the question at his ear. He hurried back from infinity. "How
much they could earn honestly? I haven't the slightest idea."

He paused. "The whole of this business puzzles me," he said. "I want to think."

"It's frightfully complex, isn't it?" she said--a little staggered.

But the rest of the way to the station was silence. They parted with a hand-clasp they took
a pride in--a little perfunctory so far as Lewisham was concerned on this occasion. She scrutinised
his face as the train moved out of the station, and tried to account for his mood. He was staring
before him at unknown things as if he had already forgotten her.

He wanted to think! But two heads, she thought, were better than one in a matter of opinion.
It troubled her to be so ignorant of his mental states. "How we are wrapped and swathed about--soul
from soul!" she thought, staring out of the window at the dim things flying by outside.

Suddenly a fit of depression came upon her. She felt alone--absolutely alone--in a void world.

Presently she returned to external things. She became aware of two people in the next compartment
eyeing her critically. Her hand went patting at her hair.

CHAPTER XIII.

LEWISHAM INSISTS.

Ethel Henderson sat at her machine before the window of Mr. Lagume's study, and stared blankly
at the greys and blues of the November twilight. Her face was white, her eyelids were red from
recent weeping, and her hands lay motionless in her lap. The door had just slammed behind Lagune.

"Heigh-ho!" she said. "I wish I was dead. Oh! I wish I was out of it all."

She became passive again. "I wonder what I have done," she said, "that I should be punished
like this."

She certainly looked anything but a Fate-haunted soul, being indeed visibly and immediately
a very pretty girl. Her head was shapely and covered with curly dark hair, and the eyebrows
above her hazel eyes were clear and dark. Her lips were finely shaped, her mouth was not too
small to be expressive, her chin small, and her neck white and full and pretty. There is no
need to lay stress upon her nose--it sufficed. She was of a mediocre height, sturdy rather
than slender, and her dress was of a pleasant, golden-brown material with the easy sleeves
and graceful line of those aesthetic days. And she sat at her typewriter and wished she was
dead and wondered what she had done.

The room was lined with bookshelves, and conspicuous therein were a long row of foolish pretentious
volumes, the "works" of Lagune--the witless, meandering imitation of philosophy that occupied
his life. Along the cornices were busts of Plato, Socrates, and Newton. Behind Ethel was the
great man's desk with its green-shaded electric light, and littered with proofs and copies
of Hesperus, "A Paper for Doubters," which, with her assistance, he edited, published, compiled,
wrote, and (without her help) paid for and read. A pen, flung down forcibly, quivered erect
with its one surviving nib in the blotting pad. Mr. Lagune had flung it down.

The collapse of the previous night had distressed him dreadfully, and ever and again before
his retreat he had been breaking into passionate monologue. The ruin of a life-work, it was,
no less. Surely she had known that Chaffery was a cheat. Had she not known? Silence. "After
so many kindnesses--"

She interrupted him with a wailing, "Oh, I know--I know."

But Lagune was remorseless and insisted she had betrayed him, worse--made him ridiculous! Look
at the "work" he had undertaken at South Kensington--how could he go on with that now? How
could he find the heart? When his own typewriter sacrificed him to her stepfather's trickery?
"Trickery!"

The gesticulating hands became active, the grey eyes dilated with indignation, the piping voice
eloquent.

"If he hadn't cheated you, someone else would," was Ethel's inadequate muttered retort, unheard
by the seeker after phenomena.

It was perhaps not so bad as dismissal, but it certainly lasted longer. And at home was Chaffery,
grimly malignant at her failure to secure that pneumatic glove. He had no right to blame her,
he really had not; but a disturbed temper is apt to falsify the scales of justice. The tambourine,
he insisted, he could have explained by saying he put up his hand to catch it and protect his
head directly Smithers moved. But the pneumatic glove there was no explaining. He had made
a chance for her to secure it when he had pretended to faint. It was rubbish to say anyone
could have been looking on the table then--rubbish.

Beside that significant wreck of a pen stood a little carriage clock in a case, and this suddenly
lifted a slender voice and announced five. She turned round on her stool and sat staring at
the clock. She smiled with the corners of her mouth down. "Home," she said, "and begin again.
It's like battledore and shuttlecock....

"I was silly....

"I suppose I've brought it on myself. I ought to have picked it up, I suppose. I had time....

"Cheats ... just cheats.

"I never thought I should see him again....

"He was ashamed, of course.... He had his own friends."

For a space she sat still, staring blankly before her. She sighed, rubbed a knuckle in a reddened
eye, rose.

She went into the hall, where her hat, transfixed by a couple of hat-pins, hung above her jacket,
assumed these garments, and let herself out into the cold grey street.

She had hardly gone twenty yards from Lagune's door before she became aware of a man overtaking
her and walking beside her. That kind of thing is a common enough experience to girls who go
to and from work in London, and she had had perforce to learn many things since her adventurous
Whortley days. She looked stiffly in front of her. The man deliberately got in her way so that
she had to stop. She lifted eyes of indignant protest. It was Lewisham--and his face was white.

He hesitated awkwardly, and then in silence held out his hand. She took it mechanically. He
found his voice. "Miss Henderson," he said.

"What do you want?" she asked faintly.

"I don't know," he said.... "I want to talk to you."

"Yes?" Her heart was beating fast.

He found the thing unexpectedly difficult.

"May I--? Are you expecting--? Have you far to go? I would like to talk to you. There is a lot ..."

"I walk to Clapham," she said. "If you care ... to come part of the way ..."

She moved awkwardly. Lewisham took his place at her side. They walked side by side for a moment,
their manner constrained, having so much to say that they could not find a word to begin upon.

"Have you forgotten Whortley?" he asked abruptly.

"No."

He glanced at her; her face was downcast. "Why did you never write?" he asked bitterly.

"I wrote."

"Again, I mean."

"I did--in July."

"I never had it."

"It came back."

"But Mrs. Munday ..."

"I had forgotten her name. I sent it to the Grammar School."

Lewisham suppressed an exclamation.

"I am very sorry," she said.

They went on again in silence. "Last night," said Lewisham at length. "I have no business to
ask. But--"

She took a long breath. "Mr. Lewisham," she said. "That man you saw--the Medium--was my stepfather."

"Well?"

"Isn't that enough?"

Lewisham paused. "No," he said.

There was another constrained silence. "No," he said less dubiously. "I don't care a rap what
your stepfather is. Were you cheating?"

Her face turned white. Her mouth opened and closed. "Mr. Lewisham," she said deliberately,
"you may not believe it, it may sound impossible, but on my honour ... I did not know--I did
not know for certain, that is--that my stepfather ..."

"Ah!" said Lewisham, leaping at conviction. "Then I was right...."

For a moment she stared at him, and then, "I did know," she said, suddenly beginning to cry.
"How can I tell you? It is a lie. I did know. I did know all the time."

He stared at her in white astonishment. He fell behind her one step, and then in a stride came
level again. Then, a silence, a silence that seemed it would never end. She had stopped crying,
she was one huge suspense, not daring even to look at his face. And at last he spoke.

"No," he said slowly. "I don't mind even that. I don't care--even if it was that."

Abruptly they turned into the King's Road, with its roar of wheeled traffic and hurrying foot-passengers,
and forthwith a crowd of boys with a broken-spirited Guy involved and separated them. In a
busy highway of a night one must needs talk disconnectedly in shouted snatches or else hold
one's peace. He glanced at her face and saw that it was set again. Presently she turned southward
out of the tumult into a street of darkness and warm blinds, and they could go on talking again.

"I understand what you mean," said Lewisham. "I know I do. You knew, but you did not want to
know. It was like that."

But her mind had been active. "At the end of this road," she said, gulping a sob, "you must
go back. It was kind of you to come, Mr. Lewisham. But you were ashamed--you are sure to be
ashamed. My employer is a spiritualist, and my stepfather is a professional Medium, and my
mother is a spiritualist. You were quite right not to speak to me last night. Quite. It was
kind of you to come, but you must go back. Life is hard enough as it is ... You must go back
at the end of the road. Go back at the end of the road ..."

Lewisham made no reply for a hundred yards. "I'm coming on to Clapham," he said.

They came to the end of the road in silence. Then at the kerb corner she turned and faced him.
"Go back," she whispered.

"No," he said obstinately, and they stood face to face at the cardinal point of their lives.

"Listen to me," said Lewisham. "It is hard to say what I feel. I don't know myself.... But
I'm not going to lose you like this. I'm not going to let you slip a second time. I was awake
about it all last night. I don't care where you are, what your people are, nor very much whether
you've kept quite clear of this medium humbug. I don't. You will in future. Anyhow. I've had
a day and night to think it over. I had to come and try to find you. It's you. I've never forgotten
you. Never. I'm not going to be sent back like this."

"It can be no good for either of us," she said as resolute as he.

"I shan't leave you."

"But what is the good?..."

"I'm coming," said Lewisham, dogmatically.

And he came.

He asked her a question point blank and she would not answer him, and for some way they walked
in grim silence. Presently she spoke with a twitching mouth. "I wish you would leave me," she
said. "You are quite different from what I am. You felt that last night. You helped find us
out...."

"When first I came to London I used to wander about Clapham looking for you," said Lewisham,
"week after week."

They had crossed the bridge and were in a narrow little street of shabby shops near Clapham
Junction before they talked again. She kept her face averted and expressionless.

"I'm sorry," said Lewisham, with a sort of stiff civility, "if I seem to be forcing myself
upon you. I don't want to pry into your affairs--if you don't wish me to. The sight of you
has somehow brought back a lot of things.... I can't explain it. Perhaps--I had to come to
find you--I kept on thinking of your face, of how you used to smile, how you jumped from the
gate by the lock, and how we had tea ... a lot of things."

He stopped again.

"A lot of things."

"If I may come," he said, and went unanswered. They crossed the wide streets by the Junction
and went on towards the Common.

"I live down this road," she said, stopping abruptly at a corner. "I would rather ..."

"But I have said nothing."

She looked at him with her face white, unable to speak for a space. "It can do no good," she
said. "I am mixed up with this...."

She stopped.

He spoke deliberately. "I shall come," he said, "to-morrow night."

"No," she said.

"But I shall come."

"No," she whispered.

"I shall come." She could hide the gladness of her heart from herself no longer. She was frightened
that he had come, but she was glad, and she knew he knew that she was glad. She made no further
protest. She held out her hand dumbly. And on the morrow she found him awaiting her even as
he had said.

CHAPTER XIV.

MR. LAGUNE'S POINT OF VIEW.

For three days the Laboratory at South Kensington saw nothing of Lagune, and then he came back
more invincibly voluble than ever. Everyone had expected him to return apostate, but he brought
back an invigorated faith, a propaganda unashamed. From some source he had derived strength
and conviction afresh. Even the rhetorical Smithers availed nothing. There was a joined battle
over the insufficient tea-cups, and the elderly young assistant demonstrator hovered on the
verge of the discussion, rejoicing, it is supposed, over the entanglements of Smithers. For
at the outset Smithers displayed an overweening confidence and civility, and at the end his
ears were red and his finer manners lost to him.

Lewisham, it was remarked by Miss Heydinger, made but a poor figure in this discussion. Once
or twice he seemed about to address Lagune, and thought better of it with the words upon his lips.

Lagune's treatment of the exposure was light and vigorous. "The man Chaffery," he said, "has
made a clean breast of it. His point of view--"

"Facts are facts," said Smithers.

"A fact is a synthesis of impressions," said Lagune; "but that you will learn when you are
older. The thing is that we were at cross purposes. I told Chaffery you were beginners. He
treated you as beginners--arranged a demonstration."

"It was a demonstration," said Smithers.

"Precisely. If it had not been for your interruptions ..."

"Ah!"

"He forged elementary effects ..."

"You can't but admit that."

"I don't attempt to deny it. But, as he explained, the thing is necessary--justifiable. Psychic
phenomena are subtle, a certain training of the observation is necessary. A medium is a more
subtle instrument than a balance or a borax bead, and see how long it is before you can get
assured results with a borax bead! In the elementary class, in the introductory phase, conditions
are too crude...."

"For honesty."

"Wait a moment. Is it dishonest--rigging a demonstration?"

"Of course it is."

"Your professors do it."

"I deny that in toto," said Smithers, and repeated with satisfaction, "in toto."

"That's all right," said Lagune, "because I have the facts. Your chemical lecturers--you may
go downstairs now and ask, if you disbelieve me--always cheat over the indestructibility of
matter experiment--always. And then another--a physiography thing. You know the experiment
I mean? To demonstrate the existence of the earth's rotation. They use--they use--"

"Foucault's pendulum," said Lewisham. "They use a rubber ball with a pin-hole hidden in the
hand, and blow the pendulum round the way it ought to go."

"But that's different," said Smithers.

"Wait a moment," said Lagune, and produced a piece of folded printed paper from his pocket.
"Here is a review from Nature of the work of no less a person than Professor Greenhill. And
see--a convenient pin is introduced in the apparatus for the demonstration of virtual velocities!
Read it--if you doubt me. I suppose you doubt me."

Smithers abruptly abandoned his position of denial "in toto." "This isn't my point, Mr. Lagune;
this isn't my point," he said. "These things that are done in the lecture theatre are not to
prove facts, but to give ideas."

"So was my demonstration," said Lagune.

"We didn't understand it in that light."

"Nor does the ordinary person who goes to Science lectures understand it in that light. He
is comforted by the thought that he is seeing things with his own eyes."

"Well, I don't care," said Smithers; "two wrongs don't make a right. To rig demonstrations
is wrong."

"There I agree with you. I have spoken plainly with this man Chaffery. He's not a full-blown
professor, you know, a highly salaried ornament of the rock of truth like your demonstration-rigging
professors here, and so I can speak plainly to him without offence. He takes quite the view
they would take. But I am more rigorous. I insist that there shall be no more of this...."

"Next time--" said Smithers with irony.

"There will be no next time. I have done with elementary exhibitions. You must take the word
of the trained observer--just as you do in the matter of chemical analysis."

"Do you mean you are going on with that chap when he's been caught cheating under your very nose?"

"Certainly. Why not?"

Smithers set out to explain why not, and happened on confusion. "I still believe the man has
powers," said Lagune.

"Of deception," said Smithers.

"Those I must eliminate," said Lagune. "You might as well refuse to study electricity because
it escaped through your body. All new science is elusive. No investigator in his senses would
refuse to investigate a compound because it did unexpected things. Either this dissolves in
acid or I have nothing more to do with it--eh? That's fine research!"

Then it was the last vestiges of Smithers' manners vanished. "I don't care what you say," said
Smithers. "It's all rot--it's all just rot. Argue if you like--but have you convinced anybody?
Put it to the vote."

"That's democracy with a vengeance," said Lagune. "A general election of the truth half-yearly,
eh?"

"That's simply wriggling out of it," said Smithers. "That hasn't anything to do with it at all."

Lagune, flushed but cheerful, was on his way downstairs when Lewisham overtook him. He was
pale and out of breath, but as the staircase invariably rendered Lagune breathless he did not
remark the younger man's disturbance. "Interesting talk," panted Lewisham. "Very interesting
talk, sir."

"I'm glad you found it so--very," said Lagune.

There was a pause, and then Lewisham plunged desperately. "There is a young lady--she is your
typewriter...."

He stopped from sheer loss of breath.

"Yes?" said Lagune.

"Is she a medium or anything of that sort?"

"Well," Lagune reflected, "She is not a medium, certainly. But--why do you ask?"

"Oh!... I wondered."

"You noticed her eyes perhaps. She is the stepdaughter of that man Chaffery--a queer character,
but indisputably mediumistic. It's odd the thing should have struck you. Curiously enough I
myself have fancied she might be something of a psychic--judging from her face."

"A what?"

"A psychic--undeveloped, of course. I have thought once or twice. Only a little while ago I
was speaking to that man Chaffery about her."

"Were you?"

"Yes. He of course would like to see any latent powers developed. But it's a little difficult
to begin, you know."

"You mean--she won't?"

"Not at present. She is a good girl, but in this matter she is--timid. There is often a sort
of disinclination--a queer sort of feeling--one might almost call it modesty."

"I see," said Lewisham.

"One can override it usually. I don't despair."

"No," said Lewisham shortly. They were at the foot of the staircase now. He hesitated. "You've
given me a lot to think about," he said with an attempt at an off-hand manner. "The way you
talked upstairs;" and turned towards the book he had to sign.

"I'm glad you don't take up quite such an intolerant attitude as Mr. Smithers," said Lagune;
"very glad. I must lend you a book or two. If your cramming here leaves you any time, that is."

"Thanks," said Lewisham shortly, and walked away from him. The studiously characteristic signature
quivered and sprawled in an unfamiliar manner.

"I'm damned if he overrides it," said Lewisham, under his breath.

CHAPTER XV.

LOVE IN THE STREETS.

Lewisham was not quite clear what course he meant to take in the high enterprise of foiling
Lagune, and indeed he was anything but clear about the entire situation. His logical processes,
his emotions and his imagination seemed playing some sort of snatching game with his will.
Enormous things hung imminent, but it worked out to this, that he walked home with Ethel night
after night for--to be exact--seven-and-sixty nights. Every week night through November and
December, save once, when he had to go into the far East to buy himself an overcoat, he was
waiting to walk with her home. A curious, inconclusive affair, that walk, to which he came
nightly full of vague longings, and which ended invariably under an odd shadow of disappointment.
It began outside Lagune's most punctually at five, and ended--mysteriously--at the corner of
a side road in Clapham, a road of little yellow houses with sunk basements and tawdry decorations
of stone. Up that road she vanished night after night, into a grey mist and the shadow beyond
a feeble yellow gas-lamp, and he would watch her vanish, and then sigh and turn back towards
his lodgings.

They talked of this and that, their little superficial ideas about themselves, and of their
circumstances and tastes, and always there was something, something that was with them unspoken,
unacknowledged, which made all these things unreal and insincere.

Yet out of their talk he began to form vague ideas of the home from which she came. There was,
of course, no servant, and the mother was something meandering, furtive, tearful in the face
of troubles. Sometimes of an afternoon or evening she grew garrulous. "Mother does talk so--sometimes."
She rarely went out of doors. Chaffery always rose late, and would sometimes go away for days
together. He was mean; he allowed only a weekly twenty-five shillings for housekeeping, and
sometimes things grew unsatisfactory at the week-end. There seemed to be little sympathy between
mother and daughter; the widow had been flighty in a dingy fashion, and her marriage with her
chief lodger Chaffery had led to unforgettable sayings. It was to facilitate this marriage
that Ethel had been sent to Whortley, so that was counted a mitigated evil. But these were
far-off things, remote and unreal down the long, ill-lit vista of the suburban street which
swallowed up Ethel nightly. The walk, her warmth and light and motion close to him, her clear
little voice, and the touch of her hand; that was reality.

The shadow of Chaffery and his deceptions lay indeed across all these things, sometimes faint,
sometimes dark and present. Then Lewisham became insistent, his sentimental memories ceased,
and he asked questions that verged on gulfs of doubt. Had she ever "helped"? She had not, she
declared. Then she added that twice at home she had "sat down" to complete the circle. She
would never help again. That she promised--if it needed promising. There had already been dreadful
trouble at home about the exposure at Lagune's. Her mother had sided with her stepfather and
joined in blaming her. But was she to blame?

"Of course you were not to blame," said Lewisham. Lagune, he learnt, had been unhappy and restless
for the three days after the séance--indulging in wearisome monologue--with Ethel as sole auditor
(at twenty-one shillings a week). Then he had decided to give Chaffery a sound lecture on his
disastrous dishonesty. But it was Chaffery gave the lecture. Smithers, had he only known it,
had been overthrown by a better brain than Lagune's, albeit it spoke through Lagune's treble.

Ethel did not like talking of Chaffery and these other things. "If you knew how sweet it was
to forget it all," she would say; "to be just us two together for a little while." And, "What
good does it do to keep on?" when Lewisham was pressing. Lewisham wanted very much to keep
on at times, but the good of it was a little hard to demonstrate. So his knowledge of the situation
remained imperfect and the weeks drifted by.

Wonderfully varied were those seven-and-sixty nights, as he came to remember in after life.
There were nights of damp and drizzle, and then thick fogs, beautiful, isolating, grey-white
veils, turning every yard of pavement into a private room. Grand indeed were these fogs, things
to rejoice at mightily, since then it was no longer a thing for public scorn when two young
people hurried along arm in arm, and one could do a thousand impudent, significant things with
varying pressure and the fondling of a little hand (a hand in a greatly mended glove of cheap
kid). Then indeed one seemed to be nearer that elusive something that threaded it all together.
And the dangers of the street corners, the horses looming up suddenly out of the dark, the
carters with lanterns at their horses' heads, the street lamps, blurred, smoky orange at one's
nearest, and vanishing at twenty yards into dim haze, seemed to accentuate the infinite need
of protection on the part of a delicate young lady who had already traversed three winters
of fogs, thornily alone. Moreover, one could come right down the quiet street where she lived,
halfway to the steps of her house, with a delightful sense of enterprise.

The fogs passed all too soon into a hard frost, into nights of starlight and presently moonlight,
when the lamps looked hard, flashing like rows of yellow gems, and their reflections and the
glare of the shop windows were sharp and frosty, and even the stars hard and bright, snapping
noiselessly (if one may say so) instead of twinkling. A jacket trimmed with imitation Astrachan
replaced Ethel's lighter coat, and a round cap of Astrachan her hat, and her eyes shone hard
and bright, and her forehead was broad and white beneath it. It was exhilarating, but one got
home too soon, and so the way from Chelsea to Clapham was lengthened, first into a loop of
side streets, and then when the first pulverulent snows told that Christmas was at hand, into
a new loop down King's Road, and once even through the Brompton Road and Sloane Street, where
the shops were full of decorations and entertaining things.

And, under circumstances of infinite gravity, Mr. Lewisham secretly spent three-and-twenty
shillings out of the vestiges of that hundred pounds, and bought Ethel a little gold ring set
with pearls. With that there must needs be a ceremonial, and on the verge of the snowy, foggy
Common she took off her glove and the ring was placed on her finger. Whereupon he was moved
to kiss her--on the frost-pink knuckle next to an inky nail.

"It's silly of us," she said. "What can we do?--ever?"

"You wait." he said, and his tone was full of vague promises.

Afterwards he thought over those promises, and another evening went into the matter more fully,
telling her of all the brilliant things that he held it was possible for a South Kensington
student to do and be--of headmasterships, northern science schools, inspectorships, demonstratorships,
yea, even professorships. And then, and then--To all of which she lent a willing and incredulous
ear, finding in that dreaming a quality of fear as well as delight.

The putting on of the pearl-set ring was mere ceremonial, of course; she could not wear it
either at Lagune's or at home, so instead she threaded it on a little white satin ribbon and
wore it round her neck--"next her heart." He thought of it there warm "next her heart."

When he had bought the ring he had meant to save it for Christmas before he gave it to her.
But the desire to see her pleasure had been too strong for him.

Christmas Eve, I know not by what deceit on her part, these young people spent together all
day. Lagune was down with a touch of bronchitis and had given his typewriter a holiday. Perhaps
she forgot to mention it at home. The Royal College was in vacation and Lewisham was free.
He declined the plumber's invitation; "work" kept him in London, he said, though it meant a
pound or more of added expenditure. These absurd young people walked sixteen miles that Christmas
Eve, and parted warm and glowing. There had been a hard frost and a little snow, the sky was
a colourless grey, icicles hung from the arms of the street lamps, and the pavements were patterned
out with frond-like forms that were trodden into slides as the day grew older. The Thames they
knew was a wonderful sight, but that they kept until last. They went first along the Brompton
Road....

And it is well that you should have the picture of them right: Lewisham in the ready-made overcoat,
blue cloth and velvet collar, dirty tan gloves, red tie, and bowler hat; and Ethel in a two-year-old
jacket and hat of curly Astrachan; both pink-cheeked from the keen air, shyly arm in arm occasionally,
and very alert to miss no possible spectacle. The shops were varied and interesting along the
Brompton Road, but nothing to compare with Piccadilly. There were windows in Piccadilly so
full of costly little things, it took fifteen minutes to get them done, card shops, drapers'
shops full of foolish, entertaining attractions. Lewisham, in spite of his old animosities,
forgot to be severe on the Shopping Class, Ethel was so vastly entertained by all these pretty
follies.

Then up Regent Street by the place where the sham diamonds are, and the place where the girls
display their long hair, and the place where the little chickens run about in the window, and
so into Oxford Street, Holborn, Ludgate Hill, St. Paul's Churchyard, to Leadenhall, and the
markets where turkeys, geese, ducklings, and chickens--turkeys predominant, however--hang in
rows of a thousand at a time.

"I must buy you something," said Lewisham, resuming a topic.

"No, no," said Ethel, with her eye down a vista of innumerable birds.

"But I must," said Lewisham. "You had better choose it, or I shall get something wrong." His
mind ran on brooches and clasps.

"You mustn't waste your money, and besides, I have that ring."

But Lewisham insisted.

"Then--if you must--I am starving. Buy me something to eat."

An immense and memorable joke. Lewisham plunged recklessly--orientally--into an awe-inspiring
place with mitred napkins. They lunched on cutlets--stripped the cutlets to the bone--and little
crisp brown potatoes, and they drank between them a whole half bottle of--some white wine or
other, Lewisham selected in an off-hand way from the list. Neither of them had ever taken wine
at a meal before. One-and-ninepence it cost him, Sir, and the name of it was Capri! It was
really very passable Capri--a manufactured product, no doubt, but warming and aromatic. Ethel
was aghast at his magnificence and drank a glass and a half.

Then, very warm and comfortable, they went down by the Tower, and the Tower Bridge with its
crest of snow, huge pendant icicles, and the ice blocks choked in its side arches, was seasonable
seeing. And as they had had enough of shops and crowds they set off resolutely along the desolate
Embankment homeward.

But indeed the Thames was a wonderful sight that year! ice-fringed along either shore, and
with drift-ice in the middle reflecting a luminous scarlet from the broad red setting sun,
and moving steadily, incessantly seaward. A swarm of mewing gulls went to and fro, and with
them mingled pigeons and crows. The buildings on the Surrey side were dim and grey and very
mysterious, the moored, ice-blocked barges silent and deserted, and here and there a lit window
shone warm. The sun sank right out of sight into a bank of blue, and the Surrey side dissolved
in mist save for a few insoluble, spots of yellow light, that presently became many. And after
our lovers had come under Charing Cross Bridge the Houses of Parliament rose before them at
the end of a great crescent of golden lamps, blue and faint, halfway between the earth and
sky. And the clock on the Tower was like a November sun.

It was a day without a flaw, or at most but the slightest speck. And that only came at the
very end.

"Good-bye, dear," she said. "I have been very happy to-day."

His face came very close to hers. "Good-bye," he said, pressing her hand and looking into her eyes.

She glanced round, she drew nearer to him. "Dearest one," she whispered very softly, and then,
"Good-bye."

Suddenly he became unaccountably petulant, he dropped her hand. "It's always like this. We
are happy. I am happy. And then--then you are taken away...."

There was a silence of mute interrogations.

"Dear," she whispered, "we must wait."

A moment's pause. "Wait!" he said, and broke off. He hesitated. "Good-bye," he said as though
he was snapping a thread that held them together.

CHAPTER XVI.

MISS HEYDINGER'S PRIVATE THOUGHTS.

The way from Chelsea to Clapham and the way from South Kensington to Battersea, especially
if the former is looped about a little to make it longer, come very near to each other. One
night close upon Christmas two friends of Lewisham's passed him and Ethel. But Lewisham did
not see them, because he was looking at Ethel's face.

"Did you see?" said the other girl, a little maliciously.

"Mr. Lewisham--wasn't it?" said Miss Heydinger in a perfectly indifferent tone.

       *       *       *       *       *

Miss Heydinger sat in the room her younger sisters called her "Sanctum." Her Sanctum was only
too evidently an intellectualised bedroom, and a cheap wallpaper of silvery roses peeped coquettishly
from among her draped furniture. Her particular glories were the writing-desk in the middle
and the microscope on the unsteady octagonal table under the window. There were bookshelves
of workmanship patently feminine in their facile decoration and structural instability, and
on them an array of glittering poets, Shelley, Rossetti, Keats, Browning, and odd volumes of
Ruskin, South Place Sermons, Socialistic publications in torn paper covers, and above, science
text-books and note-books in an oppressive abundance. The autotypes that hung about the room
were eloquent of aesthetic ambitions and of a certain impermeability to implicit meanings.
There were the Mirror of Venus by Burne Jones, Rossetti's Annunciation, Lippi's Annunciation,
and the Love of Life and Love and Death of Watts. And among other photographs was one of last
year's Debating Society Committee, Lewisham smiling a little weakly near the centre, and Miss
Heydinger out of focus in the right wing. And Miss Heydinger sat with her back to all these
things, in her black horse-hair arm-chair, staring into the fire, her eyes hot, and her chin
on her hand.

"I might have guessed--before," she said. "Ever since that séance. It has been different ..."

She smiled bitterly. "Some shop girl ..."

She mused. "They are all alike, I suppose. They come back--a little damaged, as the woman says
in 'Lady Windermere's Fan.' Perhaps he will. I wonder ..."

"Why should he be so deceitful? Why should he act to me ...?"

"Pretty, pretty, pretty--that is our business. What man hesitates in the choice? He goes his
own way, thinks his own thoughts, does his own work ...

"His dissection is getting behind--one can see he takes scarcely any notes...."

For a long time she was silent. Her face became more intent. She began to bite her thumb, at
first slowly, then faster. She broke out at last into words again.

"The things he might do, the great things he might do. He is able, he is dogged, he is strong.
And then comes a pretty face! Oh God! Why was I made with heart and brain?" She sprang to her
feet, with her hands clenched and her face contorted. But she shed no tears.

Her attitude fell limp in a moment. One hand dropped by her side, the other rested on a fossil
on the mantel-shelf, and she stared down into the red fire.

"To think of all we might have done! It maddens me!

"To work, and think, and learn. To hope and wait. To despise the petty arts of womanliness,
to trust to the sanity of man....

"To awake like the foolish virgins," she said, "and find the hour of life is past!"

Her face, her pose, softened into self-pity.

"Futility ...

"It's no good...." Her voice broke.

"I shall never be happy...."

She saw the grandiose vision of the future she had cherished suddenly rolled aside and vanishing,
more and more splendid as it grew more and more remote--like a dream at the waking moment.
The vision of her inevitable loneliness came to replace it, clear and acute. She saw herself
alone and small in a huge desolation--infinitely pitiful, Lewisham callously receding with
"some shop girl." The tears came, came faster, until they were streaming down her face. She
turned as if looking for something. She flung herself upon her knees before the little arm-chair,
and began an incoherent sobbing prayer for the pity and comfort of God.

       *       *       *       *       *

The next day one of the other girls in the biological course remarked to her friend that "Heydinger-dingery"
had relapsed. Her friend glanced down the laboratory. "It's a bad relapse," she said. "Really
... I couldn't ... wear my hair like that."

She continued to regard Miss Heydinger with a critical eye. She was free to do this because
Miss Heydinger was standing, lost in thought, staring at the December fog outside the laboratory
windows. "She looks white," said the girl who had originally spoken. "I wonder if she works hard."

"It makes precious little difference if she does," said her friend. "I asked her yesterday
what were the bones in the parietal segment, and she didn't know one. Not one."

The next day Miss Heydinger's place was vacant. She was ill--from overstudy--and her illness
lasted to within three weeks of the terminal examination. Then she came back with a pallid
face and a strenuous unavailing industry.

CHAPTER XVII.

IN THE RAPHAEL GALLERY.

It was nearly three o'clock, and in the Biological Laboratory the lamps were all alight. The
class was busy with razors cutting sections of the root of a fern to examine it microscopically.
A certain silent frog-like boy, a private student who plays no further part in this story,
was working intently, looking more like a frog than usual--his expression modest with a touch
of effort. Behind Miss Heydinger, jaded and untidy in her early manner again, was a vacant
seat, an abandoned microscope and scattered pencils and note-books.

On the door of the class-room was a list of those who had passed the Christmas examination.
At the head of it was the name of the aforesaid frog-like boy; next to him came Smithers and
one of the girls bracketed together. Lewisham ingloriously headed the second class, and Miss
Heydinger's name did not appear--there was, the list asserted, "one failure." So the student
pays for the finer emotions.

And in the spacious solitude of the museum gallery devoted to the Raphael cartoons sat Lewisham,
plunged in gloomy meditation. A negligent hand pulled thoughtfully at the indisputable moustache,
with particular attention to such portions as were long enough to gnaw.

He was trying to see the situation clearly. As he was just smarting acutely under his defeat,
this speaks little for the clearness of his mind. The shadow of that defeat lay across everything,
blotted out the light of his pride, shaded his honour, threw everything into a new perspective.
The rich prettiness of his love-making had fled to some remote quarter of his being. Against
the frog-like youngster he felt a savage animosity. And Smithers had betrayed him. He was angry,
bitterly angry, with "swats" and "muggers" who spent their whole time grinding for these foolish
chancy examinations. Nor had the practical examination been altogether fair, and one of the
questions in the written portion was quite outside the lectures. Biver, Professor Biver, was
an indiscriminating ass, he felt assured, and so too was Weeks, the demonstrator. But these
obstacles could not blind his intelligence to the manifest cause of his overthrow, the waste
of more than half his available evening, the best time for study in the twenty-four hours,
day after day. And that was going on steadily, a perpetual leakage of time. To-night he would
go to meet her again, and begin to accumulate to himself ignominy in the second part of the
course, the botanical section, also. And so, reluctantly rejecting one cloudy excuse after
another, he clearly focussed the antagonism between his relations to Ethel and his immediate
ambitions.

Things had come so easily to him for the last two years that he had taken his steady upward
progress in life as assured. It had never occurred to him, when he went to intercept Ethel
after that séance, that he went into any peril of that sort. Now he had had a sharp reminder.
He began to shape a picture of the frog-like boy at home--he was a private student of the upper
middle class--sitting in a convenient study with a writing-table, book-shelves, and a shaded
lamp--Lewisham worked at his chest of drawers, with his greatcoat on, and his feet in the lowest
drawer wrapped in all his available linen--and in the midst of incredible conveniences the
frog-like boy was working, working, working. Meanwhile Lewisham toiled through the foggy streets,
Chelsea-ward, or, after he had left her, tramped homeward--full of foolish imaginings.

He began to think with bloodless lucidity of his entire relationship to Ethel. His softer emotions
were in abeyance, but he told himself no lies. He cared for her, he loved to be with her and
to talk to her and please her, but that was not all his desire. He thought of the bitter words
of an orator at Hammersmith, who had complained that in our present civilisation even the elemental
need of marriage was denied. Virtue had become a vice. "We marry in fear and trembling, sex
for a home is the woman's traffic, and the man comes to his heart's desire when his heart's
desire is dead." The thing which had seemed a mere flourish, came back now with a terrible
air of truth. Lewisham saw that it was a case of divergent ways. On the one hand that shining
staircase to fame and power, that had been his dream from the very dawn of his adolescence,
and on the other hand--Ethel.

And if he chose Ethel, even then, would he have his choice? What would come of it? A few walks
more or less! She was hopelessly poor, he was hopelessly poor, and this cheat of a Medium was
her stepfather! After all she was not well-educated, she did not understand his work and his
aims....

He suddenly perceived with absolute conviction that after the séance he should have gone home
and forgotten her. Why had he felt that irresistible impulse to seek her out? Why had his imagination
spun such a strange web of possibilities about her? He was involved now, foolishly involved....
All his future was a sacrifice to this transitory ghost of love-making in the streets. He pulled
spitefully at his moustache.

His picture began to shape itself into Ethel, and her mysterious mother, and the vague dexterous
Chaffery holding him back, entangled in an impalpable net from that bright and glorious ascent
to performance and distinction. Leaky boots and the splash of cabs for all his life as his
portion! Already the Forbes Medal, the immediate step, was as good as lost....

What on earth had he been thinking about? He fell foul of his upbringing. Men of the upper
or middle classes were put up to these things by their parents; they were properly warned against
involving themselves in this love nonsense before they were independent. It was much better....

Everything was going. Not only his work--his scientific career, but the Debating Society, the
political movement, all his work for Humanity.... Why not be resolute--even now?... Why not
put the thing clearly and plainly to her? Or write? If he wrote now he could get the advantage
of the evening at the Library. He must ask her to forgo these walks home--at least until the
next examination. She would understand. He had a qualm of doubt whether she would understand....
He grew angry at this possibility. But it was no good mincing matters. If once he began to
consider her--Why should he consider her in that way? Simply because she was unreasonable!

Lewisham had a transitory gust of anger.

Yet that abandonment of the walks insisted on looking mean to him. And she would think it mean.
Which was very much worse, somehow. Why mean? Why should she think it mean? He grew angry again.

The portly museum policeman who had been watching him furtively, wondering why a student should
sit in front of the "Sacrifice of Lystra" and gnaw lips and nails and moustache, and scowl
and glare at that masterpiece, saw him rise suddenly to his feet with an air of resolution,
spin on his heel, and set off with a quick step out of the gallery. He looked neither to the
right nor the left. He passed out of sight down the staircase.

"Gone to get some more moustache to eat, I suppose," said the policeman reflectively....

"One 'ud think something had bit him."

After some pensive moments the policeman strolled along down the gallery and came to a stop
opposite the cartoon.

"Figgers is a bit big for the houses," said the policeman, anxious to do impartial justice.
"But that's Art. I lay 'e couldn't do anything ... not arf so good."

CHAPTER XVIII.

THE FRIENDS OF PROGRESS MEET.

The night next but one after this meditation saw a new order in the world. A young lady dressed
in an astrachan-edged jacket and with a face of diminished cheerfulness marched from Chelsea
to Clapham alone, and Lewisham sat in the flickering electric light of the Education Library
staring blankly over a business-like pile of books at unseen things.

The arrangement had not been effected without friction, the explanation had proved difficult.
Evidently she did not appreciate the full seriousness of Lewisham's mediocre position in the
list. "But you have passed all right," she said. Neither could she grasp the importance of
evening study. "Of course I don't know," she said judicially; "but I thought you were learning
all day." She calculated the time consumed by their walk as half an hour, "just one half hour;"
she forgot that he had to get to Chelsea and then to return to his lodgings. Her customary
tenderness was veiled by an only too apparent resentment. First at him, and then when he protested,
at Fate. "I suppose it has to be," she said. "Of course, it doesn't matter, I suppose, if we
don't see each other quite so often," with a quiver of pale lips.

He had returned from the parting with an uneasy mind, and that evening had gone in the composition
of a letter that was to make things clearer. But his scientific studies rendered his prose
style "hard," and things he could whisper he could not write. His justification indeed did
him no sort of justice. But her reception of it made her seem a very unreasonable person. He
had some violent fluctuations. At times he was bitterly angry with her for her failure to see
things as he did. He would wander about the museum conducting imaginary discussions with her
and making even scathing remarks. At other times he had to summon all his powers of acrid discipline
and all his memories of her resentful retorts, to keep himself from a headlong rush to Chelsea
and unmanly capitulation.

And this new disposition of things endured for two weeks. It did not take Miss Heydinger all
that time to discover that the disaster of the examination had wrought a change in Lewisham.
She perceived those nightly walks were over. It was speedily evident to her that he was working
with a kind of dogged fury; he came early, he went late. The wholesome freshness of his cheek
paled. He was to be seen on each of the late nights amidst a pile of diagrams and text-books
in one of the less draughty corners of the Educational Library, accumulating piles of memoranda.
And nightly in the Students' "club" he wrote a letter addressed to a stationer's shop in Clapham,
but that she did not see. For the most part these letters were brief, for Lewisham, South Kensington
fashion, prided himself upon not being "literary," and some of the more despatch-like wounded
a heart perhaps too hungry for tender words.

He did not meet Miss Heydinger's renewed advances with invariable kindness. Yet something of
the old relations were presently restored. He would talk well to her for a time, and then snap
like a dry twig. But the loaning of books was resumed, the subtle process of his aesthetic
education that Miss Heydinger had devised. "Here is a book I promised you," she said one day,
and he tried to remember the promise.

The book was a collection of Browning's Poems, and it contained "Sludge"; it also happened
that it contained "The Statue and the Bust"--that stimulating lecture on half-hearted constraints.
"Sludge" did not interest Lewisham, it was not at all his idea of a medium, but he read and
re-read "The Statue and the Bust." It had the profoundest effect upon him.

By way of fruit it may be to such seed, he dreamed a dream that night. It concerned Ethel,
and at last they were a-marrying. He drew her to his arms. He bent to kiss her. And suddenly
he saw her lips were shrivelled and her eyes were dull, saw the wrinkles seaming her face!
She was old! She was intolerably old! He woke in a kind of horror and lay awake and very dismal
until dawn, thinking of their separation and of her solitary walk through the muddy streets,
thinking of his position, the leeway he had lost and the chances there were against him in
the battle of the world. He perceived the colourless truth; the Career was improbable, and
that Ethel should be added to it was almost hopeless. Clearly the question was between these
two. Or should he vacillate and lose both? And then his wretchedness gave place to that anger
that comes of perpetually thwarted desires....

It was on the day after this dream that he insulted Parkson so grossly. He insulted Parkson
after a meeting of the "Friends of Progress" at Parkson's rooms.

No type of English student quite realises the noble ideal of plain living and high thinking
nowadays. Our admirable examination system admits of extremely little thinking at any level,
high or low. But the Kensington student's living is at any rate insufficient, and he makes
occasional signs of recognition towards the cosmic process.

One such sign was the periodic gathering of these "Friends of Progress," an association begotten
of Lewisham's paper on Socialism. It was understood that strenuous things were to be done to
make the world better, but so far no decisive action had been taken.

They met in Parkson's sitting-room, because Parkson was the only one of the Friends opulent
enough to have a sitting-room, he being a Whitworth Scholar and in receipt of one hundred pounds
a year. The Friends were of various ages, mostly very young. Several smoked and others held
pipes which they had discontinued smoking--but there was nothing to drink, except coffee, because
that was the extent of their means. Dunkerley, an assistant master in a suburban school, and
Lewisham's former colleague at Whortley, attended these assemblies through the introduction
of Lewisham. All the Friends wore red ties except Bletherley, who wore an orange one to show
that he was aware of Art, and Dunkerley, who wore a black one with blue specks, because assistant
masters in small private schools have to keep up appearances. And their simple procedure was
that each talked as much as the others would suffer.

Usually the self-proposed "Luther of Socialism"--ridiculous Lewisham!--had a thesis or so to
maintain, but this night he was depressed and inattentive. He sat with his legs over the arm
of his chair by way of indicating the state of his mind. He had a packet of Algerian cigarettes
(twenty for fivepence), and appeared chiefly concerned to smoke them all before the evening
was out. Bletherley was going to discourse of "Woman under Socialism," and he brought a big
American edition of Shelley's works and a volume of Tennyson with the "Princess," both bristling
with paper tongues against his marked quotations. He was all for the abolition of "monopolies,"
and the créche was to replace the family. He was unctuous when he was not pretty-pretty, and
his views were evidently unpopular.

Parkson was a man from Lancashire, and a devout Quaker; his third and completing factor was
Ruskin, with whose work and phraseology he was saturated. He listened to Bletherley with a
marked disapproval, and opened a vigorous defence of that ancient tradition of loyalty that
Bletherley had called the monopolist institution of marriage. "The pure and simple old theory--love
and faithfulness," said Parkson, "suffices for me. If we are to smear our political movements
with this sort of stuff ..."

"Does it work?" interjected Lewisham, speaking for the first time.

"What work?"

"The pure and simple old theory. I know the theory. I believe in the theory. Bletherley's Shelley-witted.
But it's theory. You meet the inevitable girl. The theory says you may meet her anywhen. You
meet too young. You fall in love. You marry--in spite of obstacles. Love laughs at locksmiths.
You have children. That's the theory. All very well for a man whose father can leave him five
hundred a year. But how does it work for a shopman?... An assistant master like Dunkerley?
Or ... Me?"

"In these cases one must exercise restraint," said Parkson. "Have faith. A man that is worth
having is worth waiting for."

"Worth growing old for?" said Lewisham.

"Chap ought to fight," said Dunkerley. "Don't see your difficulty, Lewisham. Struggle for existence
keen, no doubt, tremendous in fact--still. In it--may as well struggle. Two--join forces--pool
the luck. If I saw, a girl I fancied so that I wanted to, I'd marry her to-morrow. And my market
value is seventy non res."

Lewisham looked round at him eagerly, suddenly interested. "Would you?" he said. Dunkerley's
face was slightly flushed.

"Like a shot. Why not?"

"But how are you to live?"

"That comes after. If ..."

"I can't agree with you, Mr. Dunkerley," said Parkson. "I don't know if you have read Sesame
and Lilies, but there you have, set forth far more fairly than any words of mine could do,
an ideal of a woman's place ..."

"All rot--Sesame and Lilies," interrupted Dunkerley. "Read bits. Couldn't stand it. Never can
stand Ruskin. Too many prepositions. Tremendous English, no doubt, but not my style. Sort of
thing a wholesale grocer's daughter might read to get refined. We can't afford to get refined."

"But would you really marry a girl ...?" began Lewisham, with an unprecedented admiration for
Dunkerley in his eyes.

"Why not?"

"On--?" Lewisham hesitated.

"Forty pounds a year res. Whack! Yes."

A silent youngster began to speak, cleared an accumulated huskiness from his throat and said,
"Consider the girl."

"Why marry?" asked Bletherley, unregarded.

"You must admit you are asking a great thing when you want a girl ..." began Parkson.

"Not so. When a girl's chosen a man, and he chooses her, her place is with him. What is the
good of hankering? Mutual. Fight together."

"Good!" said Lewisham, suddenly emotional. "You talk like a man, Dunkerley. I'm hanged if you
don't."

"The place of Woman," insisted Parkson, "is the Home. And if there is no home--! I hold that,
if need be, a man should toil seven years--as Jacob did for Rachel--ruling his passions, to
make the home fitting and sweet for her ..."

"Get the hutch for the pet animal," said Dunkerley. "No. I mean to marry a woman. Female sex
always has been in the struggle for existence--no great damage so far--always will be. Tremendous
idea--that struggle for existence. Only sensible theory you've got hold of, Lewisham. Woman
who isn't fighting square side by side with a man--woman who's just kept and fed and petted
is ..." He hesitated.

A lad with a spotted face and a bulldog pipe between his teeth supplied a Biblical word.

"That's shag," said Dunkerley, "I was going to say 'a harem of one'"

The youngster was puzzled for a moment. "I smoke Perique," he said.

"It will make you just as sick," said Dunkerley.

"Refinement's so beastly vulgar," was the belated answer of the smoker of Perique.

That was the interesting part of the evening to Lewisham. Parkson suddenly rose, got down "Sesame
and Lilies," and insisted upon reading a lengthy mellifluous extract that went like a garden
roller over the debate, and afterwards Bletherley became the centre of a wrangle that left
him grossly insulted and in a minority of one. The institution of marriage, so far as the South
Kensington student is concerned, is in no immediate danger.

Parkson turned out with the rest of them at half-past ten, for a walk. The night was warm for
February and the waxing moon bright. Parkson fixed himself upon Lewisham and Dunkerley, to
Lewisham's intense annoyance--for he had a few intimate things he could have said to the man
of Ideas that night. Dunkerley lived north, so that the three went up Exhibition Road to High
Street, Kensington. There they parted from Dunkerley, and Lewisham and Parkson turned southward
again for Lewisham's new lodging in Chelsea.

Parkson was one of those exponents of virtue for whom the discussion of sexual matters has
an irresistible attraction. The meeting had left him eloquent. He had argued with Dunkerley
to the verge of indelicacy, and now he poured out a vast and increasingly confidential flow
of talk upon Lewisham. Lewisham was distraught. He walked as fast as he could. His sole object
was to get rid of Parkson. Parkson's sole object was to tell him interesting secrets, about
himself and a Certain Person with a mind of extraordinary Purity of whom Lewisham had heard before.

Ages passed.

Lewisham suddenly found himself being shown a photograph under a lamp. It represented an unsymmetrical
face singularly void of expression, the upper part of an "art" dress, and a fringe of curls.
He perceived he was being given to understand that this was a Paragon of Purity, and that she
was the particular property of Parkson. Parkson was regarding him proudly, and apparently awaiting
his verdict.

Lewisham struggled with the truth. "It's an interesting face," he said.

"It is a face essentially beautiful," said Parkson quietly but firmly. "Do you notice the eyes,
Lewisham?"

"Oh yes," said Lewisham. "Yes. I see the eyes."

"They are ... innocent. They are the eyes of a little child."

"Yes. They look that sort of eye. Very nice, old man. I congratulate you. Where does she live?"

"You never saw a face like that in London," said Parkson. 

Her is curiously might be deceived like intellectual.

 They had said scarcely anything
to one another, save hasty directions from Lewisham, but their eyes were full of excitement,
and under the apron of the cab their hands were gripped together.

The little old gentleman was business-like but kindly. They made their vows to him, to a little
black-bearded clerk and a lady who took off an apron in the nether part of the building to
attend. The little old gentleman made no long speeches. "You are young people," he said slowly,
"and life together is a difficult thing.... Be kind to each other." He smiled a little sadly,
and held out a friendly hand.

Ethel's eyes glistened and she found she could not speak.

CHAPTER XXI.

HOME!

Then a furtive payment of witnesses, and Lewisham was beside her. His face was radiant. A steady
current of workers going home to their half-holiday rest poured along the street. On the steps
before them lay a few grains of rice from some more public nuptials.

A critical little girl eyed our couple curiously and made some remark to her ragamuffin friend.

"Not them," said the ragamuffin friend, "They've only been askin' questions."

The ragamuffin friend was no judge of faces.

They walked back through the thronged streets to Vauxhall station, saying little to one another,
and there Lewisham, assuming as indifferent a manner as he could command, recovered their possessions
from the booking-office by means of two separate tickets and put them aboard a four-wheeler.
His luggage went outside, but the little brown portmanteau containing Ethel's trousseau was
small enough to go on the seat in front of them. You must figure a rather broken-down four-wheeler
bearing the yellow-painted box and the experienced trunk and Mr. Lewisham and all his fortunes,
a despondent fitful horse, and a threadbare venerable driver, blasphemous sotto voce and flagellant,
in an ancient coat with capes. When our two young people found themselves in the cab again
a certain stiffness of manner between them vanished and there was more squeezing of hands.
"Ethel Lewisham," said Lewisham several times, and Ethel reciprocated with "Husbinder" and
"Hubby dear," and took off her glove to look again in an ostentatious manner at a ring. And
she kissed the ring.

They were resolved that their newly-married state should not appear, and with considerable
ceremony it was arranged that he should treat her with off-hand brusqueness when they arrived
at their lodging. The Teutonic landlady appeared in the passage with an amiable smile and the
hope that they had had a pleasant journey, and became voluble with promises of comfort. Lewisham
having assisted the slatternly general servant to carry in his boxes, paid the cabman a florin
in a resolute manner and followed the ladies into the sitting-room.

Ethel answered Madam Gadow's inquiries with admirable self-possession, followed her through
the folding-doors and displayed an intelligent interest in a new spring mattress. Presently
the folding-doors were closed again. Lewisham hovered about the front room pulling his moustache
and pretending to admire the oleographs, surprised to find himself trembling....

The slatternly general servant reappeared with the chops and tinned salmon he had asked Madam
Gadow to prepare for them. He went and stared out of the window, heard the door close behind
the girl, and turned at a sound as Ethel appeared shyly through the folding-doors.

She was suddenly domestic. Hitherto he had seen her without a hat and jacket only on one indistinct
dramatic occasion. Now she wore a little blouse of soft, dark red material, with a white froth
about the wrists and that pretty neck of hers. And her hair was a new wonderland of curls and
soft strands. How delicate she looked and sweet as she stood hesitating there. These gracious
moments in life! He took two steps and held out his arms. She glanced at the closed door of
the room and came flitting towards him....

CHAPTER XXII.

EPITHALAMY.

For three indelible days Lewisham's existence was a fabric of fine emotions, life was too wonderful
and beautiful for any doubts or forethought. To be with Ethel was perpetual delight--she astonished
this sisterless youngster with a thousand feminine niceties and refinements. She shamed him
for his strength and clumsiness. And the light in her eyes and the warmth in her heart that
lit them!

Even to be away from her was a wonder and in its way delightful. He was no common Student,
he was a man with a Secret Life. To part from her on Monday near South Kensington station and
go up Exhibition Road among all the fellows who lived in sordid, lonely lodgings and were boys
to his day-old experience! To neglect one's work and sit back and dream of meeting again! To
slip off to the shady churchyard behind the Oratory when, or even a little before, the midday
bell woke the great staircase to activity, and to meet a smiling face and hear a soft, voice
saying sweet foolish things! And after four another meeting and the walk home--their own home.

No little form now went from him and flitted past a gas lamp down a foggy vista, taking his
desire with her. Never more was that to be. Lewisham's long hours in the laboratory were spent
largely in a dreamy meditation, in--to tell the truth--the invention of foolish terms of endearment:
"Dear Wife," "Dear Little Wife Thing," "Sweetest Dearest Little Wife," "Dillywings." A pretty
employment! And these are quite a fair specimen of his originality during those wonderful days.
A moment of heart-searching in that particular matter led to the discovery of hitherto undreamt-of
kindred with Swift. For Lewisham, like Swift and most other people, had hit upon, the Little
Language. Indeed it was a very foolish time.

Such section cutting as he did that third day of his married life--and he did very little--was
a thing to marvel at. Bindon, the botany professor, under the fresh shock of his performance,
protested to a colleague in the grill room that never had a student been so foolishly overrated.

And Ethel too had a fine emotional time. She was mistress of a home--their home together. She
shopped and was called "Ma'am" by respectful, good-looking shopmen; she designed meals and
copied out papers of notes with a rich sense of helpfulness. And ever and again she would stop
writing and sit dreaming. And for four bright week-days she went to and fro to accompany and
meet Lewisham and listen greedily to the latest fruits of his imagination.

The landlady was very polite and conversed entertainingly about the very extraordinary and
dissolute servants that had fallen to her lot. And Ethel disguised her newly wedded state by
a series of ingenious prevarications. She wrote a letter that Saturday evening to her mother--Lewisham
had helped her to write it--making a sort of proclamation of her heroic departure and promising
a speedy visit. They posted the letter so that it might not be delivered until Monday.

She was quite sure with Lewisham that only the possible dishonour of mediumship could have
brought their marriage about--she sank the mutual attraction beyond even her own vision. There
was more than a touch of magnificence, you perceive, about this affair.

It was Lewisham had persuaded her to delay that reassuring visit until Monday night. "One whole
day of honeymoon," he insisted, was to be theirs. In his prenuptial meditations he had not
clearly focussed the fact that even after marriage some sort of relations with Mr. and Mrs.
Chaffery would still go on. Even now he was exceedingly disinclined to face that obvious necessity.
He foresaw, in spite of a resolute attempt to ignore it, that there would be explanatory scenes
of some little difficulty. But the prevailing magnificence carried him over this trouble.

"Let us at least have this little time for ourselves," he said, and that seemed to settle their
position.

Save for its brevity and these intimations of future trouble it was a very fine time indeed.
Their midday dinner together, for example--it was a little cold when at last they came to it
on Saturday--was immense fun. There was no marked subsidence of appetite; they ate extremely
well in spite of the meeting of their souls, and in spite of certain shiftings of chairs and
hand claspings and similar delays. He really made the acquaintance of her hands then for the
first time, plump white hands with short white fingers, and the engagement ring had come out
of its tender hiding-place and acted as keeper to the wedding ring. Their eyes were perpetually
flitting about the room and coming back to mutual smiles. All their movements were faintly
tremulous.

She professed to be vastly interested and amused by the room and its furniture and her position,
and he was delighted by her delight. She was particularly entertained by the chest of drawers
in the living room, and by Lewisham's witticisms at the toilet tidies and the oleographs.

And after the chops and the most of the tinned salmon and the very new loaf were gone they
fell to with fine effect upon a tapioca pudding. Their talk was fragmentary. "Did you hear
her call me Madame? Mádáme--so!" "And presently I must go out and do some shopping. There are
all the things for Sunday and Monday morning to get. I must make a list. It will never do to
let her know how little I know about things.... I wish I knew more."

At the time Lewisham regarded her confession of domestic ignorance as a fine basis for facetiousness.
He developed a fresh line of thought, and condoled with her on the inglorious circumstances
of their wedding. "No bridesmaids," he said; "no little children scattering flowers, no carriages,
no policemen to guard the wedding presents, nothing proper--nothing right. Not even a white
favour. Only you and I."

"Only you and I. Oh!"

"This is nonsense," said Lewisham, after an interval.

"And think what we lose in the way of speeches," he resumed. "Cannot you imagine the best man
rising:--'Ladies and gentlemen--the health of the bride.' That is what the best man has to
do, isn't it?"

By way of answer she extended her hand.

"And do you know," he said, after that had received due recognition, "we have never been introduced!"

"Neither have we!" said Ethel. "Neither have we! We have never been introduced!"

For some inscrutable reason it delighted them both enormously to think that they had never
been introduced....

In the later afternoon Lewisham, having unpacked his books to a certain extent, and so forth,
was visible to all men, visibly in the highest spirits, carrying home Ethel's shopping. There
were parcels and cones in blue and parcels in rough grey paper and a bag of confectionery,
and out of one of the side pockets of that East-end overcoat the tail of a haddock protruded
from its paper. Under such magnificent sanctions and amid such ignoble circumstances did this
honeymoon begin.

On Sunday evening they went for a long rambling walk through the quiet streets, coming out
at last into Hyde Park. The early spring night was mild and clear and the kindly moonlight
was about them. They went to the bridge and looked down the Serpentine, with the little lights
of Paddington yellow and remote. They stood there, dim little figures and very close together.
They whispered and became silent.

Presently it seemed that something passed and Lewisham began talking in his magnificent vein.
He likened the Serpentine to Life, and found Meaning in the dark banks of Kensington Gardens
and the remote bright lights. "The long struggle," he said, "and the lights at the end,"--though
he really did not know what he meant by the lights at the end. Neither did Ethel, though the
emotion was indisputable. "We are Fighting the World," he said, finding great satisfaction
in the thought. "All the world is against us--and we are fighting it all."

"We will not be beaten," said Ethel.

"How could we be beaten--together?" said Lewisham. "For you I would fight a dozen worlds."

It seemed a very sweet and noble thing to them under the sympathetic moonlight, almost indeed
too easy for their courage, to be merely fighting the world.

       *       *       *       *       *

"You 'aven't bin married ver' long," said Madam Gadow with an insinuating smile, when she readmitted
Ethel on Monday morning after Lewisham had been swallowed up by the Schools.

"No, I haven't very long," admitted Ethel.

"You are ver' 'appy," said Madam Gadow, and sighed.

"I was ver' 'appy," said Madam Gadow.

CHAPTER XXIII.

MR. CHAFFERY AT HOME.

The golden mists of delight lifted a little on Monday, when Mr. and Mrs. G.E. Lewisham went
to call on his mother-in-law and Mr. Chaffery. Mrs. Lewisham went in evident apprehension,
but clouds of glory still hung about Lewisham's head, and his manner was heroic. He wore a
cotton shirt and linen collar, and a very nice black satin tie that Mrs. Lewisham had bought
on her own responsibility during the day. She naturally wanted him to look all right.

Mrs. Chaffery appeared in the half light of the passage as the top of a grimy cap over Ethel's
shoulder and two black sleeves about her neck. She emerged as a small, middle-aged woman, with
a thin little nose between silver-rimmed spectacles, a weak mouth and perplexed eyes, a queer
little dust-lined woman with the oddest resemblance to Ethel in her face. She was trembling
visibly with nervous agitation.

She hesitated, peering, and then kissed Mr. Lewisham effusively. "And this is Mr. Lewisham!"
she said as she did so.

She was the third thing feminine to kiss Lewisham since the promiscuous days of his babyhood.
"I was so afraid--There!" She laughed hysterically.

"You'll excuse my saying that it's comforting to see you--honest like and young. Not but what
Ethel ... He has been something dreadful," said Mrs. Chaffery. "You didn't ought to have written
about that mesmerising. And of all letters that which Jane wrote--there! But he's waiting and
listening--"

"Are we to go downstairs, Mums?" asked Ethel.

"He's waiting for you there," said Mrs. Chaffery. She held a dismal little oil lamp, and they
descended a tenebrous spiral structure into an underground breakfast-room lit by gas that shone
through a partially frosted globe with cut-glass stars. That descent had a distinctly depressing
effect upon Lewisham. He went first. He took a deep breath at the door. What on earth was Chaffery
going to say? Not that he cared, of course.

Chaffery was standing with his back to the fire, trimming his finger-nails with a pocket-knife.
His gilt glasses were tilted forward so as to make an inflamed knob at the top of his long
nose, and he regarded Mr. and Mrs. Lewisham over them with--Lewisham doubted his eyes for a
moment--but it was positively a smile, an essentially waggish smile.

"You've come back," he said quite cheerfully over Lewisham to Ethel. There was a hint of falsetto
in his voice.

"She has called to see her mother," said Lewisham. "You, I believe, are Mr. Chaffery?"

"I would like to know who the Deuce you are?" said Chaffery, suddenly tilting his head back
so as to look through his glasses instead of over them, and laughing genially. "For thoroughgoing
Cheek, I'm inclined to think you take the Cake. Are you the Mr. Lewisham to whom this misguided
girl refers in her letter?"

"I am."

"Maggie," said Mr. Chaffery to Mrs. Chaffery, "there is a class of being upon whom delicacy
is lost--to whom delicacy is practically unknown. Has your daughter got her marriage lines?"

"Mr. Chaffery!" said Lewisham, and Mrs. Chaffery exclaimed, "James! How can you?"

Chaffery shut his penknife with a click and slipped it into his vest-pocket. Then he looked
up again, speaking in the same equal voice. "I presume we are civilised persons prepared to
manage our affairs in a civilised way. My stepdaughter vanishes for two nights and returns
with an alleged husband. I at least am not disposed to be careless about her legal position."

"You ought to know her better--" began Lewisham.

"Why argue about it," said Chaffery gaily, pointing a lean finger at Ethel's gesture, "when
she has 'em in her pocket? She may just as well show me now. I thought so. Don't be alarmed
at my handling them. Fresh copies can always be got at the nominal price of two-and-seven.
Thank you ... Lewisham, George Edgar. One-and-twenty. And ... You--one-and-twenty! I never
did know your age, my dear, exactly, and now your mother won't say. Student!  Thank you. I
am greatly obliged. Indeed I am greatly relieved. And now, what have you got to say for yourselves
in this remarkable affair?"

"You had a letter," said Lewisham.

"I had a letter of excuses--the personalities I overlook ... Yes, sir--they were excuses. You
young people wanted to marry--and you seized an occasion. You did not even refer to the fact
that you wanted to marry in your letter. Pure modesty! But now you have come here married.
It disorganises this household, it inflicts endless bother on people, but never you mind that!
I'm not blaming you. Nature's to blame! Neither of you know what you are in for yet. You will.
You're married, and that is the great essential thing.... (Ethel, my dear, just put your husband's
hat and stick behind the door.) And you, sir, are so good as to disapprove of the way in which
I earn my living?"

"Well," said Lewisham. "Yes--I'm bound to say I do."

"You are really not bound to say it. The modesty of inexperience would excuse you."

"Yes, but it isn't right--it isn't straight."

"Dogma," said Chaffery. "Dogma!"

"What do you mean by dogma?" asked Lewisham.

"I mean, dogma. But we must argue this out in comfort. It is our supper hour, and I'm not the
man to fight against accomplished facts. We have intermarried. There it is. You must stop to
supper--and you and I must thresh these things out. We've involved ourselves with each other
and we've got to make the best of it. Your wife and mine will spread the board, and we will
go on talking. Why not sit in that chair instead of leaning on the back? This is a home--domus--not
a debating society--humble in spite of my manifest frauds.... That's better. And in the first
place I hope--I do so hope"--Chaffery was suddenly very impressive--"that you're not a Dissenter."

"Eh!" said Lewisham, and then, "No! I am not a Dissenter."

"That's better," said Mr. Chaffery. "I'm glad of that. I was just a little afraid--Something
in your manner. I can't stand Dissenters. I've a peculiar dislike to Dissenters. To my mind
it's the great drawback of this Clapham. You see ... I have invariably found them deceitful--invariably."

He grimaced and dropped his glasses with a click against his waistcoat buttons. "I'm very glad
of that," he said, replacing them. "The Dissenter, the Nonconformist Conscience, the Puritan,
you know, the Vegetarian and Total Abstainer, and all that sort of thing, I cannot away with
them. I have cleared my mind of cant and formulae. I've a nature essentially Hellenic. Have
you ever read Matthew Arnold?"

"Beyond my scientific reading--"

"Ah! you should read Matthew Arnold--a mind of singular clarity. In him you would find a certain
quality that is sometimes a little wanting in your scientific men. They are apt to be a little
too phenomenal, you know, a little too objective. Now I seek after noumena. Noumena, Mr. Lewisham!
If you follow me--?"

He paused, and his eyes behind the glasses were mildly interrogative. Ethel re-entered without
her hat and jacket, and with a noisy square black tray, a white cloth, some plates and knives
and glasses, and began to lay the table.

"I follow you," said Lewisham, reddening. He had not the courage to admit ignorance of this
remarkable word. "You state your case."

"I seek after noumena," repeated Chaffery with great satisfaction, and gesticulated with his
hand, waving away everything but that. "I cannot do with surfaces and appearances. I am one
of those nympholepts, you know, nympholepts ... Must pursue the truth of things! the elusive
fundamental ... I make a rule, I never tell myself lies--never. There are few who can say that.
To my mind--truth begins at home. And for the most part--stops there. Safest and seemliest!
you know. With most men--with your typical Dissenter par excellence--it's always gadding abroad,
calling on the neighbours. You see my point of view?"

He glanced at Lewisham, who was conscious of an unwonted opacity of mind. He became wary, as
wary as he could manage to be on the spur of the moment.

"It's a little surprising, you know," he said very carefully, "if I may say so--and considering
what happened--to hear you ..."

"Speaking of truth? Not when you understand my position. Not when you see where I stand. That
is what I am getting at. That is what I am naturally anxious to make clear to you now that
we have intermarried, now that you are my stepson-in-law. You're young, you know, you're young,
and you're hard and fast. Only years can give a mind tone--mitigate the varnish of education.
I gather from this letter--and your face--that you are one of the party that participated in
that little affair at Lagune's."

He stuck out a finger at a point he had just seen. "By-the-bye!--That accounts for Ethel," he said.

Ethel rapped down the mustard on the table. "It does," she said, but not very loudly.

"But you had met before?" said Chaffery.

"At Whortley," said Lewisham.

"I see," said Chaffery.

"I was in--I was one of those who arranged the exposure," said Lewisham. "And now you have
raised the matter, I am bound to say--"

"I knew," interrupted Chaffery. "But what a shock that was for Lagune!" He looked down at his
toes for a moment with the corners of his mouth tucked in. "The hand dodge wasn't bad, you
know," he said, with a queer sidelong smile.

Lewisham was very busy for a moment trying to get this remark in focus. "I don't see it in
the same light as you do," he explained at last.

"Can't get away from your moral bias, eh?--Well, well. We'll go into all that. But apart from
its moral merits--simply as an artistic trick--it was not bad."

"I don't know much about tricks--"

"So few who undertake exposures do. You admit you never heard or thought of that before--the
bladder, I mean. Yet it's as obvious as tintacks that a medium who's hampered at his hands
will do all he can with his teeth, and what could be so self-evident as a bladder under one's
lappel? What could be? Yet I know psychic literature pretty well, and it's never been suggested
even! Never. It's a perpetual surprise to me how many things are not thought of by investigators.
For one thing, they never count the odds against them, and that puts them wrong at the start.
Look at it! I am by nature tricky. I spend all my leisure standing or sitting about and thinking
up or practising new little tricks, because it amuses me immensely to do so. The whole thing
amuses me. Well--what is the result of these meditations? Take one thing:--I know eight-and-forty
ways of making raps--of which at least ten are original. Ten original ways of making raps."
His manner was very impressive. "And some of them simply tremendous raps. There!"

A confirmatory rap exploded--as it seemed between Lewisham and Chaffery.

"Eh?" said Chaffery.

The mantelpiece opened a dropping fire, and the table went off under Lewisham's nose like a
cracker.

"You see?" said Chaffery, putting his hands under the tail of his coat. The whole room seemed
snapping its fingers at Lewisham for a space.

"Very well, and now take the other side. Take the severest test I ever tried. Two respectable
professors of physics--not Newtons, you understand, but good, worthy, self-important professors
of physics--a lady anxious to prove there's a life beyond the grave, a journalist who wants
stuff to write--a person, that is, who gets his living by these researches just as I do--undertook
to test me. Test me!... Of course they had their other work to do, professing physics, professing
religion, organising research, and so forth. At the outside they don't think an hour a day
about it, and most of them had never cheated anybody in their existence, and couldn't, for
example, travel without a ticket for a three-mile journey and not get caught, to save their
lives.... Well--you see the odds?"

He paused. Lewisham appeared involved in some interior struggle.

"You know," explained Chaffery, "it was quite an accident you got me--quite. The thing slipped
out of my mouth. Or your friend with, the flat voice wouldn't have had a chance. Not a chance."

Lewisham spoke like a man who is lifting a weight. "All this, you know, is off the question.
I'm not disputing your ability. But the thing is ... it isn't right."

"We're coming to that," said Chaffery.

"It's evident we look at things in a different light."

"That's it. That's just what we've got to discuss. Exactly!"

"Cheating is cheating. You can't get away from that. That's simple enough."

"Wait till I've done with it," said Chaffery with a certain zest. "Of course it's imperative
you should understand my position. It isn't as though I hadn't one. Ever since I read your
letter I've been thinking over that. Really!--a justification! In a way you might almost say
I had a mission. A sort of prophet. You really don't see the beginning of it yet."

"Oh, but hang it!" protested Lewisham.

"Ah! you're young, you're crude. My dear young man, you're only at the beginning of things.
You really must concede a certain possibility of wider views to a man more than twice your
age. But here's supper. For a little while at any rate we'll call a truce."

Ethel had come in again bearing an additional chair, and Mrs. Chaffery appeared behind her,
crowning the preparations with a jug of small beer. The cloth, Lewisham observed, as he turned
towards it, had several undarned holes and discoloured places, and in the centre stood a tarnished
cruet which contained mustard, pepper, vinegar, and three ambiguous dried-up bottles. The bread
was on an ample board with a pious rim, and an honest wedge of cheese loomed disproportionate
on a little plate. Mr. and Mrs. Lewisham were seated facing one another, and Mrs. Chaffery
sat in the broken chair because she understood its ways.

"This cheese is as nutritious and unattractive and indigestible as Science," remarked Chaffery,
cutting and passing wedges. "But crush it--so--under your fork, add a little of this good Dorset
butter, a dab of mustard, pepper--the pepper is very necessary--and some malt vinegar, and
crush together. You get a compound called Crab and by no means disagreeable. So the wise deal
with the facts of life, neither bolting nor rejecting, but adapting."

"As though pepper and mustard were not facts," said Lewisham, scoring his solitary point that
evening.

Chaffery admitted the collapse of his image in very complimentary terms, and Lewisham could
not avoid a glance across the table at Ethel. He remembered that Chaffery was a slippery scoundrel
whose blame was better than his praise, immediately afterwards.

For a time the Crab engaged Chaffery, and the conversation languished. Mrs. Chaffery asked
Ethel formal questions about their lodgings, and Ethel's answers were buoyant, "You must come
and have tea one day," said Ethel, not waiting for Lewisham's endorsement, "and see it all."

Chaffery astonished Lewisham by suddenly displaying a complete acquaintance with his status
as a South Kensington teacher in training. "I suppose you have some money beyond that guinea,"
said Chaffery offhandedly.

"Enough to go on with," said Lewisham, reddening.

"And you look to them at South Kensington, to do something for you--a hundred a year or so,
when your scholarship is up?"

"Yes," said Lewisham a little reluctantly. "Yes. A hundred a year or so. That's the sort of
idea. And there's lots of places beyond South Kensington, of course, even if they don't put
me up there."

"I see," said Chaffery; "but it will be a pretty close shave for all that--one hundred a year.
Well, well--there's many a deserving man has to do with less," and after a meditative pause
he asked Lewisham to pass the beer.

"Hev you a mother living, Mr. Lewisham?" said Mrs. Chaffery suddenly, and pursued him through
the tale of his connexions. When he came to the plumber, Mrs. Chaffery remarked with an unexpected
air of consequence that most families have their poor relations. Then the air of consequence
vanished again into the past from which it had arisen.

Supper finished, Chaffery poured the residuum of the beer into his glass, produced a Broseley
clay of the longest sort, and invited Lewisham to smoke. "Honest smoking," said Chaffery, tapping
the bowl of his clay, and added: "In this country--cigars--sound cigars--and honesty rarely meet."

Lewisham fumbled in his pocket for his Algerian cigarettes, and Chaffery having regarded them
unfavourably through his glasses, took up the thread of his promised apologia. The ladies retired
to wash up the supper things.

"You see," said Chaffery, opening abruptly so soon as the clay was drawing, about this cheating--I
do not find life such a simple matter as you do."

"I don't find life simple," said Lewisham, "but I do think there's a Right and a Wrong in things.
And I don't think you have said anything so far to show that spiritualistic cheating is Right."

"Let us thresh the matter out," said Chaffery, crossing his legs; "let us thresh the matter
out. Now"--he drew at his pipe--"I don't think you fully appreciate the importance of Illusion
in life, the Essential Nature of Lies and Deception of the body politic. You are inclined to
discredit one particular form of Imposture, because it is not generally admitted--carries a
certain discredit, and--witness the heel edges of my trouser legs, witness yonder viands--small
rewards."

"It's not that," said Lewisham.

"Now I am prepared to maintain," said Chaffery, proceeding with his proposition, "that Honesty
is essentially an anarchistic and disintegrating force in society, that communities are held
together and the progress of civilisation made possible only by vigorous and sometimes even,
violent Lying; that the Social Contract is nothing more or less than a vast conspiracy of human
beings to lie to and humbug themselves and one another for the general Good. Lies are the mortar
that bind the savage Individual man into the social masonry. There is the general thesis upon
which I base my justification. My mediumship, I can assure you, is a particular instance of
the general assertion. Were I not of a profoundly indolent, restless, adventurous nature, and
horribly averse to writing, I would make a great book of this and live honoured by every profound
duffer in the world."

"But how are you going to prove it?"

"Prove It! It simply needs pointing out. Even now there are men--Bernard Shaw, Ibsen, and such
like--who have seen bits of it in a new-gospel-grubbing sort of fashion. What Is man? Lust
and greed tempered by fear and an irrational vanity."

"I don't agree with that," said Mr. Lewisham.

"You will as you grow older," said Chaffery. "There's truths you have to grow into. But about
this matter of Lies--let us look at the fabric of society, let us compare the savage. You will
discover the only essential difference between savage and civilised is this: The former hasn't
learnt to shirk the truth of things, and the latter has. Take the most obvious difference--the
clothing of the civilised man, his invention of decency. What is clothing? The concealment
of essential facts. What is decorum? Suppression! I don't argue against decency and decorum,
mind you, but there they are--essentials to civilisation and essentially 'suppressio veri.'
And in the pockets of his clothes our citizen carries money. The pure savage has no money.
To him a lump of metal is a lump of metal--possibly ornamental--no more. That's right. To any
lucid-minded man it's the same or different only through the gross folly of his fellows. But
to the common civilised man the universal exchangeability of this gold is a sacred and fundamental
fact. Think of it! Why should it be? There isn't a why! I live in perpetual amazement at the
gullibility of my fellow-creatures. Of a morning sometimes, I can assure you, I lie in bed
fancying that people may have found out this swindle in the night, expect to hear a tumult
downstairs and see your mother-in-law come rushing into the room with a rejected shilling from
the milkman. 'What's this?' says he. 'This Muck for milk?' But it never happens. Never. If
it did, if people suddenly cleared their minds of this cant of money, what would happen? The
true nature of man would appear. I should whip out of bed, seize some weapon, and after the
milkman forthwith. It's becoming to keep the peace, but it's necessary to have milk. The neighbours
would come pouring out--also after milk. Milkman, suddenly enlightened, would start clattering
up the street. After him! Clutch--tear! Got him! Over goes the cart! Fight if you like, but
don't upset the can!... Don't you see it all?--perfectly reasonable every bit of it. I should
return, bruised and bloody, with the milk-can under my arm. Yes, I should have the milk-can--I
should keep my eye on that.... But why go on? You of all men should know that life is a struggle
for existence, a fight for food. Money is just the lie that mitigates our fury."

"No," said Lewisham; "no! I'm not prepared to admit that."

"What is money?"

Mr. Lewisham dodged. "You state your case first," he said. "I really don't see what all this
has to do with cheating at a séance."

"I weave my defence from this loom, though. Take some aggressively respectable sort of man--a
bishop, for example."

"Well," said Lewisham, "I don't much hold with bishops."

"It doesn't matter. Take a professor of science, walking the earth. Remark his clothing, making
a decent citizen out of him, concealing the fact that physically he is a flabby, pot-bellied
degenerate. That is the first Lie of his being. No fringes round his trousers, my boy. Notice
his hair, groomed and clipped, the tacit lie that its average length is half an inch, whereas
in nature he would wave a few score yard-long hairs of ginger grey to the winds of heaven.
Notice the smug suppressions of his face. In his mouth are Lies in the shape of false teeth.
Then on the earth somewhere poor devils are toiling to get him meat and corn and wine. He is
clothed in the lives of bent and thwarted weavers, his Way is lit by phossy jaw, he eats from
lead-glazed crockery--all his ways are paved with the lives of men.... Think of the chubby,
comfortable creature! And, as Swift has it--to think that such a thing should deal in pride!...
He pretends that his blessed little researches are in some way a fair return to these remote
beings for their toil, their suffering; pretends that he and his parasitic career are payment
for their thwarted desires. Imagine him bullying his gardener over some transplanted geraniums,
the thick mist of lies they stand in, so that the man does not immediately with the edge of
a spade smite down his impertinence to the dust from which it rose.... And his case is the
case of all comfortable lives. What a lie and sham all civility is, all good breeding, all
culture and refinement, while one poor ragged wretch drags hungry on the earth!"

"But this is Socialism!" said Lewisham. "I--"

"No Ism," said Chaffery, raising his rich voice. "Only the ghastly truth of things--the truth
that the warp and the woof of the world of men is Lying. Socialism is no remedy, no ism is
a remedy; things are so."

"I don't agree--" began Lewisham.

"Not with the hopelessness, because you are young, but with the description you do."

"Well--within limits."

"You agree that most respectable positions in the world are tainted with the fraud of our social
conditions. If they were not tainted with fraud they would not be respectable. Even your own
position--Who gave you the right to marry and prosecute interesting scientific studies while
other young men rot in mines?"

"I admit--"

"You can't help admitting. And here is my position. Since all ways of life are tainted with
fraud, since to live and speak the truth is beyond human strength and courage--as one finds
it--is it not better for a man that he engage in some straightforward comparatively harmless
cheating, than if he risk his mental integrity in some ambiguous position and fall at last
into self-deception and self-righteousness? That is the essential danger. That is the thing
I always guard against. Heed that! It is the master sin.  Self-righteousness."

Mr. Lewisham pulled at his moustache.

"You begin to take me. And after all, these worthy people do not suffer so greatly. If I did
not take their money some other impostor would. Their huge conceit of intelligence would breed
perhaps some viler swindle than my facetious rappings. That's the line our doubting bishops
take, and why shouldn't I? For example, these people might give it to Public Charities, minister
to the fattened secretary, the prodigal younger son. After all, at worst, I am a sort of latter-day
Robin Hood; I take from the rich according to their incomes. I don't give to the poor certainly,
I don't get enough. But--there are other good works. Many a poor weakling have I comforted
with Lies, great thumping, silly Lies, about the grave! Compare me with one of those rascals
who disseminate phossy jaw and lead poisons, compare me with a millionaire who runs a music
hall with an eye to feminine talent, or an underwriter, or the common stockbroker. Or any sort
of lawyer....

"There are bishops," said Chaffery, "who believe in Darwin and doubt Moses. Now, I hold myself
better than they--analogous perhaps, but better--for I do at least invent something of the
tricks I play--I do do that."

"That's all very well," began Lewisham.

"I might forgive them their dishonesty," said Chaffery, "but the stupidity of it, the mental
self-abnegation--Lord! If a solicitor doesn't swindle in the proper shabby-magnificent way,
they chuck him for unprofessional conduct." He paused. He became meditative, and smiled faintly.

"Now, some of my dodges," he said with a sudden change of voice, turning towards Lewisham,
his eyes smiling over his glasses and an emphatic hand patting the table-cloth; "some of my
dodges are damned ingenious, you know--damned ingenious--and well worth double the money they
bring me--double."

He turned towards the fire again, pulling at his smouldering pipe, and eyeing Lewisham over
the corner of his glasses.

"One or two of my little things would make Maskelyne sit up," he said presently. "They would
set that mechanical orchestra playing out of pure astonishment. I really must explain some
of them to you--now we have intermarried."

It took Mr. Lewisham a minute or so to re-form the regiment of his mind, disordered by its
headlong pursuit of Chaffery's flying arguments. "But on your principles you might do almost
anything!" he said.

"Precisely!" said Chaffery.

"But--"

"It is rather a curious method," protested Chaffery; "to test one's principles of action by
judging the resultant actions on some other principle, isn't it?"

Lewisham took a moment to think. "I suppose that is so," he said, in the manner of a man convinced
against his will.

He perceived his logic insufficient. He suddenly thrust the delicacies of argument aside. Certain
sentences he had brought ready for use in his mind came up and he delivered them abruptly.
"Anyhow," he said, "I don't agree with this cheating. In spite of what you say, I hold to what
I said in my letter. Ethel's connexion with all these things is at an end. I shan't go out
of my way to expose you, of course, but if it comes in my way I shall speak my mind of all
these spiritualistic phenomena. It's just as well that we should know clearly where we are."

"That is clearly understood, my dear stepson-in-law," said Chaffery. "Our present object is
discussion."

"But Ethel--"

"Ethel is yours," said Chaffery. "Ethel is yours," he repeated after an interval and added
pensively--"to keep."

"But talking of Illusion," he resumed, dismissing the sordid with a sign of relief, "I sometimes
think with Bishop Berkeley, that all experience is probably something quite different from
reality. That consciousness is essentially hallucination. I, here, and you, and our talk--it
is all Illusion. Bring your Science to bear--what am I? A cloudy multitude of atoms, an infinite
interplay of little cells. Is this hand that I hold out me? This head? Is the surface of my
skin any more than a rude average boundary? You say it is my mind that is me? But consider
the war of motives. Suppose I have an impulse that I resist--it is I resist it--the impulse
is outside me, eh? But suppose that impulse carries me and I do the thing--that impulse is
part of me, is it not? Ah! My brain reels at these mysteries! Lord! what flimsy fluctuating
things we are--first this, then that, a thought, an impulse, a deed and a forgetting, and all
the time madly cocksure we are ourselves. And as for you--you who have hardly learned to think
for more than five or six short years, there you sit, assured, coherent, there you sit in all
your inherited original sin--Hallucinatory Windlestraw!--judging and condemning. You know Right
from Wrong! My boy, so did Adam and Eve ... so soon as they'd had dealings with the father
of lies!"

       *       *       *       *       *

At the end of the evening whisky and hot water were produced, and Chaffery, now in a mood of
great urbanity, said he had rarely enjoyed anyone's conversation so much as Lewisham's, and
insisted upon everyone having whisky. Mrs. Chaffery and Ethel added sugar and lemon. Lewisham
felt an instantaneous mild surprise at the sight of Ethel drinking grog.

At the door Mrs. Chaffery kissed Lewisham an effusive good-bye, and told Ethel she really believed
it was all for the best.

On the way home Lewisham was thoughtful and preoccupied. The problem of Chaffery assumed enormous
proportions. At times indeed even that good man's own philosophical sketch of himself as a
practical exponent of mental sincerity touched with humour and the artistic spirit, seemed
plausible. Lagune was an undeniable ass, and conceivably psychic research was an incentive
to trickery. Then he remembered the matter in his relation to Ethel....

"Your stepfather is a little hard to follow," he said at last, sitting on the bed and taking
off one boot. "He's dodgy--he's so confoundedly dodgy. One doesn't know where to take hold
of him. He's got such a break he's clean bowled me again and again."

He thought for a space, and then removed his boot and sat with it on his knee. "Of course!...
all that he said was wrong--quite wrong. Right is right and cheating is cheating, whatever
you say about it."

"That's what I feel about him," said Ethel at the looking-glass. "That's exactly how it seems
to me."

CHAPTER XXIV.

THE CAMPAIGN OPENS.

On Saturday Lewisham was first through the folding doors. In a moment he reappeared with a
document extended. Mrs. Lewisham stood arrested with her dress skirt in her hand, astonished
at the astonishment on his face. "I say!" said Lewisham; "just look here!"

She looked at the book that he held open before her, and perceived that its vertical ruling
betokened a sordid import, that its list of items in an illegible mixture of English and German
was lengthy. "1 kettle of coals 6d." occurred regularly down that portentous array and buttoned
it all together. It was Madam Gadow's first bill. Ethel took it out of his hand and examined
it closer. It looked no smaller closer. The overcharges were scandalous. It was curious how
the humour of calling a scuttle "kettle" had evaporated.

That document, I take it, was the end of Mr. Lewisham's informal honeymoon. Its advent was
the snap of that bright Prince Rupert's drop; and in a moment--Dust. For a glorious week he
had lived in the persuasion that life was made of love and mystery, and now he was reminded
with singular clearness that it was begotten of a struggle for existence and the Will to Live.
"Confounded imposition!" fumed Mr. Lewisham, and the breakfast table was novel and ominous,
mutterings towards anger on the one hand and a certain consternation on the other. "I must
give her a talking to this afternoon," said Lewisham at his watch, and after he had bundled
his books into the shiny black bag, he gave the first of his kisses that was not a distinct
and self-subsisting ceremony. It was usage and done in a hurry, and the door slammed as he
went his way to the schools. Ethel was not coming that morning, because by special request
and because she wanted to help him she was going to copy out some of his botanical notes which
had fallen into arrears.

On his way to the schools Lewisham felt something suspiciously near a sinking of the heart.
His preoccupation was essentially arithmetical. The thing that engaged his mind to the exclusion
of all other matters is best expressed in the recognised business form.

From this it will be manifest to the most unbusiness like that, disregarding the extraordinary
expenditure on the marriage, and the by no means final "few little things" Ethel had bought,
outgoings exceeded income by two pounds and more, and a brief excursion into arithmetic will
demonstrate that in five-and-twenty weeks the balance of the account would be nothing.

But that guinea a week was not to go on for five-and-twenty weeks, but simply for fifteen,
and then the net outgoings will be well over three guineas, reducing the "law" accorded our
young couple to two-and-twenty weeks. These details are tiresome and disagreeable, no doubt,
to the refined reader, but just imagine how much more disagreeable they were to Mr. Lewisham,
trudging meditative to the schools. You will understand his slipping out of the laboratory,
and betaking himself to the Educational Reading-room, and how it was that the observant Smithers,
grinding his lecture notes against the now imminent second examination for the "Forbes," was
presently perplexed to the centre of his being by the spectacle of Lewisham intent upon a pile
of current periodicals, the Educational Times, the Journal of Education, the Schoolmaster,
Science and Art, The University Correspondent, Nature, The Athenaeum, The Academy, and The Author.

Smithers remarked the appearance of a note-book, the jotting down of memoranda. He edged into
the bay nearest Lewisham's table and approached him suddenly from the flank. "What are you
after?" said Smithers in a noisy whisper and with a detective eye on the papers. He perceived
Lewisham was scrutinising the advertisement column, and his perplexity increased.

"Oh--nothing," said Lewisham blandly, with his hand falling casually over his memoranda; "what's
your particular little game?"

"Nothing much," said Smithers, "just mooching round. You weren't at the meeting last Friday?"

He turned a chair, knelt on it, and began whispering over the back about Debating Society politics.
Lewisham was inattentive and brief. What had he to do with these puerilities? At last Smithers
went away foiled, and met Parkson by the entrance. Parkson, by-the-bye, had not spoken to Lewisham
since their painful misunderstanding. He made a wide detour to his seat at the end table, and
so, and by a singular rectitude of bearing and a dignified expression, showed himself aware
of Lewisham's offensive presence.

Lewisham's investigations were two-fold. He wanted to discover some way of adding materially
to that weekly guinea by his own exertions, and he wanted to learn the conditions of the market
for typewriting. For himself he had a vague idea, an idea subsequently abandoned, that it was
possible to get teaching work in evening classes during the month of March. But, except by
reason of sadden death, no evening class in London changes its staff after September until
July comes round again. Private tuition, moreover, offered many attractions to him, but no
definite proposals. His ideas of his own possibilities were youthful or he would not have spent
time in noting the conditions of application for a vacant professorship in physics at the Melbourne
University. He also made a note of the vacant editorship of a monthly magazine devoted to social
questions. He would not have minded doing that sort of thing at all, though the proprietor
might. There was also a vacant curatorship in the Museum of Eton College.

The typewriting business was less varied and more definite. Those were the days before the
violent competition of the half-educated had brought things down to an impossible tenpence
the thousand words, and the prevailing price was as high as one-and-six. Calculating that Ethel
could do a thousand words in an hour and that she could work five or six hours in the day,
it was evident that her contributions to the household expenses would be by no means despicable;
thirty shillings a week perhaps. Lewisham was naturally elated at this discovery. He could
find no advertisements of authors or others seeking typewriting, but he saw that a great number
of typewriters advertised themselves in the literary papers. It was evident Ethel also must
advertise. "'Scientific phraseology a speciality' might be put," meditated Lewisham. He returned
to his lodgings in a hopeful mood with quite a bundle of memoranda of possible employments.
He spent five shillings in stamps on the way.

After lunch, Lewisham--a little short of breath-asked to see Madam Gadow. She came up in the
most affable frame of mind; nothing could be further from the normal indignation of the British
landlady. She was very voluble, gesticulatory and lucid, but unhappily bi-lingual, and at all
the crucial points German. Mr. Lewisham's natural politeness restrained him from too close
a pursuit across the boundary of the two imperial tongues. Quite half an hour's amicable discussion
led at last to a reduction of sixpence, and all parties professed themselves satisfied with
this result.

Madam Gadow was quite cool even at the end. Mr. Lewisham was flushed in the face, red-eared,
and his hair slightly disordered, but that sixpence was at any rate an admission of the justice
of his claim. "She was evidently trying it on," he said almost apologetically to Ethel. "It
was absolutely necessary to present a firm front to her. I doubt if we shall have any trouble
again....

"Of course what she says about kitchen coals is perfectly just."

Then the young couple went for a walk in Kensington Gardens, and--the spring afternoon was
so warm and pleasant--sat on two attractive green chairs near the band-stand, for which Lewisham
had subsequently to pay twopence. They had what Ethel called a "serious talk." She was really
wonderfully sensible, and discussed the situation exhaustively. She was particularly insistent
upon the importance of economy in her domestic disbursements and deplored her general ignorance
very earnestly. It was decided that Lewisham should get a good elementary text-book of domestic
economy for her private study. At home Mrs. Chaffery guided her house by the oracular items
of "Inquire Within upon Everything," but Lewisham considered that work unscientific.

Ethel was also of opinion that much might be learnt from the sixpenny ladies' papers--the penny
ones had hardly begun in those days. She had bought such publications during seasons of affluence,
but chiefly, as she now deplored, with an eye to the trimming of hats and such like vanities.
The sooner the typewriter came the better. It occurred to Lewisham with unpleasant suddenness
that he had not allowed for the purchase of a typewriter in his estimate of their resources.
It brought their "law" down to twelve or thirteen weeks.

They spent the evening in writing and copying a number of letters, addressing envelopes and
enclosing stamps. There were optimistic moments.

"Melbourne's a fine city," said Lewisham, "and we should have a glorious voyage out." He read
the application for the Melbourne professorship out loud to her, just to see how it read, and
she was greatly impressed by the list of his accomplishments and successes.

"I did not, know you knew half those things," she said, and became depressed at her relative
illiteracy. It was natural, after such encouragement, to write to the scholastic agents in
a tone of assured consequence.

The advertisement for typewriting in the Athenaeum troubled his conscience a little. After
he had copied out his draft with its "Scientific phraseology a speciality," fine and large,
he saw the notes she had written out for him. Her handwriting was still round and boyish, even
as it had appeared in the Whortley avenue, but her punctuation was confined to the erratic
comma and the dash, and there was a disposition to spell the imperfectly legible along the
line of least resistance. However, he dismissed that matter with a resolve to read over and
correct anything in that way that she might have sent her to do. It would not be a bad idea,
he thought parenthetically, if he himself read up some sound authority on the punctuation of
sentences.

They sat at this business quite late, heedless of the examination in botany that came on the
morrow. It was very bright and cosy in their little room with their fire burning, the gas lit
and the curtains drawn, and the number of applications they had written made them hopeful.
She was flushed and enthusiastic, now flitting about the room, now coming close to him and
leaning over him to see what he had done. At Lewisham's request she got him the envelopes from
the chest of drawers. "You are a help to a chap," said Lewisham, leaning back from the table,
"I feel I could do anything for a girl like you--anything."

"Really!" she cried, "Really! Am I really a help?"

Lewisham's face and gesture, were all assent. She gave a little cry of delight, stood for a
moment, and then by way of practical demonstration of her unflinching helpfulness, hurried
round the table towards him with arms extended, "You dear!" she cried.

Lewisham, partially embraced, pushed his chair back with his disengaged arm, so that she might
sit on his knee....

Who could doubt that she was a help?

CHAPTER XXV.

THE FIRST BATTLE.

Lewisham's inquiries for evening teaching and private tuition were essentially provisional
measures. His proposals for a more permanent establishment displayed a certain defect in his
sense of proportion. That Melbourne professorship, for example, was beyond his merits, and
there were aspects of things that would have affected the welcome of himself and his wife at
Eton College. At the outset he was inclined to regard the South Kensington scholar as the intellectual
salt of the earth, to overrate the abundance of "decent things" yielding from one hundred and
fifty to three hundred a year, and to disregard the competition of such inferior enterprises
as the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and the literate North. But the scholastic agents
to whom he went on the following Saturday did much in a quiet way to disabuse his mind.

Mr. Blendershin's chief assistant in the grimy little office in Oxford Street cleared up the
matter so vigorously that Lewisham was angered. "Headmaster of an endowed school, perhaps!"
said Mr. Blendershin's chief assistant "Lord!--why not a bishopric? I say,"--as Mr. Blendershin
entered smoking an assertive cigar--"one-and-twenty, no degree, no games, two years' experience
as junior--wants a headmastership of an endowed school!" He spoke so loudly that it was inevitable
the selection of clients in the waiting-room should hear, and he pointed with his pen.

"Look here!" said Lewisham hotly; "if I knew the ways of the market I shouldn't come to you."

Mr. Blendershin stared at Lewisham for a moment. "What's he done in the way of certificates?"
asked Mr. Blendershin of the assistant.

The assistant read a list of 'ologies and 'ographies. "Fifty resident," said Mr. Blendershin
concisely--"that's your figure. Sixty, if you're lucky."

"What?" said Mr. Lewisham.

"Not enough for you?"

"Not nearly."

"You can get a Cambridge graduate for eighty resident--and grateful," said Mr. Blendershin.

"But I don't want a resident post," said Lewisham.

"Precious few non-resident shops," said Mr. Blendershin. "Precious few. They want you for dormitory
supervision--and they're afraid of your taking pups outside."

"Not married by any chance?" said the assistant suddenly, after an attentive study of Lewisham's
face.

"Well--er." Lewisham met Mr. Blendershin's eye. "Yes," he said.

The assistant was briefly unprintable. "Lord! you'll have to keep that dark," said Mr. Blendershin.
"But you have got a tough bit of hoeing before you. If I was you I'd go on and get my degree
now you're so near it. You'll stand a better chance."

Pause.

"The fact is," said Lewisham slowly and looking at his boot toes, "I must be doing something
while I am getting my degree."

The assistant, whistled softly.

"Might get you a visiting job, perhaps," said Mr. Blendershin speculatively. "Just read me
those items again, Binks," He listened attentively. "Objects to religious teaching!--Eh?" He
stopped the reading by a gesture, "That's nonsense. You can't have everything, you know. Scratch
that out. You won't get a place in any middle-class school in England if you object to religious
teaching. It's the mothers--bless 'em! Say nothing about it. Don't believe--who does? There's
hundreds like you, you know--hundreds. Parsons--all sorts. Say nothing about it--"

"But if I'm asked?"

"Church of England. Every man in this country who has not dissented belongs to the Church of
England. It'll be hard enough to get you anything without that."

"But--" said Mr. Lewisham. "It's lying."

"Legal fiction," said Mr. Blendershin. "Everyone understands. If you don't do that, my dear
chap, we can't do anything for you. It's Journalism, or London docks. Well, considering your
experience,--say docks."

Lewisham's face flushed irregularly. He did not answer. He scowled and tugged at the still
by no means ample moustache.

"Compromise, you know," said Mr. Blendershin, watching him kindly. "Compromise."

For the first time in his life Lewisham faced the necessity of telling a lie in cold blood.
He glissaded from, the austere altitudes of his self-respect, and his next words were already
disingenuous.

"I won't promise to tell lies if I'm asked," he said aloud. "I can't do that."

"Scratch it out," said Blendershin to the clerk. "You needn't mention it. Then you don't say
you can teach drawing."

"I can't," said Lewisham.

"You just give out the copies," said Blendershin, "and take care they don't see you draw, you
know."

"But that's not teaching drawing--"

"It's what's understood by it in this country," said Blendershin. "Don't you go corrupting
your mind with pedagogueries. They're the ruin of assistants. Put down drawing. Then there's
shorthand--"

"Here, I say!" said Lewisham.

"There's shorthand, French, book-keeping, commercial geography, land measuring--"

"But I can't teach any of those things!"

"Look here," said Blendershin, and paused. "Has your wife or you a private income?"

"No," said Lewisham.

"Well?"

A pause of further moral descent, and a whack against an obstacle. "But they will find me out,"
said Lewisham.

Blendershin smiled. "It's not so much ability as willingness to teach, you know. And they won't
find you out. The sort of schoolmaster we deal with can't find anything out. He can't teach
any of these things himself--and consequently he doesn't believe they can be taught. Talk to
him of pedagogics and he talks of practical experience. But he puts 'em on his prospectus,
you know, and he wants 'em on his time-table. Some of these subjects--There's commercial geography,
for instance. What is commercial geography?"

"Barilla," said the assistant, biting the end of his pen, and added pensively, "and blethers."

"Fad," said Blendershin, "Just fad. Newspapers talk rot about commercial education, Duke of
Devonshire catches on and talks ditto--pretends he thought it himself--much he cares--parents
get hold of it--schoolmasters obliged to put something down, consequently assistants must.
And that's the end of the matter!"

"All right," said Lewisham, catching his breath in a faint sob of shame, "Stick 'em down. But
mind--a non-resident place."

"Well," said Blendershin, "your science may pull you through. But I tell you it's hard. Some
grant-earning grammar school may want that. And that's about all, I think. Make a note of the
address...."

The assistant made a noise, something between a whistle and the word "Fee." Blendershin glanced
at Lewisham and nodded doubtfully.

"Fee for booking," said the assistant; "half a crown, postage--in advance--half a crown."

But Lewisham remembered certain advice Dunkerley had given him in the old Whortley days. He
hesitated. "No," he said. "I don't pay that. If you get me anything there's the commission--if
you don't--"

"We lose," supplied the assistant.

"And you ought to," said Lewisham. "It's a fair game."

"Living in London?" asked Blendershin.

"Yes," said the clerk.

"That's all right," said Mr. Blendershin. "We won't say anything about the postage in that
case. Of course it's the off season, and you mustn't expect anything at present very much.
Sometimes there's a shift or so at Easter.... There's nothing more.... Afternoon. Anyone else,
Binks?"

Messrs. Maskelyne, Smith, and Thrums did a higher class of work than Blendershin, whose specialities
were lower class private establishments and the cheaper sort of endowed schools. Indeed, so
superior were Maskelyne, Smith, and Thrums that they enraged Lewisham by refusing at first
to put him on their books. He was interviewed briefly by a young man dressed and speaking with
offensive precision, whose eye adhered rigidly to the waterproof collar throughout the interview.

"Hardly our line," he said, and pushed Lewisham a form to fill up. "Mostly upper class and
good preparatory schools here, you know."

As Lewisham filled up the form with his multitudinous "'ologies" and "'ographies," a youth
of ducal appearance entered and greeted the precise young man in a friendly way. Lewisham,
bending down to write, perceived that this professional rival wore a very long frock coat,
patent leather boots, and the most beautiful grey trousers. His conceptions of competition
enlarged. The precise young man by a motion of his eyes directed the newcomer's attention to
Lewisham's waterproof collar, and was answered by raised eyebrows and a faint tightening of
the mouth. "That bounder at Castleford has answered me," said the new-comer in a fine rich
voice. "Is he any bally good?"

When the bounder at Castleford had been discussed Lewisham presented his paper, and the precise
young man with his eye still fixed on the waterproof collar took the document in the manner
of one who reaches across a gulf. "I doubt if we shall be able to do anything for you," he
said reassuringly. "But an English mastership may chance to be vacant. Science doesn't count
for much in our sort of schools, you know. Classics and good games--that's our sort of thing."

"I see," said Lewisham.

"Good games, good form, you know, and all that sort of thing."

"I see," said Lewisham.

"You don't happen to be a public-school boy?" asked the precise young man.

"No," said Lewisham.

"Where were you educated?"

Lewisham's face grew hot. "Does that matter?" he asked, with his eye on the exquisite grey
trousering.

"In our sort of school--decidedly. It's a question of tone, you know."

"I see," said Lewisham, beginning to realise new limitations. His immediate impulse was to
escape the eye of the nicely dressed assistant master. "You'll write, I suppose, if you have
anything," he said, and the precise young man responded with alacrity to his door-ward motion.

"Often get that kind of thing?" asked the nicely dressed young man when Lewisham had departed.

"Rather. Not quite so bad as that, you know. That waterproof collar--did you notice it? Ugh!
And--'I see.' And the scowl and the clumsiness of it. Of course he hasn't any decent clothes--he'd
go to a new shop with one tin box! But that sort of thing--and board school teachers--they're
getting everywhere! Only the other day--Rowton was here."

"Not Rowton of Pinner?"

"Yes, Rowton of Pinner. And he asked right out for a board schoolmaster. He said, 'I want someone
who can teach arithmetic.'"

He laughed. The nicely dressed young man meditated over the handle of his cane. "A bounder
of that kind can't have a particularly nice time," he said, "anyhow. If he does get into a
decent school, he must get tremendously cut by all the decent men."

"Too thick-skinned to mind that sort of thing, I fancy," said the scholastic agent. "He's a
new type. This South Kensington place and the polytechnics an turning him out by the hundred...."

Lewisham forgot his resentment at having to profess a religion he did not believe, in this
new discovery of the scholastic importance of clothing. He went along with an eye to all the
shop windows that afforded a view of his person. Indisputably his trousers were ungainly, flapping
abominably over his boots and bagging terribly at the knees, and his boots were not only worn
and ugly but extremely ill blacked. His wrists projected offensively from his coat sleeves,
he perceived a huge asymmetry in the collar of his jacket, his red tie was askew and ill tied,
and that waterproof collar! It was shiny, slightly discoloured, suddenly clammy to the neck.
What if he did happen to be well equipped for science teaching? That was nothing. He speculated
on the cost of a complete outfit. It would be difficult to get such grey trousers as those
he had seen for less than sixteen shillings, and he reckoned a frock coat at forty shillings
at least--possibly even more. He knew good clothes were very expensive. He hesitated at Poole's
door and turned away. The thing was out of the question. He crossed Leicester Square and went
down Bedford Street, disliking every well-dressed person he met.

Messrs. Danks and Wimborne inhabited a bank-like establishment near Chancery Lane, and without
any conversation presented him with forms to fill up. Religion? asked the form. Lewisham paused
and wrote "Church of England."

Thence he went to the College of Pedagogues in Holborn. The College of Pedagogues presented
itself as a long-bearded, corpulent, comfortable person with a thin gold watch chain and fat
hands. He wore gilt glasses and had a kindly confidential manner that did much to heal Lewisham's
wounded feelings. The 'ologies and 'ographies were taken down with polite surprise at their
number. "You ought to take one of our diplomas," said the stout man. "You would find no difficulty.
No competition. And there are prizes--several prizes--in money."

Lewisham was not aware that the waterproof collar had found a sympathetic observer.

"We give courses of lectures, and have an examination in the theory and practice of education.
It is the only examination in the theory and practice of education for men engaged in middle
and upper class teaching in this country. Except the Teacher's Diploma. And so few come--not
two hundred a year. Mostly governesses. The men prefer to teach by rule of thumb, you know.
English characteristic--rule of thumb. It doesn't do to say anything of course--but there's
bound to be--something happen--something a little disagreeable--somewhen if things go on as
they do. American schools keep on getting better--German too. What used to do won't do now.
I tell this to you, you know, but it doesn't do to tell everyone. It doesn't do. It doesn't
do to do anything. So much has to be considered. However ... But you'd do well to get a diploma
and make yourself efficient. Though that's looking ahead."

He spoke of looking ahead with an apologetic laugh as though it was an amiable weakness of
his. He turned from such abstruse matters and furnished Lewisham with the particulars of the
college diplomas, and proceeded to other possibilities. "There's private tuition," he said.
"Would you mind a backward boy? Then we are occasionally asked for visiting masters. Mostly
by girls' schools. But that's for older men--married men, you know."

"I am married," said Lewisham.

"Eh?" said the College of Pedagogues, startled.

"I am married," said Lewisham.

"Dear me," said the College of Pedagogues gravely, and regarding Mr. Lewisham over gold-rimmed
glasses. "Dear me! And I am more than twice your age, and I am not married at all. One-and-twenty!
Have you--have you been married long?"

"A few weeks," said Lewisham.

"That's very remarkable," said the College of Pedagogues. "Very interesting.... Really! Your
wife must be a very courageous young person.... Excuse me! You know--You will really have a
hard fight for a position. However--it certainly makes you eligible for girls' schools; it
does do that. To a certain extent, that is."

The evidently enhanced respect of the College of Pedagogues pleased Lewisham extremely. But
his encounter with the Medical, Scholastic, and Clerical Agency that holds by Waterloo Bridge
was depressing again, and after that he set out to walk home. Long before he reached home he
was tired, and his simple pride in being married and in active grapple with an unsympathetic
world had passed. His surrender on the religious question had left a rankling bitterness behind
it; the problem of the clothes was acutely painful. He was still far from a firm grasp of the
fact that his market price was under rather than over one hundred pounds a year, but that persuasion
was gaining ground in his mind.

The day was a greyish one, with a dull cold wind, and a nail in one of his boots took upon
itself to be objectionable. Certain wild shots and disastrous lapses in his recent botanical
examination, that he had managed to keep out of his mind hitherto, forced their way on his
attention. For the first time since his marriage he harboured premonitions of failure.

When he got in he wanted to sit down at once in the little creaky chair by the fire, but Ethel
came flitting from the newly bought typewriter with arms extended and prevented him. "Oh!--it
has been dull," she said.

He missed the compliment. "I haven't had such a giddy time that you should grumble," he said,
in a tone that was novel to her. He disengaged himself from her arms and sat down. He noticed
the expression of her face.

"I'm rather tired," he said by way of apology. "And there's a confounded nail I must hammer
down in my boot. It's tiring work hunting up these agents, but of course it's better to go
and see them. How have you been getting on?"

"All right," she said, regarding him. And then, "You are tired. We'll have some tea. And--let
me take off your boot for you, dear. Yes--I will."

She rang the bell, bustled out of the room, called for tea at the staircase, came back, pulled
out Madam Gadow's ungainly hassock and began unlacing his boot. Lewisham's mood changed. "You
are a trump, Ethel," he said; "I'm hanged if you're not." As the laces flicked he bent forward
and kissed her ear. The unlacing was suspended and there were reciprocal endearments....

Presently he was sitting in his slippers, with a cup of tea in his hand, and Ethel, kneeling
on the hearthrug with the firelight on her face, was telling him of an answer that had come
that afternoon to her advertisement in the Athenaeum.

"That's good," said Lewisham.

"It's a novelist," she said with the light of pride in her eyes, and handed him the letter.
"Lucas Holderness, the author of 'The Furnace of Sin' and other stories."

"That's first rate," said Lewisham with just a touch of envy, and bent forward to read by the
firelight.

The letter was from an address in Judd Street, Euston Road, written on good paper and in a
fair round hand such as one might imagine a novelist using. "Dear Madam," said the letter,
"I propose to send you, by registered letter, the MS. of a three-volume novel. It is about
90,000 words--but you must count the exact number."

"How I shall count I don't know," said Ethel.

"I'll show you a way," said Lewisham. "There's no difficulty in that. You count the words on
three or four pages, strike an average, and multiply."

"But, of course, before doing so I must have a satisfactory guarantee that my confidence in
putting my work in your hands will not be misplaced and that your execution is of the necessary
high quality."

"Oh!" said Lewisham; "that's a bother."

"Accordingly I must ask you for references."

"That's a downright nuisance," said Lewisham. "I suppose that ass, Lagune ... But what's this?
'Or, failing references, for a deposit ...' That's reasonable, I suppose."

It was such a moderate deposit too--merely a guinea. Even had the doubt been stronger, the
aspect of helpful hopeful little Ethel eager for work might well have thrust it aside. "Sending
him a cheque will show him we have a banking account behind us," said Lewisham,--his banking
was still sufficiently recent for pride. "We will send him a cheque. That'll settle him all right."

That evening after the guinea cheque had been despatched, things were further brightened by
the arrival of a letter of atrociously jellygraphed advices from Messrs. Danks and Wimborne.
They all referred to resident vacancies for which Lewisham was manifestly unsuitable, nevertheless
their arrival brought an encouraging assurance of things going on, of shifting and unstable
places in the defences of the beleaguered world. Afterwards, with occasional endearments for
Ethel, he set himself to a revision of his last year's note-books, for now the botany was finished,
the advanced zoological course--the last lap, as it were, for the Forbes medal--was beginning.
She got her best hat from the next room to make certain changes in the arrangement of its trimmings.
She sat in the little chair, while Lewisham, with documents spread before him, sat at the table.

Presently she looked up from an experimental arrangement of her cornflowers, and discovered
Lewisham, no longer reading, but staring blankly at the middle of the table-cloth, with an
extraordinary misery in his eyes. She forgot the cornflowers and stared at him.

"Penny," she said after an interval.

Lewisham started and looked up. "Eh?"

"Why were you looking so miserable?" she asked.

"Was I looking miserable?"

"Yes. And cross!"

"I was thinking just then that I would like to boil a bishop or so in oil."

"My dear!"

"They know perfectly well the case against what they teach, they know it's neither madness
nor wickedness nor any great harm, to others not to believe, they know perfectly well that
a man may be as honest as the day, and right--right and decent in every way--and not believe
in what they teach. And they know that it only wants the edge off a man's honour, for him to
profess anything in the way of belief. Just anything. And they won't say so. I suppose they
want the edge off every man's honour. If a man is well off they will truckle to him no end,
though he laughs at all their teaching. They'll take gold plate from company promoters and
rent from insanitary houses. But if a man is poor and doesn't profess to believe in what some
of them scarcely believe themselves, they wouldn't lift a finger to help him against the ignorance
of their followers. Your stepfather was right enough there. They know what's going on. They
know that it means lying and humbug for any number of people, and they don't care. Why should
they? They've got it down all right. They're spoilt, and why shouldn't we be?"

Lewisham having selected the bishops as scapegoats for his turpitude, was inclined to ascribe
even the nail in his boot to their agency.

Mrs. Lewisham looked puzzled. She realised his drift.

"You're not," she said, and dropped her voice, "an infidel?"

Lewisham nodded gloomily. "Aren't you?" he said.

"Oh no," said Mrs. Lewisham.

"But you don't go to church, you don't--"

"No, I don't," said Mrs. Lewisham; and then with more assurance, "But I'm not an infidel."

"Christian?"

"I suppose so."

"But a Christian--What do you believe?"

"Oh! to tell the truth, and do right, and not hurt or injure people and all that."

"That's not a Christian. A Christian is one who believes."

"It's what I mean by a Christian," said Mrs. Lewisham.

"Oh! at that rate anyone's a Christian," said Lewisham. "We all think it's right to do right
and wrong to do wrong."

"But we don't all do it," said Mrs. Lewisham, taking up the cornflowers again.

"No," said Lewisham, a little taken aback by the feminine method of discussion. "We don't all
do it--certainly." He stared at her for a moment--her head was a little on one side and her
eyes on the cornflower--and his mind was full of a strange discovery. He seemed on the verge
of speaking, and turned to his note-book again.

Very soon the centre of the table-cloth resumed its sway.

       *       *       *       *       *

The following day Mr. Lucas Holderness received his cheque for a guinea. Unhappily it was crossed.
He meditated for some time, and then took pen and ink and improved Lewisham's careless "one"
to "five" and touched up his unticked figure one to correspond.

You perceive him, a lank, cadaverous, good-looking man with long black hair and a semi-clerical
costume of quite painful rustiness. He made the emendations with grave carefulness. He took
the cheque round to his grocer. His grocer looked at it suspiciously.

"You pay it in," said Mr. Lucas Holderness, "if you've any doubts about it. Pay it in. I don't
know the man or what he is. He may be a swindler for all I can tell. I can't answer for him.
Pay it in and see. Leave the change till then. I can wait. I'll call round in a few days' time."

"All right, wasn't it?" said Mr. Lucas Holderness in a casual tone two days later.

"Quite, sir," said his grocer with enhanced respect, and handed him his four pounds thirteen
and sixpence change.

Mr. Lucas Holderness, who had been eyeing the grocer's stock with a curious intensity, immediately
became animated and bought a tin of salmon. He went out of the shop with the rest of the money
in his hand, for the pockets of his clothes were old and untrustworthy. At the baker's he bought
a new roll.

He bit a huge piece of the roll directly he was out of the shop, and went on his way gnawing.
It was so large a piece that his gnawing mouth was contorted into the ugliest shapes. He swallowed
by an effort, stretching his neck each time. His eyes expressed an animal satisfaction. He
turned the corner of Judd Street biting again at the roll, and the reader of this story, like
the Lewishams, hears of him no more.

CHAPTER XXVI.

THE GLAMOUR FADES.

After all, the rosy love-making and marrying and Epithalamy are no more than the dawn of things,
and to follow comes all the spacious interval of white laborious light. Try as we may to stay
those delightful moments, they fade and pass remorselessly; there is no returning, no recovering,
only--for the foolish--the vilest peep-shows and imitations in dens and darkened rooms. We
go on--we grow. At least we age. Our young couple, emerging presently from an atmosphere of
dusk and morning stars, found the sky gathering greyly overhead and saw one another for the
first time clearly in the light of every-day.

It might perhaps witness better to Lewisham's refinement if one could tell only of a moderated
and dignified cooling, of pathetic little concealments of disappointment and a decent maintenance
of the sentimental atmosphere. And so at last daylight. But our young couple were too crude
for that. The first intimations of their lack of identity have already been described, but
it would be tedious and pitiful to tell of all the little intensifications, shade by shade,
of the conflict of their individualities. They fell out, dear lady! they came to conflict of
words. The stress of perpetual worry was upon them, of dwindling funds and the anxious search
for work that would not come. And on Ethel lay long, vacant, lonely hours in dull surroundings.
Differences arose from the most indifferent things; one night Lewisham lay awake in unfathomable
amazement because she had convinced him she did not care a rap for the Welfare of Humanity,
and deemed his Socialism a fancy and an indiscretion. And one Sunday afternoon they started
for a walk under the pleasantest auspices, and returned flushed and angry, satire and retort
flying free--on the score of the social conventions in Ethel's novelettes. For some inexplicable
reason Lewisham saw fit to hate her novelettes very bitterly. These encounters indeed were
mere skirmishes for the most part, and the silences and embarrassments that followed ended
sooner or later in a "making up," tacit or definite, though once or twice this making up only
re-opened the healing wound. And always each skirmish left its scar, effaced from yet another
line of their lives the lingering tints of romantic colour.

There came no work, no added income for either of them, saving two trifles, for five long months.
Once Lewisham won twelve shillings in the prize competition of a penny weekly, and three times
came infinitesimal portions of typewriting from a poet who had apparently seen the Athenaeum
advertisement. His name was Edwin Peak Baynes and his handwriting was sprawling and unformed.
He sent her several short lyrics on scraps of paper with instructions that he desired "three
copies of each written beautifully in different styles" and "not fastened with metal fasteners
but with silk thread of an appropriate colour." Both of our young people were greatly exercised
by these instructions. One fragment was called "Bird Song," one "Cloud Shadows," and one "Eryngium,"
but Lewisham thought they might be spoken of collectively as Bosh. By way of payment, this
poet sent, in contravention of the postal regulations, half a sovereign stuck into a card,
asking her to keep the balance against future occasions. In a little while, greatly altered
copies of these lyrics were returned by the poet in person, with this enigmatical instruction
written across the cover of each: "This style I like, only if possible more so."

Lewisham was out, but Ethel opened the door, so this indorsement was unnecessary, "He's really
only a boy," said Ethel, describing the interview to Lewisham, who was curious. They both felt
that the youthfulness of Edwin Peak Baynes detracted something from the reality of this employment.

From his marriage until the final examination in June, Lewisham's life had an odd amphibious
quality. At home were Ethel and the perpetual aching pursuit of employment, the pelting irritations
of Madam Gadow's persistent overcharges, and so forth, and amid such things he felt extraordinarily
grown up; but intercalated with these experiences were those intervals at Kensington, scraps
of his adolescence, as it were, lying amidst the new matter of his manhood, intervals during
which he was simply an insubordinate and disappointing student with an increasing disposition
to gossip. At South Kensington he dwelt with theories and ideals as a student should; at the
little rooms in Chelsea--they grew very stuffy as the summer came on, and the accumulation
of the penny novelettes Ethel favoured made a litter--there was his particular private concrete
situation, and ideals gave place to the real.

It was a strangely narrow world, he perceived dimly, in which his manhood opened. The only
visitors were the Chafferys. Chaffery would come to share their supper, and won upon Lewisham
in spite of his roguery by his incessantly entertaining monologue and by his expressed respect
for and envy of Lewisham's scientific attainments. Moreover, as time went on Lewisham found
himself more and more in sympathy with Chaffery's bitterness against those who order the world.
It was good to hear him on bishops and that sort of people. He said what Lewisham wanted to
say beautifully. Mrs. Chaffery was perpetually flitting--out of the house as Lewisham came
home, a dim, black, nervous, untidy little figure. She came because Ethel, in spite of her
expressed belief that love was "all in all," found married life a little dull and lonely while
Lewisham was away. And she went hastily when he came, because of a certain irritability that
the struggle against the world was developing. He told no one at Kensington about his marriage,
at first because it was such a delicious secret, and then for quite other reasons. So there
was no overlapping. The two worlds began and ended sharply at the wrought-iron gates. But the
day came when Lewisham passed those gates for the last time and his adolescence ended altogether.

In the final examination of the biological course, the examination that signalised the end
of his income of a weekly guinea, he knew well enough that he had done badly. The evening of
the last day's practical work found him belated, hot-headed, beaten, with ruffled hair and
red ears. He sat to the last moment doggedly struggling to keep cool and to mount the ciliated
funnel of an earthworm's nephridium. But ciliated funnels come not to those who have shirked
the laboratory practice. He rose, surrendered his paper to the morose elderly young assistant
demonstrator who had welcomed him so flatteringly eight months before, and walked down the
laboratory to the door where the rest of his fellow-students clustered.

Smithers was talking loudly about the "twistiness" of the identification, and the youngster
with the big ears was listening attentively.

"Here's Lewisham! How did you get on, Lewisham?" asked Smithers, not concealing his assurance.

"Horribly," said Lewisham shortly, and pushed past.

"Did you spot D?" clamoured Smithers.

Lewisham pretended not to hear.

Miss Heydinger stood with her hat in her hand and looked at Lewisham's hot eyes. He was for
walking past her, but something in her face penetrated even his disturbance. He stopped.

"Did you get out the nephridium?" he said as graciously as he could.

She shook her head. "Are you going downstairs?" she asked.

"Rather," said Lewisham, with a vague intimation in his manner of the offence Smithers gave him.

He opened the glass door from the passage to the staircase. They went down one tier of that
square spiral in silence.

"Are you coming up again next year?" asked Miss Heydinger.

"No," said Lewisham. "No, I shall not come here again. Ever."

Pause. "What will you do?" she asked.

"I don't know. I have to get a living somehow. It's been bothering me all the session."

"I thought--" She stopped. "Will you go down to your uncle's again?" she said.

"No. I shall stop in London. It's no good going out of things into the country. And besides--I've
quarrelled rather with my uncle."

"What do you think of doing?--teaching?"

"I suppose it will be teaching, I'm not sure. Anything that turns up."

"I see," she said.

They went on down in silence for a time.

"I suppose you will come up again?" he asked.

"I may try the botanical again--if they can find room. And, I was thinking--sometimes one hears
of things. What is your address? So that if I heard of anything."

Lewisham stopped on the staircase and thought. "Of course," he said. He made no effort to give
her the address, and she demanded it again at the foot of the stairs.

"That confounded nephridium--!" he said. "It has put everything out of my head."

They exchanged addresses on leaflets torn from Miss Heydinger's little note-book.

She waited at the Book in the hall while he signed his name. At the iron gates of the Schools
she said: "I am going through Kensington Gardens."

He was now feeling irritated about the addresses, and he would not see the implicit invitation.
"I am going towards Chelsea."

She hesitated a moment, looking at him--puzzled. "Good-bye, then," she said.

"Good-bye," he answered, lifting his hat.

He crossed the Exhibition Road slowly with his packed glazed bag, now seamed with cracks, in
his hand. He went thoughtfully down to the corner of the Cromwell Road and turned along that
to the right so that he could see the red pile of the Science Schools rising fair, and tall
across the gardens of the Natural History Museum. He looked back towards it regretfully.

He was quite sure that he had failed in this last examination. He knew that any career as a
scientific man was now closed to him for ever. And he remembered now how he had come along
this very road to that great building for the first time in his life, and all the hopes and
resolves that had swelled within him as he had drawn near. That dream of incessant unswerving
work! Where might he have reached if only he had had singleness of purpose to realise that
purpose?...

And in these gardens it was that he and Smithers and Parkson had sat on a seat hard by the
fossil tree, and discoursed of Socialism together before the great paper was read....

"Yes," he said, speaking aloud to himself; "yes--that's all over too. Everything's over."

Presently the corner of the Natural History Museum came between him and his receding Alma Mater.
He sighed and turned his face towards the stuffy little rooms at Chelsea, and the still unconquered
world.

CHAPTER XXVII.

CONCERNING A QUARREL.

It was late in September that this particular quarrel occurred. Almost all the roseate tints
seemed gone by this time, for the Lewishams had been married six months. Their financial affairs
had changed from the catastrophic to the sordid; Lewisham had found work. An army crammer named
Captain Vigours wanted someone energetic for his mathematical duffers and to teach geometrical
drawing and what he was pleased to call "Sandhurst Science." He paid no less than two shillings
an hour for his uncertain demands on Lewisham's time. Moreover, there was a class in lower
mathematics beginning at Walham Green where Lewisham was to show his quality. Fifty shillings
a week or more seemed credible--more might be hoped for. It was now merely a case of tiding
over the interval until Vigours paid. And meanwhile the freshness of Ethel's blouses departed,
and Lewisham refrained from the repair of his boot which had cracked across the toe.

The beginning of the quarrel was trivial enough. But by the end they got to generalities. Lewisham
had begun the day in a bad temper and under the cloud of an overnight passage of arms--and
a little incident that had nothing to do with their ostensible difference lent it a warmth
of emotion quite beyond its merits. As he emerged through the folding doors he saw a letter
lying among the sketchily laid breakfast things, and Ethel's attitude suggested the recoil
of a quick movement; the letter suddenly dropped. Her eyes met his and she flushed. He sat
down and took the letter--a trifle awkwardly perhaps. It was from Miss Heydinger. He hesitated
with it halfway to his pocket, then decided to open it. It displayed an ample amount of reading,
and he read. On the whole he thought it rather a dull sort of letter, but he did not allow
this to appear. When it was read he put it carefully in his pocket.

That formally had nothing to do with the quarrel. The breakfast was already over when the quarrel
began. Lewisham's morning was vacant, and be proposed to occupy it in the revision of certain
notes bearing upon "Sandhurst Science." Unhappily the search for his note-book brought him
into collision with the accumulation of Ethel's novelettes.

"These things are everywhere," he said after a gust of vehement handling, "I wish you'd tidy
them up sometimes."

"They were tidy enough till you began to throw them about," Ethel pointed out.

"Confounded muck! it's only fit to be burnt," Lewisham remarked to the universe, and pitched
one viciously into the corner.

"Well, you tried to write one, anyhow," said Ethel, recalling a certain "Mammoth" packet of
note-paper that had come on an evil end before Lewisham found his industrial level. This reminiscence
always irritated him exceedingly.

"Eh?" he said sharply.

"You tried to write one," repeated Ethel--a little unwillingly.

"You don't mean me to forget that."

"It's you reminded me."

He stared hostility for a space.

"Well, the things make a beastly litter anyhow; there isn't a tidy corner anywhere in the room.
There never is."

"That's just the sort of thing you always say."

"Well--is there?"

"Yes, there is."

"Where?"

Ethel professed not to hear. But a devil had possession of Lewisham for a time. "It isn't as
though you had anything else to do," he remarked, wounding dishonourably.

Ethel turned. "If I put those things away," she said with tremendous emphasis on the "put,"
"you'd only say I'd hidden them. What is the good of trying to please you?"

The spirit of perversity suggested to Lewisham, "None apparently."

Ethel's cheeks glowed and her eyes were bright with unshed tears. Abruptly she abandoned the
defensive and blurted out the thing that had been latent so long between them. Her voice took
a note of passion. "Nothing I can do ever does please you, since that Miss Heydinger began
to write to you."

There was a pause, a gap. Something like astonishment took them both. Hitherto it had been
a convention that she knew nothing of the existence of Miss Heydinger. He saw a light. "How
did you know?" he began, and perceived that line was impossible. He took the way of the natural
man; he ejaculated an "Ugh!" of vast disgust, he raised his voice. "You are unreasonable!"
he cried in angry remonstrance. "Fancy saying that! As though you ever tried to please me!
Just as though it wasn't all the other way about!" He stopped--struck by a momentary perception
of injustice. He plunged at the point he had shirked, "How did you know it was Miss Heydinger--?"

Ethel's voice took upon itself the quality of tears. "I wasn't meant to know, was I?" she said.

"But how?"

"I suppose you think it doesn't concern me? I suppose you think I'm made of stone?"

"You mean--you think--?"

"Yes--I do."

For a brief interval Lewisham stared at the issue she had laid bare. He sought some crashing
proposition, some line of convincing reasoning, with which to overwhelm and hide this new aspect
of things. It would not come. He found himself fenced in on every side. A surging, irrational
rage seized upon him.

"Jealousy!" he cried. "Jealousy! Just as though--Can't I have letters about things you don't
understand--that you won't understand? If I asked you to read them you wouldn't--It's just
because--"

"You never give me a chance to understand."

"Don't I?"

"No!"

"Why!--At first I was always trying. Socialism, religion--all those things. But you don't care--you
won't care. You won't have that I've thought over these things at all, that I care for these
things! It wasn't any good to argue. You just care for me in a way--and all the rest of me--doesn't
matter! And because I've got a friend ..."

"Friend!"

"Yes--friend!"

"Why!--you hide her letters!"

"Because I tell you you wouldn't understand what they are about. But, pah! I won't argue. I
won't! You're jealous, and there's the end of the matter!"

"Well, who wouldn't be jealous?"

He stared at her as if he found the question hard to see. The theme was difficult--invincibly
difficult. He surveyed the room for a diversion. The note-book he had disinterred from her
novelettes lay upon the table and reminded him of his grievance of rained hours. His rage exploded.
He struck out abruptly towards fundamental things. He gesticulated forcibly. "This can't go
on!" he cried, "this can't go on! How can I work? How can I do anything?"

He made three steps and stood in a clear space.

"I won't stand, it--I won't go on at this! Quarrels--bickerings--discomfort. Look there! I
meant to work this morning. I meant to look up notes! Instead of which you start a quarrel--"

The gross injustice raised Ethel's voice to an outcry. "I didn't start the quarrel--"

The only response to this was to shout, and Lewisham shouted. "You start a quarrel!" he repeated.
"You make a shindy! You spring a dispute--jealousy!--on me! How can I do anything? How can
one stop in a house like this? I shall go out. Look here!--I shall go out. I shall go to Kensington
and work there!"

He perceived himself wordless, and Ethel was about to speak. He glared about him, seeking a
prompt climax. Instant action was necessary. He perceived Huxley's Vertebrata upon the side-table.
He clutched it, swayed it through a momentous arc, hurled it violently into the empty fireplace.

For a second he seemed to be seeking some other missile. He perceived his hat on the chest
of drawers, seized it, and strode tragically from the room.

He hesitated with the door half closed, then opened it wide and slammed it vehemently. Thereby
the world was warned of the justice of his rage, and so he passed with credit into the street.

He went striding heedless of his direction through the streets dotted with intent people hurrying
to work, and presently habit turned his feet towards the Brompton Road. The eastward trend
of the morning traffic caught him. For a time, save for a rebellious ingredient of wonder at
the back of his mind, he kept his anger white and pure. Why had he married her? was the text
to which he clung. Why in the name of destiny had he married her? But anyhow he had said the
decisive thing. He would not stand it! It must end. Things were intolerable and they must end.
He meditated devastating things that he might presently say to her in pursuance of this resolution.
He contemplated acts of cruelty. In such ways he would demonstrate clearly that he would not
stand it. He was very careful to avoid inquiring what it was he would not stand.

How in the name of destiny had he come to marry her? The quality of his surroundings mingled
in some way with the quality of his thoughts. The huge distended buildings of corrugated iron
in which the Art Museum (of all places!) culminates, the truncated Oratory all askew to the
street, seemed to have a similar quarrel with fate. How in the name of destiny? After such
high prolusions!

He found that his thoughts had carried him past the lodge of the museum. He turned back irritably
and went through the turnstile. He entered the museum and passed beneath the gallery of Old
Iron on his way to the Education Library. The vacant array of tables, the bays of attendant
books had a quality of refuge....

So much for Lewisham in the morning. Long before midday all the vigour of his wrath was gone,
all his passionate conviction of Ethel's unworthiness. Over a pile of neglected geological
works he presented a face of gloom. His memory presented a picture of himself as noisy, overbearing,
and unfair. What on earth had it all been about?

By two o'clock he was on his way to Vigours', and his mood was acute remorse. Of the transition
there can be no telling in words, for thoughts are more subtle than words and emotions infinitely
vaguer. But one thing at least is definite, that a memory returned.

It drifted in to him, through the glass roof of the Library far above. He did not perceive
it as a memory at first, but as an irritating obstacle to attention. He struck the open pages
of the book before him with his flat hand. "Damn that infernal hurdy-gurdy!"  he whispered.

Presently he made a fretful movement and put his hands over his ears.

Then he thrust his books from him, got up, and wandered about the Library. The organ came to
an abrupt end in the middle of a bar, and vanished in the circumambient silence of space.

Lewisham standing in a bay closed a book with a snap and returned to his seat.

Presently he found himself humming a languid tune, and thinking again of the quarrel that he
had imagined banished from his mind. What in the name of destiny had it all been about? He
had a curious sense that something had got loose, was sliding about in his mind. And as if
by way of answer emerged a vision of Whortley--a singularly vivid vision. It was moonlight
and a hillside, the little town lay lit and warm below, and the scene was set to music, a lugubriously
sentimental air. For some reason this music had the quality of a barrel organ--though he knew
that properly it came from a band--and it associated with itself a mystical formula of words,
drawing words:--

    "Sweet dreamland fa--ces, passing to and fro,
    Bring back to mem'ry days of long ago--oh!"

This air not only reproduced the picture with graphic vividness, but it trailed after it an
enormous cloud of irrational emotion, emotion that had but a moment before seemed gone for
ever from his being.

He recalled it all! He had come down that hillside and Ethel had been with him....

Had he really felt like that about her?

"Pah!" he said suddenly, and reverted to his books.

But the tune and the memory had won their footing, they were with him through his meagre lunch
of milk and scones--he had resolved at the outset he would not go back to her for the midday
meal--and on his way to Vigours' they insisted on attention. It may be that lunching on scone
and milk does in itself make for milder ways of thinking. A sense of extraordinary contradiction,
of infinite perplexity, came to him.

"But then," he asked, "how the devil did we get to this?"

Which is indeed one of the fundamental questions of matrimony.

The morning tumults had given place to an almost scientific calm. Very soon he was grappling
manfully with the question. There was no disputing it, they had quarrelled. Not once but several
times lately they had quarrelled. It was real quarrelling;--they had stood up against one another,
striking, watching to strike, seeking to wound. He tried to recall just how things had gone--what
he had said and what she had replied. He could not do it. He had forgotten phrases and connexions.
It stood in his memory not as a sequence of events but as a collection of disconnected static
sayings; each saying blunt, permanent, inconsecutive like a graven inscription. And of the
scene there came only one picture--Ethel with a burning face and her eyes shining with tears.

The traffic of a cross street engaged him for a space. He emerged on the further side full
of the vivid contrast of their changed relations. He made a last effort to indict her, to show
that for the transition she was entirely to blame. She had quarrelled with him, she had quarrelled
deliberately because she was jealous. She was jealous of Miss Heydinger because she was stupid.
But now these accusations faded like smoke as he put them forth. But the picture of two little
figures back there in the moonlit past did not fade. It was in the narrows of Kensington High
Street that he abandoned her arraignment. It was beyond the Town Hall that he made the new
step. Was it, after all, just possible that in some degree he himself rather was the chief
person to blame?

It was instantly as if he had been aware of that all the time.

Once he had made that step, he moved swiftly. Not a hundred paces before the struggle was over,
and he had plunged headlong into the blue abyss of remorse. And all these things that had been
so dramatic and forcible, all the vivid brutal things he had said, stood no longer graven inscriptions
but in letters of accusing flame. He tried to imagine he had not said them, that his memory
played him a trick; tried to suppose he had said something similar perhaps, but much less forcible.
He attempted with almost equal futility to minimise his own wounds. His endeavour served only
to measure the magnitude of his fall.

He had recovered everything now, he saw it all. He recalled Ethel, sunlit in the avenue, Ethel,
white in the moonlight before they parted outside the Frobisher house, Ethel as she would come
out of Lagune's house greeting him for their nightly walk, Ethel new wedded, as she came to
him through the folding doors radiant in the splendour his emotions threw about her. And at
last, Ethel angry, dishevelled and tear-stained in that ill-lit, untidy little room. All to
the cadence of a hurdy-gurdy tune! From that to this! How had it been possible to get from
such an opalescent dawning to such a dismal day? What was it had gone? He and she were the
same two persons who walked so brightly in his awakened memory; he and she who had lived so
bitterly through the last few weeks of misery!

His mood sank for a space to the quality of groaning. He implicated her now at most as his
partner in their failure--"What a mess we have made of things!" was his new motif. "What a mess!"

He knew love now for what it was, knew it for something more ancient and more imperative than
reason. He knew now that he loved her, and his recent rage, his hostility, his condemnation
of her seemed to him the reign of some exterior influence in his mind. He thought incredulously
of the long decline in tenderness that had followed the first days of their delight in each
other, the diminution of endearment, the first yielding to irritability, the evenings he had
spent doggedly working, resisting all his sense of her presence. "One cannot always be love-making,"
he had said, and so they were slipping apart. Then in countless little things he had not been
patient, he had not been fair. He had wounded her by harshness, by unsympathetic criticism,
above all by his absurd secrecy about Miss Heydinger's letters. Why on earth had he kept those
letters from her? as though there was something to hide! What was there to hide? What possible
antagonism could there be? Yet it was by such little things that their love was now like some
once valued possession that had been in brutal hands, it was scratched and chipped and tarnished,
it was on its way to being altogether destroyed. Her manner had changed towards him, a gulf
was opening that he might never be able to close again.

"No, it shall not be!" he said, "it shall not be!"

But how to get back to the old footing? how to efface the things he had said, the things that
had been done?

Could they get back?

For a moment he faced a new possibility. Suppose they could not get back! Suppose the mischief
was done! Suppose that when he slammed the door behind him it locked, and was locked against
him for ever!

"But we must!" said Lewisham, "we must!"

He perceived clearly that this was no business of reasoned apologies. He must begin again,
he must get back to emotion, he must thrust back the overwhelming pressure of everyday stresses
and necessities that was crushing all the warmth and colour from their lives. But how? How?

He must make love to her again. But how to begin--how to mark the change? There had been making-up
before, sullen concessions and treaties. But this was different. He tried to imagine something
he might say, some appeal that he might make. Everything he thought of was cold and hard, or
pitiful and undignified, or theatrical and foolish. Suppose the door was closed! If already
it was too late! In every direction he was confronted by the bristling memories of harsh things.
He had a glimpse of how he must have changed in her eyes, and things became intolerable for
him. For now he was assured he loved her still with all his heart.

And suddenly came a florist's window, and in the centre of it a glorious heap of roses.

They caught his eye before they caught his mind. He saw white roses, virginal white, roses
of cream and pink and crimson, the tints of flesh and pearl, rich, a mass of scented colour,
visible odours, and in the midst of them a note of sullen red. It was as it were the very colour
of his emotion. He stopped abruptly. He turned back to the window and stared frankly. It was
gorgeous, he saw, but why so particularly did it appeal to him?

Then he perceived as though it was altogether self-evident what he had to do. This was what
he wanted. This was the note he had to strike. Among other things because it would repudiate
the accursed worship of pinching self-restraint that was one of the incessant stresses between
them. They would come to her with a pure unexpectedness, they would flame upon her.

Then, after the roses, he would return.

Suddenly the grey trouble passed from his mind; he saw the world full of colour again. He saw
the scene he desired bright and clear, saw Ethel no longer bitter and weeping, but glad as
once she had always seemed glad. His heart-beats quickened. It was giving had been needed,
and he would give.

Some weak voice of indiscreet discretion squeaked and vanished. He had, he knew, a sovereign
in his pocket. He went in.

He found himself in front of a formidable young lady in black, and unprepared with any formula.
He had never bought flowers before. He looked about him for an inspiration. He pointed at the
roses. "I want those roses," he said....

He emerged again with only a few small silver coins remaining out of the sovereign he had changed.
The roses were to go to Ethel, properly packed; they were to be delivered according to his
express direction at six o'clock.

"Six o'clock," Lewisham had reiterated very earnestly.

"We quite understand," the young lady in black had said, and had pretended to be unable to
conceal a smile. "We're quite accustomed to sending out flowers."

CHAPTER XXVIII.

THE COMING OF THE ROSES.

And the roses miscarried!

When Lewisham returned from Vigours' it was already nearly seven. He entered the house with
a beating heart. He had expected to find Ethel excited, the roses displayed. But her face was
white and jaded. He was so surprised by this that the greeting upon his lips died away. He
was balked! He went into, the sitting-room and there were no roses to be seen. Ethel came past
him and stood with her back to him looking out of the window. The suspense was suddenly painful....

He was obliged to ask, though he was certain of the answer, "Has nothing come?"

Ethel looked at him. "What did you think had come?"

"Oh! nothing."

She looked out of the window again. "No," she said slowly, "nothing has come."

He tried to think of something to say that might bridge the distance between them, but he could
think of nothing. He must wait until the roses came. He took out his books and a gaunt hour
passed to supper time. Supper was a chilly ceremonial set with necessary over-polite remarks.
Disappointment and exasperation darkened Lewisham's soul. He began to feel angry with everything--even
with her--he perceived she still judged him angry, and that made him angry with her. He was
resuming his books and she was helping Madam Gadow's servant to clear away, when they heard
a rapping at the street door. "They have come at last," he said to himself brightening, and
hesitated whether he should bolt or witness her reception of them. The servant was a nuisance.
Then he heard Chaffery's voices and whispered a soft "damn!" to himself.

The only thing to do now if the roses came was to slip out into the passage, intercept them,
and carry them into the bedroom by the door between that and the passage. It would be undesirable
for Chaffery to witness that phase of sentiment. He might flash some dart of ridicule that
would stick in their memory for ever.

Lewisham tried to show that he did not want a visitor. But Chaffery was in high spirits, and
could have warmed a dozen cold welcomes. He sat down without any express invitation in the
chair that he preferred.

Before Mr. and Mrs. Chaffery the Lewishams veiled whatever trouble might be between them beneath
an insincere cordiality, and Chaffery was soon talking freely, unsuspicious of their crisis.
He produced two cigars. "I had a wild moment," he said. "'For once,' said I, 'the honest shall
smoke the admirable--or the admirable shall smoke the honest,' whichever you like best. Try
one? No? Those austere principles of yours! There will be more pleasure then. But really, I
would as soon you smoked it as I. For to-night I radiate benevolence."

He cut the cigar with care, he lit it with ceremony, waiting until nothing but honest wood
was burning on the match, and for fully a minute he was silent, evolving huge puffs of smoke.
And then he spoke again, punctuating his words by varied and beautiful spirals. "So far," he
said, "I have only trifled with knavery."

As Lewisham said nothing he resumed after a pause.

"There are three sorts of men in the world, my boy, three and no more--and of women only one.
There are happy men and there are knaves and fools. Hybrids I don't count. And to my mind knaves
and fools are very much alike."

He paused again.

"I suppose they are," said Lewisham flatly, and frowned at the fireplace.

Chaffery eyed him. "I am talking wisdom. To-night I am talking a particular brand of wisdom.
I am broaching some of my oldest and finest, because--as you will find one day--this is a special
occasion. And you are distrait!"

Lewisham looked up. "Birthday?" he said.

"You will see. But I was making golden observations about knaves and fools. I was early convinced
of the absolute necessity of righteousness if a man is to be happy. I know it as surely as
there is a sun in the heavens. Does that surprise you?"

"Well, it hardly squares--"

"No. I know. I will explain all that. But let me tell you the happy life. Let me give you that,
as if I lay on my deathbed and this was a parting gift. In the first place, mental integrity.
Prove all things, hold fast to that which is right. Let the world have no illusions for you,
no surprises. Nature is full of cruel catastrophes, man is a physically degenerate ape, every
appetite, every instinct, needs the curb; salvation is not in the nature of things, but whatever
salvation there may be is in the nature of man; face all these painful things. I hope you follow
that?"

"Go on," said Lewisham, with the debating-society taste for a thesis prevailing for a minute
over that matter of the roses.

"In youth, exercise and learning; in adolescence, ambition; and in early manhood, love--no
footlight passion." Chaffery was very solemn and insistent, with a lean extended finger, upon
this point.

"Then marriage, young and decent, and then children and stout honest work for them, work too
for the State in which they live; a life of self-devotion, indeed, and for sunset a decent
pride--that is the happy life. Rest assured that is the happy life; the life Natural Selection
has been shaping for man since life began. So a man may go happy from the cradle to the grave--at
least--passably happy. And to do this needs just three things--a sound body, a sound intelligence,
and a sound will ... A sound will."

Chaffery paused on the repetition.

"No other happiness endures. And when all men are wise, all men will seek that life. Fame!
Wealth! Art!--the Red Indians worship lunatics, and we are still by way of respecting the milder
sorts. But I say that all men who do not lead that happy life are knaves and fools. The physical
cripple, you know, poor devil, I count a sort of bodily fool."

"Yes," weighed Lewisham, "I suppose he is."

"Now a fool fails of happiness because of his insufficient mind, he miscalculates, he stumbles
and hobbles, some cant or claptrap whirls him away; he gets passion out of a book and a wife
out of the stews, or he quarrels on a petty score; threats frighten him, vanity beguiles him,
he fails by blindness. But the knave who is not a fool fails against the light. Many knaves
are fools also--most are--but some are not. I know--I am a knave but no fool. The essence of
your knave is that he lacks the will, the motive capacity to seek his own greater good. The
knave abhors persistence. Strait is the way and narrow the gate; the knave cannot keep to it
and the fool cannot find it."

Lewisham lost something of what Chaffery was saying by reason of a rap outside. He rose, but
Ethel was before him. He concealed his anxiety as well as he could; and was relieved when he
heard the front door close again and her footsteps pass into the bedroom by the passage door.
He reverted to Chaffery.

"Has it ever occurred to you," asked Chaffery, apparently apropos of nothing, "that intellectual
conviction is no motive at all? Any more than a railway map will run a train a mile."

"Eh?" said Lewisham. "Map--run a train a mile--of course, yes. No, it won't."

"That is precisely my case," said Chaffery. "That is the case of your pure knave everywhere.
We are not fools--because we know. But yonder runs the highway, windy, hard, and austere, a
sort of dry happiness that will endure; and here is the pleasant by-way--lush, my boy, lush,
as the poets have it, and with its certain man-trap among the flowers ..."

Ethel returned through the folding doors. She glanced at Lewisham, remained standing for awhile,
sat down in the basket chair as if to resume some domestic needlework that lay upon the table,
then rose and went back into the bedroom.

Chaffery proceeded to expatiate on the transitory nature of passion and all glorious and acute
experiences. Whole passages of that discourse Lewisham did not hear, so intent was he upon
those roses. Why had Ethel gone back into the bedroom? Was it possible--? Presently she returned,
but she sat down so that he could not see her face.

"If there is one thing to set against the wholesome life it is adventure," Chaffery was saying. In england

"There is but little light, and portable property in that house in Clapham that has escaped
my lamentable improvidence, but there are one or two things--the iron-bound chest, the bureau
with a broken hinge, and the large air pump--distinctly pawnable if only you can contrive to
get them to a pawnshop. You have more Will power than I--I never could get the confounded things
downstairs. That iron-bound box was originally mine, before I married your mother-in-law, so
that I am not altogether regardless of your welfare and the necessity of giving some equivalent.
Don't judge me too harshly."

Lewisham turned over sharply without finishing that page.

"My life at Clapham," continued the letter, "has irked me for some time, and to tell you the
truth, the spectacle of your vigorous young happiness--you are having a very good time, you
know, fighting the world--reminded me of the passing years. To be frank in self-criticism,
there is more than a touch of the New Woman about me, and I feel I have still to live my own
life. What a beautiful phrase that is--to live one's own life!--redolent of honest scorn for
moral plagiarism. No Imitatio Christi in that ... I long to see more of men and cities....
I begin late, I know, to live my own life, bald as I am and grey-whiskered; but better late
than never. Why should the educated girl have the monopoly of the game? And after all, the
whiskers will dye....

"There are things--I touch upon them lightly--that will presently astonish Lagune." Lewisham
became more attentive. "I marvel at that man, grubbing hungry for marvels amidst the almost
incredibly marvellous. What can be the nature of a man who gapes after Poltergeists with the
miracle of his own silly existence (inconsequent, reasonless, unfathomably weird) nearer to
him than breathing and closer than hands and feet. What is he for, that he should wonder at
Poltergeists? I am astonished these by no means flimsy psychic phenomena do not turn upon their
investigators, and that a Research Society of eminent illusions and hallucinations does not
pursue Lagune with sceptical! inquiries. Take his house--expose the alleged man of Chelsea!
A priori they might argue that a thing so vain, so unmeaning, so strongly beset by cackle,
could only be the diseased imagining of some hysterical phantom. Do you believe that such a
thing as Lagune exists? I must own to the gravest doubts. But happily his banker is of a more
credulous type than I.... Of all that Lagune will tell you soon enough."

Lewisham read no more. "I suppose he thought himself clever when he wrote that rot," said Lewisham
bitterly, throwing the sheets forcibly athwart the table. "The simple fact is, he's stolen,
or forged, or something--and bolted."

There was a pause. "What will become of Mother?" said Ethel.

Lewisham looked at Mother and thought for a moment. Then he glanced at Ethel.

"We're all in the same boat," said Lewisham.

"I don't want to give any trouble to a single human being," said Mrs. Chaffery.

"I think you might get a man his tea, Ethel," said Lewisham, sitting down suddenly; "anyhow."
He drummed on the table with his fingers. "I have to get to Walham Green by a quarter to seven."

"We're all in the same boat," he repeated after an interval, and continued drumming. He was
chiefly occupied by the curious fact that they were all in the same boat. What an extraordinary
faculty he had for acquiring responsibility! He looked up suddenly and caught Mrs. Chaffery's
tearful eye directed to Ethel and full of distressful interrogation, and his perplexity was
suddenly changed to pity. "It's all right, Mother," he said. "I'm not going to be unreasonable.
I'll stand by you."

"Ah!" said Mrs. Chaffery. "As if I didn't know!" and Ethel came and kissed him.

He seemed in imminent danger of universal embraces.

"I wish you'd let me have my tea," he said. And while he had his tea he asked Mrs. Chaffery
questions and tried to get the new situation into focus.

But even at ten o'clock, when he was returning hot and jaded from Walham Green, he was still
trying to get the situation into focus. There were vague ends and blank walls of interrogation
in the matter, that perplexed him.

He knew that his supper would be only the prelude to an interminable "talking over," and indeed
he did not get to bed until nearly two. By that time a course of action was already agreed
upon. Mrs. Chaffery was tied to the house in Clapham by a long lease, and thither they must
go. The ground floor and first floor were let unfurnished, and the rent of these practically
paid the rent of the house. The Chafferys occupied basement and second floor. There was a bedroom
on the second floor, formerly let to the first floor tenants, that he and Ethel could occupy,
and in this an old toilet table could be put for such studies as were to be prosecuted at home.
Ethel could have her typewriter in the subterranean breakfast-room. Mrs. Chaffery and Ethel
must do the catering and the bulk of the housework, and as soon as possible, since letting
lodgings would not square with Lewisham's professional pride, they must get rid of the lease
that bound them and take some smaller and more suburban residence. If they did that without
leaving any address it might save their feelings from any return of the prodigal Chaffery.

Mrs. Chaffery's frequent and pathetic acknowledgments of Lewisham's goodness only partly relieved
his disposition to a philosophical bitterness. And the practical issues were complicated by
excursions upon the subject of Chaffery, what he might have done, and where he might have gone,
and whether by any chance he might not return.

When at last Mrs. Chaffery, after a violent and tearful kissing and blessing of them both--they
were "good dear children," she said--had departed, Mr. and Mrs. Lewisham returned into their
sitting-room. Mrs. Lewisham's little face was enthusiastic. "You're a Trump," she said, extending
the willing arms that were his reward. "I know," she said, "I know, and all to-night I have
been loving you. Dear! Dear! Dear...."

The next day Lewisham was too full of engagements to communicate with Lagune, but the following
morning he called and found the psychic investigator busy with the proofs of Hesperus. He welcomed
the young man cordially nevertheless, conceiving him charged with the questions that had been
promised long ago--it was evident he knew nothing of Lewisham's marriage. Lewisham stated his
case with some bluntness.

"He was last here on Saturday," said Lagune. "You have always been inclined to suspicion about
him. Have you any grounds?"

"You'd better read this," said Lewisham, repressing a grim smile, and he handed Lagune Chaffery's
letter.

He glanced at the little man ever and again to see if he had come to the personal portion,
and for the rest of the time occupied himself with an envious inventory of the writing appointments
about him. No doubt the boy with the big ears had had the same sort of thing ...

When Lagune came to the question of his real identity he blew out his cheeks in the most astonishing
way, but made no other sign.

"Dear, dear!" he said at last. "My bankers!"

He looked at Lewisham with the exaggerated mildness of his spectacled eye. "What do you think
it means?" he asked. "Has he gone mad? We have been conducting some experiments involving--considerable
mental strain. He and I and a lady. Hypnotic--"

"I should look at my cheque-book if I were you."

Lagune produced some keys and got out his cheque book. He turned over the counterfoils. "There's
nothing wrong here," he said, and handed the book to Lewisham.

"Um," said Lewisham. "I suppose this--I say, is this right?"

He handed back the book to Lagune, open at the blank counterfoil of a cheque that had been
removed. Lagune stared and passed his hand over his forehead in a confused way. "I can't see
this," he said.

Lewisham had never heard of post hypnotic suggestion and he stood incredulous. "You can't see
that?" he said. "What nonsense!"

"I can't see it," repeated Lagune.

For some seconds Lewisham could not get away from stupid repetitions of his inquiry. Then he
hit upon a collateral proof. "But look here! Can you see this counterfoil?"

"Plainly," said Lagune.

"Can you read the number?"

"Five thousand two hundred and seventy-nine."

"Well, and this?"

"Five thousand two hundred and eighty-one."

"Well--where's five thousand two hundred and eighty?"

Lagune began to look uncomfortable. "Surely," he said, "he has not--Will you read it out--the
cheque, the counterfoil I mean, that I am unable to see?"

"It's blank," said Lewisham with an irresistible grin.

"Surely," said Lagune, and the discomfort of his expression deepened. "Do you mind if I call
in a servant to confirm--?"

Lewisham did not mind, and the same girl who had admitted him to the séance appeared. When
she had given her evidence she went again. As she left the room by the door behind Lagune her
eyes met Lewisham's, and she lifted her eyebrows, depressed her mouth, and glanced at Lagune
with a meaning expression.

"I'm afraid," said Lagune, "that I have been shabbily treated. Mr. Chaffery is a man of indisputable
powers--indisputable powers; but I am afraid--I am very much afraid he has abused the conditions
of the experiment. All this--and his insults--touch me rather nearly."

He paused. Lewisham rose. "Do you mind if you come again?" asked Lagune with gentle politeness.

Lewisham was surprised to find himself sorry.

"He was a man of extraordinary gifts," said Lagune. "I had come to rely upon him.... My cash
balance has been rather heavy lately. How he came to know of that I am unable to say. Without
supposing, that is, that he had very remarkable gifts."

When Lewisham saw Lagune again he learnt the particulars of Chaffery's misdeed and the additional
fact that the "lady" had also disappeared. "That's a good job," he remarked selfishly. "There's
no chance of his coming back." He spent a moment trying to imagine the "lady"; he realised
more vividly than he had ever done before the narrow range of his experience, the bounds of
his imagination. These people also--with grey hair and truncated honour--had their emotions
I Even it may be glowing! He came back to facts. Chaffery had induced Lagune when hypnotised
to sign a blank cheque as an "autograph." "The strange thing is," explained Lagune, "it's doubtful
if he's legally accountable. The law is so peculiar about hypnotism and I certainly signed
the cheque, you know."

The little man, in spite of his losses, was now almost cheerful again on account of a curious
side issue. "You may say it is coincidence," he said, "you may call it a fluke, but I prefer
to look for some other interpretation! Consider this. The amount of my balance is a secret
between me and my bankers. He never had it from me, for I did not know it--I hadn't looked
at my passbook for months. But he drew it all in one cheque, within seventeen and sixpence
of the total. And the total was over five hundred pounds!"

He seemed quite bright again as he culminated.

"Within seventeen and sixpence," he said. "Now how do you account for that, eh? Give me a materialistic
explanation that will explain away all that. You can't. Neither can I."

"I think I can," said Lewisham.

"Well--what is it?"

Lewisham nodded towards a little drawer of the bureau. "Don't you think--perhaps"--a little
ripple of laughter passed across his mind--"he had a skeleton key?"

Lagune's face lingered amusingly in Lewisham's mind as he returned to Clapham. But after a
time that amusement passed away. He declined upon the extraordinary fact that Chaffery was
his father-in-law, Mrs. Chaffery his mother-in-law, that these two and Ethel constituted his
family, his clan, and that grimy graceless house up the Clapham hillside was to be his home.
Home! His connexion with these things as a point of worldly departure was as inexorable now
as though he had been born to it. And a year ago, except for a fading reminiscence of Ethel,
none of these people had existed for him. The ways of Destiny! The happenings of the last few
months, foreshortened in perspective, seemed to have almost a pantomimic rapidity. The thing
took him suddenly as being laughable; and he laughed.

His laugh marked an epoch. Never before had Lewisham laughed at any fix in which he had found
himself! The enormous seriousness of adolescence was coming to an end; the days of his growing
were numbered. It was a laugh of infinite admissions.

CHAPTER XXXI.

IN BATTERSEA PARK.

Now although Lewisham had promised to bring things to a conclusion with Miss Heydinger, he
did nothing in the matter for five weeks, he merely left that crucial letter of hers unanswered.
In that time their removal from Madam Gadow's into the gaunt house at Clapham was accomplished--not
without polyglot controversy--and the young couple settled themselves into the little room
on the second floor even as they had arranged. And there it was that suddenly the world was
changed--was astonishingly transfigured--by a whisper.

 It's a little difficult--The fact
is, my life, you know--She looks at things differently from what we do."

"We?"

"Yes--it's odd, of course. But she has seen your letters--"

"You didn't show her--?"

"No. But, I mean, she knows you write to me, and she knows you write about Socialism and Literature
and--things we have in common--things she hasn't."

"You mean to say she doesn't understand these things?"

"She's not thought about them. I suppose there's a sort of difference in education--"

"And she objects--?"

"No," said Lewisham, lying promptly. "She doesn't object ..."

"Well?" said Miss Heydinger, and her face was white.

"She feels that--She feels--she does not say, of course, but I know she feels that it is something
she ought to share. I know--how she cares for me. And it shames her--it reminds her--Don't
you see how it hurts her?"

"Yes. I see. So that even that little--" Miss Heydinger's breath seemed to catch and she was
abruptly silent.

She spoke at last with an effort. "That it hurts me," she said, and grimaced and stopped again.

"No," said Lewisham, "that is not it." He hesitated.

"I knew this would hurt you."

"You love her. You can sacrifice--"

"No. It is not that. But there is a difference. Hurting her--she would not understand. But
you--somehow it seems a natural thing for me to come to you. I seem to look to you--For her
I am always making allowances--"

"You love her."

"I wonder if it is that makes the difference. Things are so complex. Love means anything--or
nothing. I know you better than I do her, you know me better than she will ever do. I could
tell you things I could not tell her. I could put all myself before you--almost--and know you
would understand--Only--"

"You love her."

"Yes," said Lewisham lamely and pulling at his moustache. "I suppose ... that must be it."

For a space neither spoke. Then Miss Heydinger said "Oh!" with extraordinary emphasis.

"To think of this end to it all! That all your promise ... What is it she gives that I could
not have given?

"Even now! Why should I give up that much of you that is mine? If she could take it--But she
cannot take it. If I let you go--you will do nothing. All this ambition, all these interests
will dwindle and die, and she will not mind. She will not understand. She will think that she
still has you. Why should she covet what she cannot possess? Why should she be given the thing
that is mine--to throw aside?"

She did not look at Lewisham, but before her, her face a white misery.

"In a way--I had come to think of you as something, belonging to me ... I shall--still."

"There is one thing," said Lewisham after a pause, "it is a thing that has come to me once
or twice lately Don't you think that perhaps you over-estimate the things I might have done?
I know we've talked of great things to do. But I've been struggling for half a year and more
to get the sort of living almost anyone seems able to get. It has taken me all my time. One
can't help thinking after that, perhaps the world is a stiffer sort of affair ..."

"No," she said decisively. "You could have done great things.

"Even now," she said, "you may do great things--If only I might see you sometimes, write to
you sometimes--You are so capable and--weak. You must have somebody--That is your weakness.
You fail in your belief. You must have support and belief--unstinted support and belief. Why
could I not be that to you? It is all I want to be. At least--all I want to be now. Why need
she know? It robs her of nothing. I want nothing--she has. But I know of my own strength too
I can do nothing. I know that with you ... It is only knowing hurts her. Why should she know?"

Mr. Lewisham looked at her doubtfully. That phantom greatness of his, it was that lit her eyes.
In that instant, at least he had no doubts of the possibility of his Career. But he knew that
in some way the secret of his greatness and this admiration went together. Conceivably they
were one and indivisible. Why indeed need Ethel know? His imagination ran over the things that
might be done, the things that might happen, and touched swiftly upon complication, confusion,
discovery.

"The thing is, I must simplify my life. I shall do nothing unless I simplify my life. Only
people who are well off can be--complex. It is one thing or the other--"

He hesitated and suddenly had a vision of Ethel weeping as once he had seen her weep with the
light on the tears in her eyes.

"No," he said almost brutally. "No. It's like this--I can't do anything underhand. I mean--I'm
not so amazingly honest--now. But I've not that sort of mind. She would find me out. It would
do no good and she would find me out. My life's too complex. I can't manage it and go straight.
I--you've overrated me. And besides--Things have happened. Something--" He hesitated and then
snatched at his resolve, "I've got to simplify--and that's the plain fact of the case. I'm
sorry, but it is so."

Miss Heydinger made no answer. Her silence astonished him. For nearly twenty seconds perhaps
they sat without speaking. With a quick motion she stood up, and at once he stood up before
her. Her face was flushed, her eyes downcast.

"Good-bye," she said suddenly in a low tone and held out her hand.

"But," said Lewisham and stopped. Miss Heydinger's colour left her.

"Good-bye," she said, looking him suddenly in the eyes and smiling awry. "There is no more
to say, is there? Good-bye."

He took her hand. "I hope I didn't--"

"Good-bye," she said impatiently, and suddenly disengaged her hand and turned away from him.
He made a step after her.

"Miss Heydinger," he said, but she did not stop. "Miss Heydinger." He realised that she did
not want to answer him again....

He remained motionless, watching her retreating figure. An extraordinary sense of loss came
into his mind, a vague impulse to pursue her and pour out vague passionate protestations....

Not once did she look back. She was already remote when he began hurrying after her. Once he
was in motion he quickened his pace and gained upon her. He was within thirty yards of her
as she drew near the gates.

His pace slackened. Suddenly he was afraid she might look back. She passed out of the gates,
out of his sight. He stopped, looking where she had disappeared. Either is none in my copies of engrave,

 The outlook
was, for a London outlook, spacious, down a long slope of roofs towards the Junction, a huge
sky of blue passing upward to the darkling zenith and downward into a hazy bristling mystery
of roofs and chimneys, from which emerged signal lights and steam puffs, gliding chains of
lit window carriages and the vague vistas of streets. She showed him the basket and put it
beside him, and then her eye caught the yellow document in his hand. "What is that you have there?"

He held it out to her. "I found it--lining my yellow box. I had it at Whortley."

She took it and perceived a chronological scheme. It was headed "SCHEMA," there were memoranda
in the margin, and all the dates had been altered by a hasty hand.

"Hasn't it got yellow?" she said.

That seemed to him the wrong thing for her to say. He stared at the document with a sudden
accession of sympathy. There was an interval. He became aware of her hand upon his shoulder,
that she was bending over him. "Dear," she whispered, with a strange change in the quality
of her voice. He knew she was seeking to say something that was difficult to say.

"Yes?" he said presently.

"You are not grieving?"

"What about?"

"This."

"No!"

"You are not--you are not even sorry?" she said.

"No--not even sorry."

"I can't understand that. It's so much--"

"I'm glad," he proclaimed. "Glad."

"But--the trouble--the expense--everything--and your work?"

"Yes," he said, "that's just it."

She looked at him doubtfully. He glanced up at her, and she questioned his eyes. He put his
arm about her, and presently and almost absent-mindedly she obeyed his pressure and bent down
and kissed him.

"It settles things," he said, holding her. "It joins us. Don't you see? Before ... But now
it's different. It's something we have between us. It's something that ... It's the link we
needed. It will hold us together, cement us together. It will be our life. This will be my
work now. The other ..."

He faced a truth. "It was just ... vanity!"

There was still a shade of doubt in her face, a wistfulness.

Presently she spoke.

"Dear," she said.

"Yes?" 

O, him answer the man-child, the awfully indeed led.

And what watch is this? replied the father; regretful scent to watch,
or something worse, if she brought this along hesitating with which
her.

 The pause seemed long and
yet not altogether vacant. She lapsed abruptly into the prosaic. She started from him.

"If I don't go down, Mother will get supper ..."

At the door she stopped and turned a twilight face to him. For a moment they scrutinised one
another. To her he was no more than a dim outline. Impulsively he held out his arms....

Then at the sound of a movement downstairs she freed herself and hurried out. He heard her
call "Mother! You're not to lay supper. You're to rest."

He listened to her footsteps until the kitchen had swallowed them up. Then he turned his eyes
to the Schema again and for a moment it seemed but a little thing.

He picked it up in both hands and looked at it as if it was the writing of another man, and
indeed it was the writing of another man. "Pamphlets in the Liberal Interest," he read, and smiled.

Presently a train of thought carried him off. His attitude relaxed a little, the Schema became
for a time a mere symbol, a point of departure, and he stared out of the window at the darkling
night. For a long time he sat pursuing thoughts that were half emotions, emotions that took
upon themselves the shape and substance of ideas. The deepening current stirred at last among
the roots of speech.

"Yes, it was vanity," he said. "A boy's vanity. For me--anyhow. I'm too two-sided.... Two-sided?...
Commonplace!

"Dreams like mine--abilities like mine. Yes--any man! And yet ...--The things I meant to do!"

His thoughts went to his Socialism, to his red-hot ambition of world mending. He marvelled
at the vistas he had discovered since those days.

"Not for us--Not for us.

"We must perish in the wilderness.--Some day. Somewhen. But not for us....

"Come to think, it is all the Child. The future is the Child. The Future. What are we--any
of us--but servants or traitors to that?...

"Yes. This is life. This alone is life! For this we were made and born. All these other things--all
other things--they are only a sort of play....

"Play!"

His eyes came back to the Schema. His hands shifted to the opposite corner and he hesitated.
The vision of that arranged Career, that ordered sequence of work and successes, distinctions
and yet further distinctions, rose brightly from the symbol. Then he compressed his lips and
tore the yellow sheet in half, tearing very deliberately. He doubled the halves and tore again,
doubled again very carefully and neatly until the Schema was torn into numberless little pieces.
With it he seemed to be tearing his past self.

"Play," he whispered after a long silence.

"It is the end of adolescence," he said; "the end of empty dreams...."

He became very still, his hands resting on the table, his eyes staring out of the blue oblong
of the window. The dwindling light gathered itself together and became a star.

He found he was still holding the torn fragments. He stretched out his hand and dropped them
into that new waste-paper basket Ethel had bought for him.

Two pieces fell outside the basket. He stooped, picked them up, and put them carefully with
their fellows.
