"Proper!  Oh, my dear, I am the most awful person.  I am always getting into trouble.  You
know what Arthur was?  Well, I tell you truly, he is nothing to me.  It's an extraordinary
thing.  I have excellent intentions, but I seem bound to get into scrapes.  There was a teacher
at Brighton, Miss Baker,--a dear old thing.  I called her `Buns.'--She vowed and declared that
I shortened her life by bringing on palpitation of the heart.  I set the dressing-table on
fire by spilling matches and crunching them beneath my heels.  It was not a proper dressing-table,
you know--just a wooden thing frilled round with muslin.  We had two blazes in the last term.
And a dreadful thing occurred!  Would you believe that I was actually careless enough to sit
down on the top of her best Sunday hat, and squash it as flat as a pancake!"

Despite her protestations of remorse, Peggy's voice had an exultant ring as she detailed the
history of her escapades, and Esther shrewdly suspected that she was by no means so penitent
as she declared.  She put on her most severe expression, and said sternly--

"You must be dreadfully careless.  It is to be hoped you will be more careful here, for your
room is far-away from ours, and you might be burned to death before anyone discovered you.
Mother never allows anyone to read in bed in this house, and she is most particular about matches.
You wouldn't like to be burned to a cinder all by yourself some fine night, I should say?"

"No, I shouldn't--or on a wet one either.  It would be so lonely," said Peggy calmly.  "No;
I am a reformed character about matches.  I support home industries, and go in for safeties,
which `strike only on the box.' But the boys would rescue me."  She turned with a smile, and
beamed upon the three tall lads.  "Wouldn't you, boys?  If you hear me squealing any night,
don't stop to think.  Just catch up your ewers of water, and rush to my bedroom.  We might
get up an amateur fire-brigade, to be in readiness.  You three would be the brigade, and I
would be the captain and train you.  It would be capital fun.  At any moment I could give the
signal, and then, whatever you were doing--playing,--working,-- eating,--or on cold frosty
nights, just when you were going to bed, off you would have to rush, and get out your fire-buckets.
Sometimes you might have to break the ice, but there's nothing like being prepared. We might
have the first rehearsal to-night--"

"It's rather funny to hear you talking of being captain over the boys, because the day we heard
that you were coming, they all said that if they were to be bothered with a third girl in the
house, you would have to make yourself useful, and that you should be their fag.  Max said
so, and so did Oswald, and then Robert said they shouldn't have you.  He had lots of little
odd things he wanted done, and he could make you very useful.  He said the other boys shouldn't
have you; you were his property."

"Tut, tut!" said Peggy pleasantly.  She looked at the three scowling, embarrassed faces, and
the mocking light danced back into her eyes.  "So they were all anxious to have me, were they?
How nice!  I'm gratified to hear it.  Is there any little thing I can do for your honourable
self now, Mr Darcy, before I dress for dinner?"

Robert looked across the room at Mellicent with an expression which made that young person
tremble in her shoes.

"All right, young lady, I'll remember you!" he said quietly.  "I've warned you before about
repeating conversations.  Now you'll see what happens.  I'll cure you of that little habit,
my dear, as sure as my name is Robert Darcy--"

"The Honourable Robert Darcy!" murmured a silvery voice from the other side of the fireplace.
Robert turned his head sharply, but Peggy was gazing into the coals with an air of lamb-like
innocence, and he subsided into himself with a grunt of displeasure.

The next day Mrs Saville came to lunch, and spent the afternoon at the vicarage.  As Maxwell
had said, she was a beautiful woman; tall, fair, and elegant, and looking a very fashionable
lady when contrasted with Mrs Asplin in her well-worn serge, but her face was sad and anxious
in expression.  Esther noticed that her eyes filled with tears more than once as she looked
round the table at the husband and wife and the three tall, well-grown children; and when the
two ladies were alone in the drawing-room she broke into helpless sobbings.

"Oh, how happy you are!  How I envy you!  Husband, children,--all beside you.  Oh, never, never
let one of your girls marry a man who lives abroad.  My heart is torn in two; I have no rest.
I am always longing for the one who is not there.  I must go back,--the major needs me; but
my Peggy,--my own little girl!  It is like death to leave her behind!"

Mrs Asplin put her arms round the tall figure, and rocked her gently to and fro.

"I know!  I know!" she said brokenly.  "I ache for you, dear; but I understand!  I have parted
with a child of my own--not for a few years, but for ever, till we meet again in God's heaven.
I'll help you every way I can.  I'll watch her night and day; I'll coddle her when she's ill;
I'll try to make her a good woman.  I'll love her, dear, and she shall be my own special charge.
I'll be a second mother to her."

"You dear, good woman!  God bless your kind heart!" said Mrs Saville brokenly.  "I can't help
breaking down, but indeed I have much to be thankful for.  I can't tell you what a relief it
is to feel that she is in this house.  The principals of that school at Brighton were all that
is good and excellent, but they did not understand my Peggy."  The tears were still in her
eyes, but she broke into a flickering smile at the last word.  "My children have such spirits!
I am afraid they really do give more trouble than other boys and girls, but they are not really
naughty.  They are truthful and generous, and wonderfully warm-hearted. I never needed to punish
Peg when she was a little girl; it was enough to show that she had grieved me.  She never did
the same thing again after that; but--oh, dear me!--the ingenuity of that child in finding
fresh fields for mischief!  Dear Mrs Asplin, I am afraid she will try your patience.  You must
be sure to keep a list of all the breakages and accidents, and charge them to our account.
Peggy is an expensive little person.  You know what Arthur was."

"Bless him--yes!  I had hardly a tumbler left in the house," said Mrs Asplin, with gusto. 
"But I don't grieve myself about a few breakages. I have had too much to do with schoolboys
for that!--And now give me all the directions you can about this precious little maid, while
we have the room to ourselves."

For the next hour there the two ladies sat in conclave about Miss Peggy's mental, moral, and
physical welfare.  Mrs Asplin had a book in her hand, in which from time to time she jotted
down notes of a curious and inconsequent character.  "Pay attention to private reading. Gas-fire
in her bedroom for chilly weather.  See dentist in Christmas holidays.  Query: gold plate over
eye-tooth?  Boots to order, Beavan and Company, Oxford Street.  Cod-liver oil in winter.  Careless
about changing shoes.  Damp brings on throat.  Aconite and belladonna."  So on, and so on.
There seemed no end to the warnings and instructions of this anxious mother; but when all was
settled as far as possible, the ladies adjourned into the schoolroom to join the young people
at their tea, so that Mrs Saville might be able to picture her daughter's surroundings when
separated from her by those weary thousands of miles.

"What a bright, cheery room!" she said smilingly, as she took her seat at the table, and her
eyes wandered round as if striving to print the scene in her memory.  How many times, as she
lay panting beneath the swing of the punkah, she would recall that cool English room, with
its vista of garden through the windows, the long table in the centre, the little figure with
the pale face and plaited hair, seated midway between the top and bottom!  Oh! the moments
of longing--of wild, unbearable longing--when she would feel that she must break loose from
her prison-house and fly away,--that not the length of the earth itself could keep her back,
that she would be willing to give up life itself just to hold Peggy in her arms for five minutes,
to kiss the sweet lips, to meet the glance of the loving eyes--

But this would never do!  Had she not vowed to be cheerful?  The young folks were looking at
her with troubled glances.  She roused herself, and said briskly--

"I see you make this a playroom as well as a study.  Somebody has been wood-carving over there,
and you have one of those dwarf billiard-tables.  I want to give a present to this room--something
that will be a pleasure and occupation to you all; but I can't make up my mind what would be
best.  Can you give me a few suggestions?  Is there anything that you need, or that you have
fancied you might like?"

"It's very kind of you," said Esther warmly; and echoes of "Very kind!" came from every side
of the table, while boys and girls stared at each other in puzzled consideration.  Maxwell
longed to suggest a joiner's bench, but refrained out of consideration for the girls' feelings.
Mellicent's eager face, however, was too eloquent to escape attention, and Mrs Saville smiled
at her in an encouraging manner.

"Well, dear, what is it?  Don't be afraid.  I mean something really nice and handsome; not
just a little thing.  Tell me what you thought?"

"A--a new violin!" cried Mellicent eagerly.  "Mine is so old and squeaky, and my teacher said
I needed a new one badly.  A new violin would be nicest of all."

Mrs Saville looked round the table, caught an expressive grimace going the round of three boyish
faces, and raised her eyebrows inquiringly.

"Yes?  Whatever you like best, of course.  It is all the same to me. But would the violin be
a pleasure to all?  What about the boys?"

"They would hear me play!  The pieces would sound nicer.  They would like to hear them."

"Ahem!" coughed Maxwell loudly; and at that there was a universal shriek of merriment.  Peggy's
clear "Ho! ho!" rang out above the rest, and her mother looked at her with sparkling eyes.
Yes, yes, yes; the child was happy!  She had settled down already into the cheery, wholesome
life of the vicarage, and was in her element among these merry boys and girls! She hugged the
thought to her heart, finding in it her truest comfort. The laughter lasted several minutes,
and broke out intermittently from time to time as that eloquent cough recurred to memory, but
after all it was Mellicent who was the one to give the best suggestion.

"Well then, a--a what-do-you-call-it!" she cried.  "A thing-um-me-bob! One of those three-legged
things for taking photographs!  The boys look so silly sometimes, rolling about together in
the garden, and we have often and often said, `Don't you wish we could take their photographs?
They would look such frights!'  We could have ever so much fun with a what-do-you-call-it?"

"Ah, that's something like!"  "Good business."  "Oh, wouldn't it be sweet!" came the quick
exclamations; and Mrs Saville looked most pleased and excited of all.

"A camera!" she cried.  "What a charming idea!  Then you would be able to take photographs
of Peggy and the whole household, and send them out for me to see.  How delightful!  That is
a happy thought, Mellicent.  I am so grateful to you for thinking of it, dear.  I'll buy a
really good large one, and all the necessary materials, and send them down at once. Do any
of you know how to set to work?"

"I do, Mrs Saville," Oswald said.  "I had a small camera of my own, but it got smashed some
years ago.  I can show them how to begin, and we will take lots of photographs of Peggy for
you, in groups and by herself.  They mayn't be very good at first, but you will be interested
to see her in different positions.  We will take her walking, and bicycling, and sitting in
the garden, and every way we can think of--"

"And whenever she has a new dress or hat, so that you may know what they are like," added Mellicent
anxiously.  "Are her hats going to be the same as ours, or is she to choose them for herself?"

"She may choose them for herself, subject, of course, to your mother's refraining influence.
If she were to develop a fondness for scarlet feathers, for instance, I think Mrs Asplin should
interfere; but Peggy has good taste.  I don't think she will go far wrong," said the girl's
mother, looking at her fondly; and the little white face quivered before it broke into its
sunny, answering smile.

Three times that evening, after Mrs Saville had left, did her companions surprise the glitter
of tears in Peggy's eyes; but there was a dignified reserve about her manner which forbade
outspoken sympathy. Even when she was discovered to be quietly crying behind her book, when
Maxwell flipped it mischievously out of her hands,--even then did Peggy preserve her wonderful
self-possession.  The tears were trickling down her cheeks, and her poor little nose was red
and swollen, but she looked up at Maxwell without a quiver, and it was he who stood gaping
before her, aghast and miserable.

"Oh, I say!  I'm fearfully sorry!"

"So am I," said Peggy severely.  "It was rude, and not at all funny. And it injures the book.
I have always been taught to reverence books, and treat them as dear and valued companions.
Pick it up, please. Thank you.  Don't do it again."  She hitched herself round in her chair,
and settled down once more to her reading, while Maxwell slunk back to his seat.  When Peggy
was offended she invariably fell back upon Mariquita's grandiose manner, and the sting of her
sharp little tongue left her victims dumb and smarting.

CHAPTER SIX.

A NEW FRIENDSHIP.

A week after this, Mrs Saville came to pay her farewell visit before sailing for India.  Mother
and daughter went out for a walk in the morning, and retired to the drawing-room together for
the afternoon. There was much that they wanted to say to each other, yet for the most part
they were silent, Peggy sitting with her head on her mother's shoulder, and Mrs Saville's arms
clasped tightly round her.  Every now and then she stroked the smooth brown head, and sometimes
Peggy raised her lips and kissed the cheek which leant against her own, but the sentences came
at long intervals.

"If I were ill, mother--a long illness--would you come?"

"On wings, darling!  As fast as boat and train could bring me."

"And if you were ill?"

"I should send for you, if it were within the bounds of possibility--I promise that!  You must
write often, Peggy--long, long letters.  Tell me all you do, and feel, and think.  You will
be almost a woman when we meet again.  Don't grow up a stranger to me, darling."

"Every week, mother!  I'll write something each day, and then it will be like a diary.  I'll
tell you every bit of my life..."

"Be a good girl, Peggy.  Do all you can for Mrs Asplin, who is so kind to you.  She will give
you what money you need, and if at any time you should want more than your ordinary allowance,
for presents or any special purpose, just tell her about it, and she will understand.  You
can have anything in reason; I want you to be happy.  Don't fret, dearie.  I shall be with
father, and the time will pass.  In three years I shall be back again, and then, Peg, then,
how happy we shall be!  Only three years."

Peggy shivered, and was silent.  Three years seem an endless space when one is young.  She
shut her eyes, and pondered drearily upon all that would happen before the time of separation
was passed.  She would be seventeen, nearly eighteen--a young lady who wore dresses down at
her ankles, and did up her hair.  This was the last time, the very, very last time when she
would be a child in her mother's arms.  The new relationship might be nearer, sweeter, but
it could never be the same, and the very sound of the words "the last time" sends a pang to
the heart.

Half an hour later the carriage drove up to the door.  Mr and Mrs Asplin came into the room
to say a few words of farewell, and then left Peggy to see her mother off.  There were no words
spoken on the way, and so quietly did they move that Robert had no suspicion that anyone was
near, as he took off his shoes in the cloak-room opening off the hall. He tossed his cap on
to a nail, picked up his book, and was just about to sally forth, when the sound of a woman's
voice sent a chill through his veins.  The tone of the voice was low, almost a whisper, yet
he had never in his life heard anything so thrilling as its intense and yearning tenderness.
"Oh, my Peggy!" it said.  "My little Peggy!"  And then, as in reply, came a low moaning sound,
a feeble bleat like that of a little lamb torn from its mother's side.  Robert charged back
into the cloak-room, and kicked savagely at the boots and shoes which were scattered about
the floor, his lips pressed together, and his brows meeting in a straight black line across
his forehead.  Another minute, and the carriage rolled away.  He peeped out of the door in
time to see a little figure fly out into the rain, and walking slowly towards the schoolroom
came face to face with Mrs Asplin.

"Gone?" she inquired sadly.  "Well, I'm thankful it is over.  Poor little dear, where is she?
Flown up to her room, I suppose.  We'll leave her alone until tea-time.  It will be the truest
kindness."

"Yes," said Robert vaguely.  He was afraid that the good lady would not be so willing to leave
Peggy undisturbed if she knew her real whereabouts, and was determined to say nothing to undeceive
her.  He felt sure that the girl had hidden herself in the summer-house at the bottom of the
garden, and a nice, damp, mouldy retreat it would be this afternoon, with the rain driving
in through the open window, and the creepers dripping on the walls.  Just the place in which
to sit and break your heart, and catch rheumatic fever with the greatest possible ease.  And
yet Robert said no word of warning to Mrs Asplin.  He had an inward conviction that if anyone
were to go to the rescue, that person should be himself, and that he, more than anyone else,
would be able to comfort Peggy in her affliction.  He sauntered up and down the hall until
the coast was clear, then dashed once more into the cloak-room, took an Inverness coat from
a nail, a pair of goloshes from the floor, and sped rapidly down the garden-path.  In less
than two minutes he had reached the summer-house, and was peeping cautiously in at the door.
Yes; he was right.  There sat Peggy, with her arms stretched out before her on the rickety
table, her shoulders heaving with long, gasping sobs. Her fingers clenched and unclenched themselves
spasmodically, and the smooth little head rolled to and fro in an abandonment of grief.  Robert
stood looking on in silent misery.  He had a boy's natural hatred of tears, and his first impulse
was to turn tail, go back to the house, and send someone to take his place; but even as he
hesitated he shivered in the chilly damp, and remembered the principal reason of his coming.
He stepped forward and dropped the cloak over the bent shoulders, whereupon Peggy started up
and turned a scared white face upon him.

"Who, who--Oh! it is you!  What do you want?"

"Nothing.  I saw you come out, and thought you would be cold.  I brought you out my coat."

"I don't want it; I am quite warm.  I came here to be alone."

"I know; I'm not going to bother.  Mrs Asplin thinks you are in your room, and I didn't tell
her that I'd seen you go out.  But it's damp. If you catch cold, your mother will be sorry."

Peggy looked at him thoughtfully, and there was a glimmer of gratitude in her poor tear-stained
eyes.

"Yes; I p-p-romised to be careful.  You are very kind, but I can't think of anything to-night.
I am too miserably wretched."

"I know; I've been through it.  I was sent away to a boarding-school when I was a little kid
of eight, and I howled myself to sleep every night for weeks.  It is worse for you, because
you are older, but you will be happy enough in this place when you get settled.  Mrs Asplin
is a brick, and we have no end of fun.  It is ever so much better than being at school; and,
I say, you mustn't mind what Mellicent said the other night.  She's a little muff, always saying
the wrong thing.  We were only chaffing when we said you were to be our fag.  We never really
meant to bully you."

"You c-couldn't if you t-tried," stammered Peggy brokenly, but with a flash of her old spirit
which delighted her hearer.

"No; of course not.  You can stand up for yourself; I know that very well.  But look here:
I'll make a compact, if you will.  Let us be friends.  I'll stick to you and help you when
you need it, and you stick to me.  The other girls have their brother to look after them, but
if you want anything done, if anyone is cheeky to you, and you want him kicked, for instance,
just come to me, and I'll do it for you.  It's all nonsense about being a fag, but there are
lots of things you could do for me if you would, and I'd be awfully grateful.  We might be
partners, and help one another--"

Robert stopped in some embarrassment, and Peggy stared fixedly at him, her pale face peeping
out from the folds of the Inverness coat.  She had stopped crying, though the tears still trembled
on her eyelashes, and her chin quivered in uncertain fashion.  Her eyes dwelt on the broad
forehead, the overhanging brows, the square, massive chin, and brightened with a flash of approval.

"You are a nice boy," she said slowly.  "I like you!  You don't really need my help, but you
thought it would cheer me to feel that I was wanted.  Yes; I'll be your partner, and I'll be
of real use to you yet. You'll find that out, Robert Darcy, before you have done with me."

"All right, so much the better.  I hope you will; but you know you can't expect to have your
own way all the time.  I'm the senior partner, and you will have to do what I tell you.  Now
I say it's damp in this hole, and you ought to come back to the house at once.  It's enough
to kill you to sit in this draught."

"I'd rather like to be killed.  I'm tired of life.  I shouldn't mind dying a bit."

"Humph!" said Robert shortly.  "Jolly cheerful news that would be for your poor mother when
she arrived at the end of her journey!  Don't be so selfish.  Now then, up you get!  Come along
to the house."

"I wo--" Peggy began, then suddenly softened, and glanced apologetically into his face.  "Yes,
I will, because you ask me.  Smuggle me up to my room, Robert, and don't, don't, if you love
me, let Mellicent come near me!  I couldn't stand her chatter to-night!"

"She will have to fight her way over my dead body," said Robert firmly; and Peggy's sweet little
laugh quavered out on the air.

"Nice boy!" she repeated heartily.  "Nice boy; I do like you!"

CHAPTER SEVEN.

AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS.

Peggy looked very sad and wan after her mother's departure, but her companions soon discovered
that anything like outspoken sympathy was unwelcome.  The redder her eyes, the more erect and
dignified was her demeanour; if her lips trembled when she spoke, the more grandiose and formidable
became her conversation, for Peggy's love of long words and high-sounding expressions was fully
recognised by this time, and caused much amusement in the family.

A few days after Mrs Saville sailed, a welcome diversion arrived in the shape of the promised
camera.  The Parcels Delivery van drove up to the door, and two large cases were delivered,
one of which was found to contain the camera itself, the tripod and a portable dark room, while
the other held such a collection of plates, printing-frames, and chemicals as delighted the
eyes of the beholders.  It was the gift of one who possessed not only a deep purse, but a most
true and thoughtful kindness, for, when young people are concerned, two-thirds of the enjoyment
of any present is derived from the possibility of being able to put it to immediate use.  As
it was a holiday afternoon, it was unanimously agreed to take two groups and develop them straightway.

"Professional photographers are so dilatory," said Peggy severely; "and indeed I have noticed
that amateurs are even worse.  I have twice been photographed by friends, and they have solemnly
promised to send me a copy within a few days.  I have waited, consumed by curiosity, and, my
dears, it has been months before it has arrived!  Now we will make a rule to finish off our
groups at once, and not keep people waiting until all the interest has died away.  There's
no excuse for such dilatory behaviour!"

"There is some work to do, remember, Peggy.  You can't get a photograph by simply taking off
and putting on the cap; you must have a certain amount of time and fine weather.  I haven't
had much experience, but I remember thinking that photographs were jolly cheap, considering
all the trouble they cost, and wondering how the fellows could do them at the price.  There's
the developing, and washing, and printing, and toning,-- half a dozen processes before you
are finished."

Peggy smiled in a patient, forbearing manner.

"They don't get any less, do they, by putting them off?  Procrastination will never lighten
labour.  Come, put the camera up for us, like a good boy, and we'll show you how to do it."
She waved her hand towards the brown canvas bag, and the six young people immediately seized
different portions of the tripod and camera, and set to work to put them together. The girls
tugged and pulled at the sliding legs, which were too new and stiff to work with ease; Maxwell
turned the screws which moved the bellows, and tried in vain to understand their working; Robert
peered through the lenses, and Oswald alternately raved, chided, and jeered at their efforts.
With so many cooks at work, it took an unconscionable time to get ready, and even when the
camera was perched securely on its spidery legs, it still remained to choose the site of the
picture, and to pose the victims.  After much wandering about the garden, it was finally decided
that the schoolroom window would be an appropriate background for a first effort; but a heated
argument followed before the second question could be decided.

"I vote that we stand in couples, arm-on-arm,--like this!" said Mellicent, sidling up to her
beloved brother, and gazing into his face in a sentimental manner, which had the effect of
making him stride away as fast as he could walk, muttering indignant protests beneath his breath.

Then Esther came forward with her suggestion.

"I'll hold a book as if I were reading aloud, and you can all sit round in easy, natural positions,
and look as if you were listening.  I think that would make a charming picture."

"Idiotic, I call it!  `Scene from the Goodchild family; mamma reading aloud to the little ones.'
Couldn't possibly look easy and natural under the circumstances; should feel too miserable.
Try again, my dear. You must think of something better than that."

It was impossible to please those three fastidious boys.  One suggestion after another was
made, only to be waved aside with lordly contempt, until at last the girls gave up any say
in the matter, and left Oswald to arrange the group in a manner highly satisfactory to himself
and his two friends, however displeasing to the more artistic members of the party.  Three
girls in front, two boys behind, all standing stiff as pokers; with solemn faces, and hair
ruffled by constant peepings beneath the black cloth.  Peggy in the middle, with her eyebrows
more peaked than ever, and an expression of resigned martyrdom on her small, pale face; Mellicent,
large and placid, on the left; Esther on the right, scowling at nothing, and, over their shoulders,
the two boys' heads, handsome Max and frowning Robert.

"There," cried Oswald, "that's what I call a sensible arrangement!  If you take a photograph,
take a photograph, and don't try to do a pastoral play at the same time.  Keep still a moment,
and I will see if it is focused all right.  I can see you pulling faces, Peggy!  It's not at
all becoming.  Now then, I'll put in the plate--that's the way!-- one--two--three--and I shall
take you.  Stea-dy?"

Instantly Mellicent burst into giggles of laughter, and threw up her hands to her face, to
be roughly seized from behind and shaken into order.

"Be quiet, you silly thing!  Didn't you hear him say steady?  What are you trying to do?"

"She has spoiled this plate, anyhow," said Oswald icily.  "I'll try the other, and if she can't
keep still this time she had better run away and laugh by herself at the other end of the garden.
Baby!"

"Not a ba--" began Mellicent indignantly; but she was immediately punched into order, and stood
with her mouth wide open, waiting to finish her protest so soon as the ordeal was over.

Peggy forestalled her, however, with an eager plea to be allowed to take the third picture herself.

"I want to have one of Oswald to send to mother, for we are not complete without him, and I
know it would please her to think I had taken it myself," she urged; and permission was readily
granted, as everyone felt that she had a special claim in the matter.  Oswald therefore put
in new plates, gave instructions as to how the shutters were to be worked, and retired to take
up an elegant position in the centre of the group.

"Are you read-ee?" cried Peggy, in professional sing-song; then she put her head on one side
and stared at the group with twinkling eyes.  "Hee, hee!  How silly you look!  Everyone has
a new expression for the occasion!  Your own mothers would not recognise you!  That's better.
Keep that smile going for another moment, and--how long must I keep off the cap, did you say?"

Oswald hesitated.

"Well, it varies.  You have to use your own judgment.  It depends upon-- lots of things!  You
might try one second for the first, and two for the next, then one of them is bound to be right."

"And one a failure!  If I were going to depend on my judgment, I'd have a better one than that!"
cried Peggy scornfully.  "Ready!  A little more cheerful, if you please--Christmas is coming!
That's one.  Be so good as to remain in your positions, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll try
another."  The second shutter was pulled out, the cap removed, and the group broke up with
sighs of relief, exhausted with the strain of cultivating company smiles for a whole two minutes
on end.  Max stayed to help the girls to fold up the camera, while Oswald darted into the house
to prepare the dark room for the development of the plates.

When he came out, ten minutes later on, it was a pleasant surprise to discover Miss Mellicent
holding a plate in her hand and taking sly peeps inside the shutter, just "to see how it looked."
He stormed and raved, while Mellicent looked like a martyr, wished to know how a teeny little
light like that could possibly hurt anything, and seemed incapable of understanding that if
one flash of sunlight could make a picture, it could also destroy it with equal swiftness.
Oswald was forced to comfort himself with the reflection that there were still three plates
uninjured; and, when all was ready, the six operators squeezed themselves in the dark room,
to watch the process of development, indulging the while in the most flowery expectations.

"If it is very good, let me send it to an illustrated paper.  Oh, do!" said Mellicent, with
a gush.  "I have often seen groups of people in them.  `The thing-a-me-bob touring company,'
and stupid old cricketers, and things like that.  We should be far more interesting."

"It will make a nice present for mother, enlarged and mounted," said Peggy thoughtfully.  "I
shall keep an album of my own, and mount every single picture we take.  If there are any failures,
I shall put them in too, for they will make it all the more amusing.  Photograph albums are
horribly uninteresting as a rule, but mine shall be quite different. There shall be nothing
stiff and prim about it; the photographs shall be dotted about in all sorts of positions, and
underneath each I shall put in--ah--conversational annotations."  Her tongue lingered over
the words with triumphant enjoyment.  "Conversational annotations, describing the circumstances
under which it was taken, and anything about it which is worth remembering...  What are you
going to do with those bottles?"

Oswald ruffled his hair in embarrassment.  To pose as an instructor in an art, when one is
in doubt about its very rudiments, is a position which has its drawbacks.

"I don't--quite--know.  The stupid fellow has written instructions on all the other labels,
and none on these except simply `Developer Number 1' and `Developer Number 2'; I think the
only difference is that one is rather stronger than the other.  I'll put some of the Number
2 in a dish, and see what happens; I believe that's the right way--in fact, I'm sure it is.
You pour it over the plate and jog it about, and in two or three minutes the picture ought
to begin to appear.  Like this!"

Five eager faces peered over his shoulders, rosy red in the light of the lamp; five pairs of
lips uttered a simultaneous "Oh!" of surprise; five cries of dismay followed in instant echo.
It was the tragedy of a second.  Even as Oswald poured the fluid over the plate, a picture
flashed before their eyes, each one saw and recognised some fleeting feature; and, in the very
moment of triumph, lo, darkness, as of night, a sheet of useless, blackened glass!

"What about the conversational annotations?" asked Robert slily; but he was interrupted by
a storm of indignant queries, levied at the head of the poor operator, who tried in vain to
carry off his mistake with a jaunty air.  Now that he came to think of it, he believed you
did mix the two developers together!  Just at the moment he had forgotten the proportions,
but he would go outside and look it up in the book; and he beat a hasty retreat, glad to escape
from the scene of his failure.  It was rather a disconcerting beginning; but hope revived once
more when Oswald returned, primed with information from the Photographic Manual, and Peggy's
plates were taken from their case and put into the bath. This time the result was slow in coming.
Five minutes went by, and no signs of a picture--ten minutes, a quarter of an hour.

"It's a good thing to develop slowly; you get the details better," said Oswald, in so professional
a manner that he was instantly reinstated in public confidence; but when twenty minutes had
passed, he looked perturbed, and thought he would use a little more of the hastener.  The bath
was strengthened and strengthened, but still no signs of a picture. The plate was put away
in disgust, and the second one tried with a like result.  So far as it was possible to judge,
there was nothing to be developed on the plate.

"A nice photographer you are, I must say!  What are you playing at now?" asked Max, in scornful
impatience; and Oswald turned severely to Peggy--

"Which shutter did you draw out?  The one nearest to yourself?"

"Yes, I did--of course I did!"

"You drew out the nearest to you, and the farthest away from the lens?"

"Precisely--I told you so!" and Peggy bridled with an air of virtue.

"Then no wonder nothing has come out!  You have drawn out the wrong shutter each time, and
the plates have never been exposed.  They are wasted!  That's fivepence simply thrown away,
to say nothing of the chemicals!"

His air of aggrieved virtue; Peggy's little face staring at him, aghast with horror; the thought
of four plates being used and leaving not a vestige of a result, were all too funny to be resisted.
Mellicent went off into irrepressible giggles; Max gave a loud "Ha, ha!" and once again a mischievous
whisper sounded in Peggy's ear--

"Good for you, Mariquita!  What about the `conversational annotations'?"

CHAPTER EIGHT.

PEGGY SHOWS HERSELF IN HER TRUE COLOURS.

The photographic fever burnt fiercely for the next few weeks.  Every spare hour was devoted
to the camera, and there was not a person in the house, from the vicar himself to the boy who
came in to clean boots and knives, who had not been pressed to repeated sittings.  There were
no more blank plates, but there were some double ones which had been twice exposed, and showed
such a kaleidoscopic jumble of heads and legs as was as good as any professional puzzle; but,
besides these, there were a number of groups where the likenesses were quite recognisable,
though scarcely flattering enough to be pleasant to the originals. Least funeral what i saw shylock

  If you weren't so fat, you would do splendiforously for Ophelia.
I might manage it, perhaps, if I took you from the back, with your head turned over your shoulder,
so as to show only the profile.  Like that!  Don't move now, but let me see how you look."
She took Mellicent's head between her hands as she spoke, wagged it to and fro, as if it belonged
to a marionette, and then gave a frog-like leap to a farther corner of the bed to study the
effect.  "A little more to the right.  Chin higher!  Look at the ceiling.  Yes-es--I can do
it.  I see how it can be done."

It turned out, indeed, that Peggy had a genius for designing and posing pretty, graceful pictures.
With a few yards of muslin and a basket, or such odds and ends of rubbish as horrified Esther's
tidy soul to behold, she achieved marvels in the way of fancy costumes, and transformed the
placid Mellicent into a dozen different characters: Ophelia, crowned with flowers; Marguerite,
pulling the petals of a daisy; Hebe, bearing a basket of fruit on her head, and many other
fanciful impersonations, were improvised and taken before the week was over.  She went about
the work in her usual eager, engrossed, happy-go-lucky fashion, sticking pins by the dozen
into Mellicent's flesh in the ardour of arrangement, and often making a really charming picture,
only to spoil it at the last moment by a careless movement, which altered the position of the
camera, and so omitted such important details as the head of the sitter, or left her squeezed
into one corner of the picture, like a sparrow on the house-top.

Out of a dozen photographs, three, however, were really remarkable successes; as pretty pictures
as one could wish to see, and, moreover, exceedingly good likenesses of the bonnie little subject.
Esther's part of the work was performed with her usual conscientious care; and when the last
prints were mounted, the partners gazed at them with rapture and pride.  They were exhibited
at the dinner-table the same evening amid a scene of riotous excitement.  The vicar glowed
with pleasure; Mrs Asplin called out, "Oh, my baby!  Bless her heart!" and whisked away two
tears of motherly pride.  Oswald was silent and subdued; and even Robert said, "Humph--it's
not so bad," a concession which turned the girls' heads by its wonderful magnanimity.

Their triumph was almost sweeter than they had expected; but, truth to tell, they had had too
much of photography during the last week, and Mrs Asplin's prophecy came true, inasmuch as
it now ceased to become an occupation of absorbing interest, and assumed its rightful place
as an amusement to be enjoyed now and then, as opportunity afforded.

CHAPTER NINE.

THE HONOURABLE ROSALIND.

By the beginning of October Peggy had quite settled down in her new home, and had established
her right to be Arthur Saville's sister by convulsing the quiet household with her tricks and
capers.  She was affectionate, obedient, and strictly truthful; her prim little face, grandiose
expressions, and merry ways, made her a favourite with everyone in the house, from the vicar,
who loved to converse with her in language even more high-flown than her own, to the old North-country
cook, who confided in the housemaid that she "fair-ly did love that little thing," and manoeuvred
to have apple charlotte for dinner as often as possible, because the "little thing" had praised
her prowess in that direction, and commended the charlotte as a "delicious confection." Mrs
Asplin was specially tender over the girl who had been left in her charge, and, in return,
Peggy was all that was sweet and affectionate, vowed that she could never do enough to repay
such kindness, and immediately fell into a fresh pickle, and half frightened the life out of
her companions by her hairbreadth escapes.  Her careless, happy-go-lucky ways seemed all the
more curious because of the almost Quaker-like neatness of her appearance.  Mellicent was often
untidy, and even Esther had moments of dishevelment, but Peggy was a dainty little person,
whose hair was always smooth, whose dress well brushed and natty.  Her artistic sense was too
keen to allow of any shortcoming in this respect; but she seemed blessed with a capacity of
acting before she thought, which had many disastrous consequences.  She was by no means a robust
girl, and Mrs Asplin fussed over her little ailments like an old mother-hen with a delicate
nursling.  One prescription after another was unearthed for her benefit, until the washstand
in her room looked like a small chemist's shop.  An array of doctor's tinctures, gargles, and
tonics, stood on one side, while on the other were a number of home-made concoctions in disused
wine-bottles, such as a paregoric cough-mixture, and a cooling draught to be taken the first
thing in the morning, which last pretended to be lemonade, but in reality contained a number
of medicinal powders.  "Take it up tenderly, treat it with care!" was Peggy's motto with respect
to this last-named medicine, for she had discovered that by judicious handling it was possible
to enjoy a really tasty beverage, and to leave the sediment untouched at the bottom of the bottle!

Esther and Mellicent were almost equally well supplied by their anxious mother, but their bottles
behaved in a well-regulated fashion, and never took upon themselves to play tricks, while those
in Peggy's room seemed infected by the spirit of the owner, and amused themselves with seeing
how much mischief they could accomplish.  A bottle of ammonia had been provided as a cure for
bites of gnats and flies; Peggy flicked a towel more hastily than usual, and down it fell,
the contents streaming over the wood, and splashing on to the wardrobe near at hand, with the
consequence that every sign of polish was removed, and replaced by white unsightly stains.
The glass stopper of a smelling-salts bottle became fixed in its socket, and, being anointed
with oil and placed before the fire to melt, popped out suddenly with a noise as of a cannon
shot, aimed accurately for the centre of the mirror, and smashed it into a dozen pieces.  The
"safety ink-pot," out of which she indited her letters to her mother, came unfastened of its
own accord and rolled up and down the clean white toilet cover.  This, at least, was the impression
left by Peggy's innocent protestations, while the gas and soap seemed equally obstinate--the
one refusing to be lowered when she left the room, and the other insisting upon melting itself
to pieces in her morning bath!

"Mrs Saville was right--Peggy is a most expensive person!" cried Mrs Asplin in dismay, when
the bills for repairs came in; but when the vicar suggested the advisability of a reproof,
she said, "Oh, poor child; she is so lonely--I haven't the heart to scold her;" and Peggy continued
to detail accounts of her latest misfortune with an air of exaggerated melancholy, which barely
concealed the underlying satisfaction.  It required a philosophic mind to be able to take damages
to personal property in so amiable a fashion; but occasionally Peggy's pickles took an irresistibly
comical character.  The story was preserved in the archives of the family of one evening when
the three girls had been sent upstairs to wash their abundant locks and dry them thoroughly
before retiring to bed.  A fire was kindled in the old nursery, which was now used as a sewing-room,
and Mrs Asplin, who understood nothing if it was not the art of making young folks happy, had
promised a supper of roast apples and cream when the drying process was finished.

Esther and Mellicent were squatted on the hearth, in their blue dressing-gowns, when in tripped
Peggy, fresh as a rose, in a long robe of furry white, tied round the waist with a pink cord.
One bath-towel was round her shoulders, and a smaller one extended in her hands, with the aid
of which she proceeded to perform a fancy dance, calling out instructions to herself the while,
in imitation of the dancing-school mistress.  "To the right--two--three!  To the left--two--three!
Spring! Pirouette!  Atti-tude!"  She stood poised on one foot, towel waving above her head,
damp hair dripping down her back, while Esther and Mellicent shrieked with laughter, and drummed
applause with heel and toe.  Then she flopped down on the centre of the hearth, and there was
an instantaneous exclamation of dismay.

"Phew!  What a funny smell!  Phew!  Phew!  Whatever can it be?"

"I smelt it too.  Peggy, what have you been doing?  It's simply awful!"

"Hair-wash, I suppose, or the soap--I noticed it myself.  It will pass off," said Peggy easily;
but at that moment Mrs Asplin entered the room, sniffed the air, and cried loudly--

"Bless me, what's this?  A regular Apothecaries' Hall!  Paregoric!  It smells as if someone
had been drinking quarts of paregoric!  Peggy, child, your throat is not sore again?"

"Not at all, thank you.  Quite well.  I have taken no medicine to-day."

"But it is you, Peggy--it really is!"  Mellicent declared.  "There was no smell at all before
you came into the room.  I noticed it as soon as the door was opened, and when you came and
sat down beside us--whew! simply fearful!"

"I have taken no medicine to-day," repeated Peggy firmly.  Then she started, as if with a sudden
thought, lifted a lock of hair, sniffed at it daintily, and dropped it again with an air of
conviction.  "Ah, I comprehend!  There seems to have been a slight misunderstanding.  I have
mistaken the bottles.  I imagined that I was using the mixture you gave me, but--"

"She has washed her hair in cough-mixture!  Oh, oh, oh!  She has mixed paregoric and treacle
with the water!  Oh, what will I do! what will I do!  This child will be the death of me!"
Mrs Asplin put her hand to her side, and laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks, while
Mellicent rolled about on the floor, and Esther's quiet "He, he, he!" filled up the intervals
between the bursts of merriment.

Peggy was marched off to have her hair re-washed and rinsed, and came back ten minutes later,
proudly complacent, to seat herself in the most comfortable stool and eat roast apple with
elegant enjoyment.  She was evidently quite ready to enlarge upon her latest feat, but the
sisters had exhausted the subject during her absence, and had, moreover, a piece of news to
communicate which was of even greater interest.

"Oh, Peggy, what y'think?" cried Mellicent, running her words into each other in breathless
fashion, as her habit was when excited; "I've got something beautiful to tell you.  S'afternoon
Bob got a letter from his mother to say that they were all coming down next week to stay at
the Larches for the winter.  They come almost every year, and have shooting-parties, and come
to church and sit in the big square pew, where you can just see their heads over the side.
They look so funny, sitting in a row without their bodies.  Last year there was a young lady
with them who wore a big grey hat--the loveliest hat you ever saw--with roses under the brim,
and stick-up things all glittering with jewels, and she got married at Christmas.  I saw her
photograph in a magazine, and knew her again in a moment.  I used to stare at her, and once
she smiled back at me.  She looked sweet when she smiled.  Lady Darcy always comes to call
on mother, and she and father go there to dinner ever so many times, and we are asked to play
with Rosalind--the Honourable Rosalind.  I expect they will ask you to go too.  Isn't it exciting?"

"I can bear it," said Peggy coldly.  "If I try very hard, I think I can support the strain."

The Larches, the country house of Lord Darcy, had already been pointed out to her notice; but
the information that the family was coming down for the yearly visit was unwelcome to her,
for a double reason.  She feared, in the first place, lest it should mean a separation from
Bob, who was her faithful companion, and fulfilled his promise of friendship in a silent, undemonstrative
fashion, much to her fancy.  In the second place, she was conscious of a rankling feeling of
jealousy towards the young lady who was distinguished by the name of the Honourable Rosalind,
and who seemed to occupy an exalted position in the estimation of the vicar's daughters.  Her
name was frequently introduced into conversation, and always in the most laudatory fashion.
When a heroine was of a superlatively fascinating description, she was "Just like Rosalind";
when an article of dress was unusually fine and dainty, it would "do for Rosalind."  Rosalind
was spoken of with bated breath, as if she were a princess in a fairy tale, rather than an
ordinary flesh-and-blood damsel.  And Peggy did not like it; she did not like it at all, for,
in her own quiet way, she was accustomed to queen it among her associates, and could ill brook
the idea of a rival.  She had not been happy at school, but she had been complacently conscious
that of all the thirty girls she was the most discussed, the most observed, and also, among
the pupils themselves, the most beloved.  At the vicarage she was an easy first.  When the
three girls went out walking, she was always in the middle, with Esther and Mellicent hanging
on an arm at either side.  Robert was her sworn vassal, and Max and Oswald her respectful and,
on the whole, obedient servants.  Altogether, the prospect of playing second fiddle to this
strange girl was by no means pleasant.  Peggy tilted her chin, and spoke in a cool, cynical tone.

"What is she like, this wonderful Rosalind?  Bob does not seem to think her extraordinary.
I cannot imagine a `Miss Robert' being very beautiful, and as she is his sister, I suppose
they are alike."

Instantly there arose a duet of protests.

"Not in the least.  Not a single bit.  Rosalind is lovely!  Blue eyes, golden hair--"

"Down past her waist--"

"The sweetest little hands--"

"A real diamond ring--"

"Pink cheeks--"

"Drives a pony-carriage, with long-tailed ponies--"

"Speaks French all day long with her governess--jabber, jabber, jabber, as quick as that--just
like a native--"

"Plays the violin--"

"Has a lovely little sitting-room of her own, simply crammed with the most exquisite presents
and books, and goes travelling abroad to France and Italy and hot places in winter.  Lord and
Lady Darcy simply worship her, and so does everyone, for she is as beautiful as a picture.
Don't you think it would be lovely to have a lord and lady for your father and mother?"

Peggy sniffed the air in scornful superiority.

"I am very glad I've not!  Titles are so ostentatious!  Vulgar, I call them!  The very best
families will have nothing to do with them.  My father's people were all at the Crusades, and
the Wars of the Roses, and the Field of the Cloth of Gold.  There is no older family in England,
and they are called `Fighting Savilles,' because they are always in the front of every battle,
winning honours and distinctions.  I expect they have been offered titles over and over again,
but they would not have them.  They refused them with scorn, and so would I if one were offered
to me.  Nothing would induce me to accept it!"

Esther rolled her eyes in a comical, sideway fashion, and gave a little chuckle of unbelief;
but Mellicent looked quite depressed by this reception of her grand news, and said anxiously--

"But, Peggy, think of it!  The Honourable Mariquita!  It would be too lovely!  Wouldn't you
feel proud writing it in visitors' books, and seeing it printed in newspapers when you grow
up?  `The Honourable Mariquita wore a robe of white satin, trimmed with gold!'"

"Peggy Saville is good enough for me, thank you," said that young lady, with a sudden access
of humility.  "I have no wish to have my clothes discussed in the public prints.  But if you
are invited to the Larches to play with your Rosalind, pray don't consider me!  I can stay
at home alone.  I don't mind being dull.  I can turn my time to good account. Not for the world
would I interfere with your pleasure?"

"But P-P-Peggy, dar-ling Peggy, we would not leave you alone!" Mellicent's eyes were wide with
horror, she stretched out entreating hands towards the unresponsive figure.  To see Peggy cross
and snappish like--any other ordinary mortal was an extraordinary event, and quite alarming
to her placid mind.  "They will ask you, too, dear!  I am sure they will--we will all be asked
together!" she cried; but Peggy tossed her head, refusing to be conciliated.

"I shall have a previous engagement.  I am not at all sure that they are the sort of people
I ought to know," she said.  "My parents are so exclusive!  They might not approve of the acquaintance!"

CHAPTER TEN.

AMBITIONS!

Although Fraulein had charge over the girls' education, Mr Asplin reserved to himself the right
of superintending their studies and dictating their particular direction.  He was so accustomed
to training boys for a definite end that he had no patience with the ordinary aimless routine
of a girl's school course, and in the case of his daughters had carefully provided for their
different abilities and tastes.  Esther was a born student, a clear-headed, hard-thinking girl,
who took a delight in wrestling with Latin verbs and in solving problems in Euclid, while she
had little or no artistic faculty.  He put her through much the same course as his own boys,
gave her half an hour's private lesson on unoccupied afternoons, and cut down the two hours'
practising on the piano to a bare thirty minutes.  Esther had pleaded to give up music altogether,
on the ground that she had neither love nor skill for this accomplishment, but to this the
vicar would not agree.

"You have already spent much time over it, and have passed the worst of the drudgery; it would
be folly to lose all you have learnt," he said. "You may not wish to perform in public, but
there are many other ways in which your music may be useful.  In time to come you would be
sorry if you could not read an accompaniment to a song, play bright airs to amuse children,
or hymn tunes to help in a service.  Half an hour a day will keep up what you have learned,
and so much time you must manage to spare."

With Mellicent the case was almost exactly opposite.  It was a waste of time trying to teach
her mathematics, she had not sufficient brain power to grasp them, and if she succeeded in
learning a proposition by heart like a parrot, it was only to collapse into helpless tears
and protestations when the letters were altered, and, as it seemed to her, the whole argument
changed thereby.

Fraulein protested that it was impossible to teach Mellicent to reason; but the vicar was loath
to give up his pet theory that girls should receive the same hard mental training as their
brothers.  He declared that if the girl were weak in this direction, it was all the more necessary
that she should be trained, and volunteered to take her in hand for half an hour daily, to
see what could be done.  Fraulein accepted this offer with a chuckle of satisfaction, and the
vicar went on with the lessons several weeks, patiently plodding over the same ground without
making the least impression on poor Mellicent's brain, until there came one happy never-to-be-forgotten
morning when Algebra and Euclid went spinning up to the ceiling, and he jumped from the table
with a roar of helpless laughter.

"Oh, baby! baby! this is past all bearing!  We might try for a century, and never get any further.
I cannot waste any more time."  Then, seeing the large tears gathering, he framed the pretty
face in his hands, and looked at it with a tender smile.  "Never mind, darling! there are better
things in this world than being clever and learned.  You will be our little house-daughter;
help mother with her work, and play and sing to father when he is tired in the evening.  Work
hard at your music, learn how to manage a house, to sew and mend and cook, and you will have
nothing to regret.  A woman who can make a home, has done more than many scholars."

So it came to pass that Mellicent added the violin to her accomplishments, and was despatched
to her own room to practise exercises, while her elder sister wrestled with problems and equations.

  Nerissa read her part "conscientiously,"
as the newspapers would say, punctuating her sentences in exemplary fashion, and laying the
emphasis upon the right words as directed by the stage manageress; but, such is the contrariness
of things, that, with all her efforts, the effect was stiff and stifled, while Peggy drawled
through her sentences, or gabbled them over at break-neck speed, used no emphasis at all, or
half a dozen running, at her own sweet will, and was so truly Portia that the vicar wondered
dreamily if he should have to interview the Duke of Morocco in his study, and Mrs Asplin sighed
unconsciously, and told herself that the child was too young to be troubled with lovers.  She
must not dream of accepting any one of them for years to come!

At the end of the scene, however, anxiety about her beloved portiere overpowered everything
else in the mind of the vicar's wife, and she rushed after the actors to call out eager instructions.
"Hang it up at once--there's good children.  If you put it down on a chair, Peggy will sit
on it as sure as fate!  And oh! my table centres!  Put them back in the drawer if you love
me!  Wrap them up in the tissue paper as you found them!"

"Mother, you are a terrible person!  Go back, there's a dear, and do keep quiet!" cried a muffled
voice from behind the dining-room door, as Shylock dodged back to escape observation; and Mrs
Asplin retreated hastily, aghast at the sight of a hairy monster, in whom she failed to recognise
a trace of her beloved son and heir.  Shylock's make-up was, in truth, the triumph of the evening.
The handsome lad had been transformed into a bent, misshapen old man, and anything more ugly,
frowsy, and generally unattractive than he now appeared it would be impossible to imagine.
A cushion gave a hump to his shoulders, and over this he wore an aged purple dressing-gown,
which had once belonged to the vicar.  The dressing-gown was an obvious refuge; but who but
Peggy Saville would have thought of the trimming, which was the making of the shaggy, unkempt
look so much desired?  Peggy had sat with her hands clasped on her lap, and her head on one
side, staring at the gown when it was held out for her approval two days before, then had suddenly
risen, and rushed two steps at a time upstairs to the topmost landing, a wide, scantily furnished
space which served for a playground on wet afternoons.  An oilcloth covered the floor, a table
stood in a corner, and before each of the six doors was an aged wool rug, maroon as to colouring,
with piebald patches here and there where the skin of the lining showed through the scanty
tufts.  Peggy gave a whoop of triumph, tucked one after the other beneath her arm, and went
flying down again, dropping a mat here and there, tripping over it, and nearly falling from
top to bottom of the stairs.  Hairbreadth escapes were, however, so much a part of her daily
existence that she went on her way unperturbed, and carried her bundle into the study, where
the girls sniffed derisively, and the boys begged to know what she intended to do with all
that rubbish.

"`They that have no invention should be hanged,'" quoted Peggy, unperturbed.  "Give me a packet
of pins, and I'll soon show you what I am going to do.  Dear, dear, dear, I don't know what
you would do without me!  You are singularly bereft of imagination."

She tossed her pigtail over her shoulder, armed herself with the largest pins she could find,
and set to work to fasten the mats down the front of the gown, and round the hem at the bottom,
so that the wool hung in shaggy ends over the feet.  The skins were thick, the heads of the
pins pressed painfully into her fingers, but she groaned and worked away until the border was
arranged for stitching, and could be tried on to show the effect.

"Perfectly splendid!" was the verdict of the beholders.  And so the matter of Shylock's gown
was settled; but his beard still remained to be provided, and was by no means an easy problem
to solve.

"Tow!" suggested Mellicent; but the idea was hooted by all the others. The idea of Shylock
as a blonde was too ridiculous to be tolerated. False hair was not to be bought in a small
village, and Maxwell's youthful face boasted as yet only the faintest shadow of a moustache.

The question was left over for consideration, and an inspiration came the same afternoon, when
Robert hurled one of the roller-like cushions of the sofa at Oswald's head, and Oswald, in
catching it, tore loose a portion of the covering.

"Now you've done it!" he cried.  "The room will be covered with feathers, and then you will
say it was my fault!  We shall have to fasten the stupid thing up somehow or other!"  He peered
through the opening as he spoke, and his face changed.  "It's not feathers--it's horsehair!
Here's a find!  What about that wig for Shylock?"

Esther was dubious.

"It would take a great deal of horsehair to make a wig.  It would spoil the cushion if the
horsehair were taken away; it would spoil the sofa if the cushion were small; it would spoil
the room if the sofa--"

Peggy interrupted with a shriek of laughter.  "Oh, oh, oh!  It's like the `House that Jack
built'!  How long do you intend to go on like that? Nonsense, my dear!  It would be perfectly
easy to take out what we want, and put it back afterwards.  I'll promise to do it myself and
sew it up tightly, though, if you desire my opinion, I think the cushion would be improved
by letting in a little air.  You might as well lean your head on a brick.  Max, you are a made
man!  You shall have a beautiful, crinkly black wig, and a beard to match!  We will sew them
to your turban, and fasten them with black elastic.  It will never show, and I'll finish off
the joins after you are dressed.  You'll see?"

"You can do as you like!  I'm in your hands!" said Max easily; and when the night of the reading
arrived, and he was attired in wig and gown, Peggy seated him in a chair and tucked a towel
under his chin with an air of business.  She had a number of small accessories on a table near
at hand, and Max was first instructed to stick pieces of black plaster over alternate teeth,
so that he might appear to possess only a few isolated fangs, and then made to lie back in
his chair, while his dresser stood over him with a glue-brush in one hand and a bunch of loose
horsehair in the other.

"Shut your eyes!" she cried loudly.  And before he could say "Jack Robinson" a tuft of the
wiry stuff covered his eyebrow.  "Keep your face still!"  And, to his horror, the gum was daubed
from the borders of the beard, halfway up to his eyes, and little prickly ends of hair were
held in Peggy's palm and pressed against his cheeks until they were firmly attached.

This, indeed, was more than he had bargained for!  He jerked back his head, and began a loud-voiced
protest, only to be interrupted by shrieks of excitement.

"Oh, oh, oh!  It's beautiful--beautiful!  What a fright!  What a delicious fright!  No one
would know you!  You look an old hairy monster who would gobble up half a dozen Christians.
Do look at yourself!"

Peggy felt the pride of an artist in the result of her efforts, and Max was hardly less delighted
than herself as he stood before the glass, gazing at his hairy cheeks and leering horribly,
to admire his toothless gums.  If the result were so hideous as to astonish even those who
had watched the process of his make-up, what wonder that the effect upon Shylock's fond parents
was of a stupefying nature!

Horror kept Mrs Asplin silent until the middle of the scene between Shylock and Antonio when
the bond is signed, and then her agitation could no longer be controlled, and Shylock's little
speeches were interrupted by entreaties to take that horrid stuff off his teeth, to use plenty
of hot water in washing his face, and to be sure to anoint it plentifully with cold cream after
doing so.

An ordinary lad would have lost his temper at these interruptions; but Max adored his mother,
and could never take anything she did in a wrong spirit.  Anger being therefore impossible,
the only other resource was to laugh, which, in Peggy's opinion, was even worse than the former.
A Shylock who chuckled between his speeches, and gave a good-humoured "Ha! ha!" just before
uttering his bitterest invective, was a ridiculous parody of the character, with whom it would
be impossible to act.  It would be hard indeed if all her carefully rehearsed speeches lost
their effect, and the famous trial scene were made into a farce through these untimely interruptions!

The second part of the play went more smoothly, however, as the audience settled down to a
more attentive hearing, and the actors became less self-conscious and embarrassed.  If four
out of the six were sticks, who never for a moment approached the verge of the natural, Portia
and Shylock did nobly, and, when the reading was over and the young people gathered round the
fire in the drawing-room, it was unanimously agreed that they had acquired a more intimate
knowledge of the play by this one evening's representation than by weeks of ordinary study.

"I feel so much more intimate with it!" said Esther.  "It seems to have made it alive, instead
of just something I have read in a book.  It was a delightful thought, father, and I am grateful
to you for proposing it. I wish I could do all my lessons in the same way."

"I've not enjoyed myself so much for ages.  You just did beautifully, all of you, and the dresses
were a sight to behold.  As for Peggy, she's a witch, and could make up costumes on a desert
island, if she were put to it!  But I don't know what is going to happen to my poor, dear boy's
face.  Oswald, what is he doing?  Isn't he coming to have some lemonade and cake?" asked Mrs
Asplin anxiously.  And Oswald chuckled in a heartless fashion.

"Pride must abide.  He would be Shylock, whether we liked it or not, so let him take the consequences.
He is fighting it out with cold cream in the bathroom, and some of the horsehair sticks like
fun.  I'll go up and tell him we have eaten all the cake.  He was getting savage when I came
down, and it will sweeten his temper!"

CHAPTER TWELVE.

PEGGY IN TROUBLE.

As Peggy sat writing in the study one afternoon, a shaggy head came peering round the door,
and Robert's voice said eagerly--"Mariquita!  A word in your ear!  Could you come out and take
a turn round the garden for half an hour before tea, or are you too busy?"

"Not at all.  I am entirely at your disposal," said Peggy elegantly; and the young people made
their way to the cloak-room, swung on coats and sailor hats, and sallied out into the fresh
autumn air.

"Mariquita," said Robert then, using once more the name by which he chose to address Peggy
in their confidential confabs, "Mariquita, I am in difficulties!  There is a microscope advertised
in Science this week, that is the very thing I have been pining for for the last six years.
I must get it, or die; but the question is--how?  You see before you a penniless man."  He
looked at Peggy as he spoke, and met her small, demure smile.

"My dear and honourable sir--"

"Yes, yes, I know; drop that, Mariquita!  Don't take for granted, like Mellicent, that because
a man has a title he must necessarily be a millionaire.  Everything is comparative!  My father
is rich compared to the vicar, but he is really hard-up for a man in his position.  He gets
almost no rent for his land nowadays, and I am the third son.  I haven't as much pocket-money
in a month as Oswald gets through in a week.  Now that microscope costs twenty pounds, and
if I were to ask the governor for it, he wouldn't give it to me, but he would sigh and look
wretched at being obliged to refuse.  He's a kind-hearted fellow, you know, who doesn't like
to say `No,' and I hate to worry him.  Still--that microscope!  I must have it.  By hook or
by crook, I must have it.  I've set my mind on that."

"I'm sure I hope you will, though for my part you must not expect me to look through it.  I
like things to be pretty, and when you see them through a microscope they generally look hideous.
I saw my own hand once--ugh!"  Peggy shuddered.  "Twenty pounds!  Well, I can only say that
my whole worldly wealth is at your disposal.  Draw on me for anything you like--up to seven-and-six!
That's all the money I have till the beginning of the month."

"Thanks!--I didn't intend to borrow; I have a better idea than that.  I was reading a magazine
the other day, and came upon a list of prize competitions.  The first prize offered was thirty
pounds, and I'm going to win that prize!  The microscope costs only twenty pounds, but the
extra ten would come in usefully for--I'll tell you about that later on! The Piccadilly Magazine
is very respectable and all that sort of thing; but the governor is one of the good, old-fashioned,
conservative fellows, who would be horrified if he saw my name figuring in it.  I'm bound to
consider his feelings, but all the same I'm going to win that prize.  It says in the rules--I've
read them through carefully--that you can ask your friends to help you, so that there would
be nothing unfair about going into partnership with someone else.  What I was going to suggest
was that you and I should collaborate.  I'd rather work with you than with any of the others,
and I think we could manage it rather well between us.  Our contribution should be sent in
in your name; that is to say, if you wouldn't object to seeing yourself in print."

"I should love it.  I'm proud of my name; and it would be a new sensation."  But Peggy spoke
in absent-minded fashion, as if her thoughts were running on another subject.  Rob had used
a word which was unfamiliar in her ears, a big word, a word with a delightful intellectual
roll, and she had not the remotest idea of its meaning. Collaborate!  Beautiful!  Not for worlds
would she confess her ignorance, yet the opportunity could not be thrown away.  She must secure
the treasure, and add it to her mental store.  She put her head on one side, and said pensively--

"I shall be most happy to er--er--In what other words can I express `collaborate,' Rob?  I
object to repetition?"

"Go shags!" returned Robert briefly.  "I would do the biggest part of the work, of course--that's
only fair, because I want two-thirds of the money--but you could do what you liked, and have
ten pounds for your share.  Ten pounds would come in very usefully for Christmas."

"Rather!  I'd get mother and father lovely presents, and Mrs Asplin too; and buy books for
Esther, and a little gold ring for Mellicent-- it's her idea of happiness to have a gold ring.
I'll help you with pleasure, Rob, and I'm sure we shall get the prize.  What have we to do?
Compose some poetry?"

"Goodness, no!  Fancy me making up poetry!  It's to make up a calendar. There are subjects
given for each month--sorrow, love, obedience, resignation--that sort of thing, and you have
to give a quotation for each day.  It will take some time, but we ought to stand a good chance.
You are fond of reading, and know no end of poetry, and where I have a pull is in knowing French
and German so well.  I can give them some fine translations from the Latin and Greek too, for
the matter of that, and put the authors' names underneath.  That will impress the judges, and
make 'em decide in our favour.  I've been working at it only three days, and I've got over
fifty quotations already.  We must keep note-books in our pockets, and jot down any ideas that
occur to us during the day, and go over them together at night.  You will know a lot, I'm sure."

"That's it!  That's the style!  Something with a bit of a sermon in it to keep 'em up to the
mark for the day.  Bravo, Mariquita! you'll do it splendidly.  That's settled, then.  We shall
have to work hard, for there is only a month before it must be sent off, and we must finish
in good time.  When you leave things to the last, something is bound to come in the way.  It
will take an age to write out three hundred and sixty-five extracts."

"It will indeed, for they must be very nicely done," said Peggy fastidiously.  "Of course it
is most important that the extracts themselves should be good, but it matters almost as much
that they should look neat and attractive.  Appearances go such a long way."  And when Robert
demurred, and stated his opinion that the judges would not trouble their heads about looks,
she stuck firmly to her point.

"Oh, won't they, though!  Just imagine how you would feel if you were in their position, and
had to look over scores of ugly, uninteresting manuscripts.  You would be bored to death, and,
after plodding conscientiously through a few dozen, you would get so mixed up that you would
hardly be able to distinguish one from another.  Then suddenly-- suddenly,"--Peggy clasped
her hands with one of her favourite dramatic gestures--"you would see before you a dainty little
volume, prettily written, easy to read, easy to hold, nice to look at, and do you mean to say
that your heart wouldn't give a jump, and that you would not take a fancy to the writer from
that very moment?  Of course you would; and so, if you please, I am going to look after the
decorative department, and see what can be done.  I must give my mind to it--Oh!  I'll tell
you what would be just the thing.  When I was in the library one day lately I saw some sweet
little note-books with pale green leaves and gilt edges.  I'll count the pages, and buy enough
to make up three hundred and sixty-five, and twelve extra, so as to put one plain sheet between
each month.  Then we must have a cover.  Two pieces of cardboard would do, with gilt edges,
and a motto in Old English letters--`The months in circling-orbit fly.'  Have I read that somewhere,
or did I make it up? It sounds very well.  Well, what next?"  Peggy was growing quite excited,
and the restless hands were waving about at a great rate.  "Oh, the pages!  We shall have to
put the date at the top of each.  I could do that in gold ink, and make a pretty little skriggle--
er--`arabesque' I should say, underneath, to give it a finish.  Then I'd hand them on to you
to write the extracts in your tiny little writing.  Rob, it will be splendid!  Do you really
think we shall get the prize?"

"I mean to get it!  We have a good library here, and plenty of time, if we like to use it.
I'm going to get up at six every morning.  I shan't fail for want of trying, and if I miss
this I'll win something else.  My mind is made up!  I'm going to buy that microscope!"  Robert
tossed his head and looked ferocious, while Peggy peered in his rugged face, and, womanlike,
admired him the more for his determination.

They lingered in the garden discussing details, planning out the work, and arranging as to
the different books to be overlooked until the tea hour was passed, and Mrs Asplin came to
the door and called to them to come in.

"And nothing on your feet but your thin slippers?  Oh, you Peggy!" she exclaimed in despair.
"Now you will have a cold, and ten to one it will fly to your throat.  I shall have to line
you a penny every time you cross the doorstep without changing your shoes.  Summer is over,
remember.  You can't be too careful in these raw, damp days.  Run upstairs this minute and
change your stockings."

Peggy looked meek, and went to her room at once to obey orders; but the mischief was done--she
shivered, and could not get warm, her head ached, and her eyes felt heavy.  Mrs Asplin looked
anxiously at her in the drawing-room after dinner, and finally called her to her side.

"Peggy, come here!  Aren't you well?  Let me feel your hand.  Child, it's like a coal!  You
are in a fever.  Why didn't you tell me at once?"

"Because I--really, it's nothing, Mrs Asplin!  Don't be worried.  I don't know why I feel so
hot.  I was shivering only a minute ago."

"Go straight upstairs and take a dose of ammoniated quinine.  Turn on the fire in your room.
Max!  Robert!  Oswald!  Esther!  Mellicent! will everyone please look after Peggy in the future,
and see that she does not run out in her slippers!" cried Mrs Asplin in a despairing voice;
and Peggy bolted out of the door, in haste to escape before more reproaches could be hurled
at her head.

But an alarm of a more serious nature than a threatened cold was to take place before the evening
was over.  The young people answered briefly, Mrs Asplin turned back to her book, and silence
settled down upon the occupants of the drawing-room.  It was half-past eight, the servants
had carried away the dinner things, and were enjoying their evening's rest in the kitchen.
The vicar was nodding in his easy-chair, the house was so quiet that the tick of the old grandfather
clock in the hall could be heard through the half-opened door.  Then suddenly came the sound
of flying footsteps, the door burst open, and in rushed Peggy once more,-- but such a Peggy,
such an apparition of fear, suffering, and terror as brought a cry of consternation from every
lip.  Her eyes were starting from her head, her face was contorted in spasmodic gaspings for
breath, her arms sawed the air like the sails of a windmill, and she flew round and round the
room in a wild, unheeding rush.

"Peggy, my child! my child! what is the matter?  Oh, Austin--oh!  What shall we do?" cried
Mrs Asplin, trying to catch hold of the flying arms, only to be waved off with frenzied energy.
Mellicent dissolved into tears and retreated behind the sofa, under the impression that Peggy
had suddenly taken leave of her senses, and practical Esther rushed upstairs to search for
a clue to the mystery among the medicine bellies on Peggy's table.  She was absent only for
a few minutes; but it seemed like an hour to the watchers, for Peggy's face grew more and more
agonised, she seemed on the verge of suffocation, and could neither speak nor endure anyone
to approach within yards of her mad career. Presently, however, she began to falter, to draw
her breath in longer gasps, and as she did so there emerged from her lips a series of loud
whooping sounds, like the crowing of a cock, or the noise made by a child in the convulsions
of whooping-cough.  The air was making its way to the lungs after the temporary stoppage, and
the result would have been comical if any of the hearers had been in a mood for jesting, which,
in good truth, they were not.

"Thank Heaven!  She will be better now.  Open the window and leave her alone.  Don't try to
make her speak.  What in the world has the child been doing?" cried the vicar wonderingly;
and at that moment Esther entered, bearing in her hand the explanation of the mystery--a bottle
labelled "Spirits of Ammonia," and a tumbler about an eighth full of a white milky-looking fluid.

"They were in the front of the table.  The other things had not been moved.  I believe she
has never looked at the labels, but seized the first bottle that came to her hand--this dreadfully
strong ammonia which you gave her for the gnat bites when she first came."

A groan of assent came from the sofa on which Peggy lay, choking no longer, but ghastly white,
and drawing her breath in painful gasps. Mrs Asplin sniffed at the contents of the tumbler,
only to jerk back her head with watery eyes and reddened lips.

"No wonder that the child was nearly choked!  The marvel is that she had ever regained her
breath after such a mistake.  Her throat must be raw!" She hurried out of the room to concoct
a soothing draught, at which Peggy supped at intervals during the evening, croaking out a hoarse,
"Better, thank you!" in reply to inquiries, and looking so small and pathetic in her nest of
cushions that the hearts of the beholders softened at the sight.  Before bedtime, however,
she revived considerably, and, her elastic spirits coming to her aid, entertained the listeners
with a husky but dramatic account of her proceedings.  How she had not troubled to turn the
gas full up, and had just seized the bottle, tilted some of the contents into a tumbler in
which there was a small portion of water, without troubling to measure it out, and gulped it
down without delay.  Her description of the feelings which ensued was a really clever piece
of word-painting, but behind the pretence of horror at her own carelessness there rang a hardly
concealed note of pride, as though, in thus risking her life, she had done something quite
clever and distinguished.

Mrs Asplin exhausted herself in "Ohs!" and "Ahs!" of sympathy, and had nothing harsher to say
than--

"Well now, dearie, you'll be more careful another time, won't you?"  But the vicar's long face
grew longer than ever as he listened, and the lines deepened in his forehead.  Peggy was inexperienced
in danger-signals, but Esther and Mellicent recognised the well-known signs, and were at no
loss to understand the meaning of that quiet, "A word with you in the study, Mariquita, if
you please!" with which he rose from the breakfast-table next morning.

Peggy's throat was still sore, and she fondly imagined that anxiety on its behalf was the cause
of the summons, but she was speedily undeceived, for the vicar motioned towards a chair, and
said, in short grave sentences, as his manner was when annoyed--

"I wish to speak to you about the event of last night; I am afraid that you hardly realise
the matter in its true light.  I was not at all pleased with the manner in which you gave your
explanation.  You appeared to imagine that you had done something clever and amusing.  I take
a very different view.  You showed a reprehensible carelessness in trifling with medicines
in the dark; it might have caused you your life, or, at best, a serious injury.  As it was,
you brought pain upon yourself, and gave us all a serious alarm.  I see nothing amusing in
such behaviour, but consider it stupid, and careless to an almost criminal extent."

Peggy stood motionless, eyes cast down, hands clasped before her--a picture of injured innocence.
She did not say a word in self-defence, but her feelings were so plainly written on her face
that the vicar's eyes flashed with impatience.

"Well, what have you to say?"

Peggy sighed in dolorous fashion.

"I am sorry; I know it was careless.  I am always doing things like that.  So is Arthur.  So
was father when he was a boy.  It's in the family.  It's unfortunate, but--"

"Mariquita," said the vicar sternly, "you are not sorry!  If I had seen that you were penitent,
I should not have spoken, for you would have been sufficiently punished by your own sufferings,
but you are not sorry; you are, on the whole, rather proud of the escapade!  Look into your
own heart and see if it is not so?"

He paused, looking at her with grave, expectant eyes, but there was no sign of conviction upon
the set face.  The eyes were still lowered, the lips drooped with an expression of patient
endurance.  There was silence in the room while Peggy studied the carpet, and the vicar gazed
at her downcast face.  A moment before he had been on the verge of anger, but the sternness
melted away in that silence, and gave place to an anxious tenderness.  Here was a little human
soul committed to his care--how could he help? how best guide and train?  The long, grave face
grew beautiful in that moment with the expression which it wore every Sunday as he gazed around
the church at the beginning of the sermon, noting this one and that, having a swift realisation
of their needs and failings, and breathing a prayer to God that He would give to his lips the
right word, to his heart the right thought, to meet the needs of his people.  Evidently, sternness
and outspoken blame was not the best way to touch the girl before him.  He must try another mode.

"Peggy," he said quietly, "do you think you realise what a heavy responsibility we laid upon
ourselves when we undertook the care of you for these three years?  If any accident happened
to you beneath our roof, have you ever imagined what would be our misery and remorse at sending
the news to your parents?  About their feelings I do not speak; you can realise them for yourself.
We safeguard you with every precaution in our power; we pray morning and night that you may
be preserved in safety; is it too much to ask that you will do your part by showing more forethought,
and by exercising some little care in the daily duties of life?  I ask it for our sakes as
well as your own."

A pink flush spread over Peggy's cheeks; she gulped nervously and raised her eyes to the vicar's
face.  Twice her lips opened as if to speak, but the natural reserve, which made it agony to
her to express her deepest feelings, closed them again before a word had been spoken.  The
question was not answered, but a little hand shot out and nestled in Mr Asplin's with a spasmodic
grip which was full of eloquence.

"Yes, dear, I know you will!  I know you will!" he said, answering the unspoken promise, and
looking down at her with one of his sweet, kindly smiles.  "It will be a comfort to my wife
as well as myself.  She is very nervous about you.  She was upstairs three times in the night,
to satisfy herself that you were well after your fright, and is too tired herself to come downstairs
this morning.  She is always bright and cheery, but she is not very strong.  You would be sorry
to make her ill."

No answer, only another grip of the hand, and a sudden straightening of the lips, as if they
were pressed together to avoid an involuntary trembling.  There is something especially touching
in the sight of restrained emotion; and as the vicar thought of his own two daughters, his
heart was very tender over the girl whose parents were separated from her by six thousand miles
of land and sea.

"Well now, dear, I have said my say, and that is an end of it.  I don't like finding fault,
but my dear wife has thrown that duty on my shoulders by being too tender-hearted to say a
word of blame even when it is needed.  Her method works very well, as a rule, but there are
occasions when it would be criminal to withhold a just reprimand."  The vicar stopped short,
and a spasm of laughter crossed his face.  Peggy's fingers had twitched within his own as he
spoke those last two words, and her eyes had dilated with interest.  He knew as well as if
he had been told that she was gloating over the new expression, and mentally noting it for
future use.  Nothing, however, could have been sweeter or more natural than the manner in which
she sidled against him, and murmured--

"Thank you so much.  I am sorry!  I will truly try;" and he watched her out of the room with
a smile of tender amusement.

"A nice child--a good child--feels deeply.  I can rely upon her to do her best."

Robert was hanging about in the passage, ready, as usual, to fulfil his vows of support, and
Peggy slid her hand through his arm and sauntered slowly with him towards the schoolroom. 
Like the two girls, he had been at no loss to understand the reason of the call to the study,
and would fain have expressed his sympathy, but Peggy stopped him with uplifted finger.

"No, no--he was perfectly right.  You must not blame him.  I have been guilty of reprehensible
carelessness, and merited a reprimand!"

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

JEALOUS THOUGHTS.

Peggy felt weak and shaken for some days after her fright, and was thankful to stay quietly
indoors and busy herself with her new task. The gas-fire could be turned on in her room whenever
she desired, and at every spare moment she ran upstairs, locked her door behind her, and began
to write.  Robert insisted that the work should be kept secret, and that not a word should
be said about the competition downstairs, for he was sensitive about the remarks of his companions,
and anxious to keep a possible failure to himself.  All the work had to be done upstairs, therefore,
and the frequent absence of the partners from the schoolroom, though much regretted, did not
seem at all inexplicable to the others.  It was understood that Peggy and Robert had some interest
in common; but as winter advanced this was no unusual occurrence in a house where Christmas
was a carnival, and surprises of an elaborate nature were planned by every member of the household.
It was taken for granted that the work had some connection with Christmas, and inquiries were
discreetly avoided.

With an old calendar before her as a model for the lettering, Peggy did her work neatly and
well, and the gilt "arabesques" had an artistic flourish which was quite professional.  When
Robert was shown the first half-dozen sheets he whistled with surprise, and exclaimed, "Good
old Mariquita!" a burst of approval before which Peggy glowed with delight. It had been agreed
that, after printing the first ten days of January, Peggy should go on to the first ten of
February, and so on throughout the year, so that Rob should be able to use what quotations
had already been found under each heading, and should not be detained until the whole thirty
or thirty-one had been chosen.

The partners were most fastidious in their selection at the beginning of their work; but when
half the time had passed, and not one-third of the necessary number of quotations had been
found, alarm seized upon the camp, and it was realised that a little more latitude must be shown.

"We shall have to use up all the old ones which we struck off the list," said Rob disconsolately.
"I'm sorry; but I never realised before that three hundred and sixty-five was such an outrageously
large number.  And we shall have to get books of extracts, and read them through from beginning
to end.  Nearly two hundred more to find; a hundred and fifty, say, when we have used up those
old ones!  It will take us all our time!"

"I'll get up at six every morning and read by my fire," said Peggy firmly.  "If it's necessary,
I'll get up at five, and if I can't find bits to suit all the stupid old things, I'll--I'll
write some myself! There!  Why shouldn't I?  I often make up things in my head, and you wouldn't
believe how fine they are.  I think of them days afterwards, and ask myself, `Now where did
I read that?' and then it comes back to me.  `Dear me; I made it up myself!'  If we get very
short, Rob, there wouldn't be any harm in writing a few sentences and signing them `Saville,'
would there?"

"Not if they were good enough," said Rob, trying to suppress the laugh which would have hurt
Peggy's feelings, and looking with twinkling eyes at the little figure by his side, so comically
unprofessional, with her lace collar, dainty little feet, and pigtail of dark brown hair.

"You mustn't get up too early in the morning and overtire yourself.  I can't allow that!" he
added firmly.  "You have looked like a little white ghost the last few days, and your face
is about the size of my hand.  You must get some colour into your cheeks before the holidays,
or that beloved Arthur will think we have been ill-treating you when he comes down."

Peggy gave a sharp sigh, and relapsed into silence.  It was the rarest thing in the world to
hear her allude to any of her own people.  When a letter arrived, and Mrs Asplin asked questions
concerning father, mother, or brother, she answered readily enough, but she never offered information,
or voluntarily carried on the conversation.  Friends less sympathetic might have imagined that
she was so happy in her new home that she had no care beyond it, but no one in the vicarage
made that mistake.  When the Indian letter was handed to her across the breakfast-table, the
flush of delight on the pale cheeks brought a reflected smile to every face, and more than
one pair of eyes watched her tenderly as she sat hugging the precious letter, waiting until
the moment should come when she could rush upstairs and devour its contents in her own room.
Once it had happened that mail day had arrived and brought no letter, and that had been a melancholy
occasion.  Mrs Asplin had looked at one envelope after another, had read the addresses twice,
thrice, even four times over, before she summoned courage to tell of its absence.

"There is no letter for you to-day, Peggy!"  Her voice was full of commiseration as she spoke,
but Peggy sat in silence, her face stiffened, her head thrown back with an assumption of calm
indifference. "There must have been some delay in the mail.  You will have two letters next
week, dearie, instead of one."

"Probably," said Peggy.  Mellicent was staring at her with big, round eyes; the vicar peered
over the rim of his spectacles; Esther passed the marmalade with eager solicitude; her friends
were all full of sympathy, but there was a "Touch-me-if-you-dare!" atmosphere about Peggy that
day which silenced the words on their lips.  It was evident that she preferred to be left alone,
and though her eyes were red when she came down to lunch, she held her chin so high, and joined
in the conversation with such an elegant flow of language, that no one dare comment on the
fact.  Two days later the letter arrived, and all was sunshine again; but, in spite of her
cheery spirits, her friends realised that Peggy's heart was not in the vicarage, and that there
were moments when the loneliness of her position pressed on her, and when she longed intensely
for someone of her very own, whose place could not be taken by even the kindest of friends.

Like most undemonstrative people, Peggy dearly loved to be appreciated, and to receive marks
of favour from those around.  Half the zest with which she entered into her new labour was
owing to the fact that Robert had chosen her from all the rest to be his partner.  She was
aglow with satisfaction in this fact, and with pleasure in the work itself, and the only cloud
which darkened her horizon at the present moment was caused by those incidental references
to the fair Rosalind which fell so often from her companions' lips.

"Everything," said Peggy impatiently to herself, "everything ends in Rosalind!  Whatever we
are talking about, that stupid girl's name is bound to be introduced!  I asked Mellicent if
she would have a scone at tea this afternoon, and she said something about Rosalind in reply--
Rosalind liked scones, or she didn't like scones, or some ridiculous nonsense of the sort!
Who wants to know what Rosalind likes?  I don't! I'm sick of the name!  And Mrs Asplin is as
silly as the rest!  The girls must have new dresses because Rosalind is coming, and they will
be asked to tea at the Larches!  If their green dresses are good enough for us, why won't they
do for Rosalind, I should like to know?  Rob is the only sensible one.  I asked him if she
were really such a marvellous creature, and he said she was an affected goose!  He ought to
know better than anyone else!  Curls indeed!  One would think it was something extraordinary
to have curls!  My hair would curl too, if I chose to make it, but I don't; I prefer to have
it straight!  If she is the `Honourable Rosalind,' I am Mariquita Saville, and I'm not going
to be patronised by anybody--so there!" and Peggy tossed her head, and glared at the reflection
in the glass in a lofty and scornful manner, as though it were the offending party who had
had the audacity to assume superiority.

Robert was one with Peggy in hoping that his people would not leave town until such time as
the calendar should be despatched on its travels, for when they were installed at the Larches
he was expected to be at home each week from Saturday until Monday, and the loss of that long
holiday afternoon would interfere seriously with the work on hand.  He had seen so little of
his people for the last few years, that he would be expected to be sociable during the short
time that he was with them, and could hardly shut himself up in his room for hours at a time.
Despair then settled down upon both partners, when a letter arrived to say that the Darcy family
were coming down even earlier than had been expected, and summoning Robert to join them at
the earliest possible moment.

"This is awful!" cried the lad, ruffling his hair with a big, restless hand.  "I know what
it means--not only Saturdays off, but two or three nights during the week into the bargain!
Between you and me, Mariquita, the governor is coming down here to economise, and intends to
stay much longer than usual.  Hector has been getting into debt again; he's the eldest, you
know--the one in the Life Guards.  It's a lot too bad, for he has had it all his own way so
far, and when he runs up bills like this, everyone has to suffer for it.  Mother hates the
country for more than a few weeks at a time, and will be wretched if she is kept here all through
the winter.  I know how it will be: she will keep asking people down, and getting up all sorts
of entertainments to relieve the dulness. It's all very well in its way, but just now when
I need every minute--"

"Shall you give up trying for the prize?" asked Peggy faintly, and Rob threw back his head
with emphatic disclaimer.

"I never give up a thing when I have made up my mind to do it!  There are ten days still, and
a great deal can be done in ten days.  I'll take a couple of books upstairs with me every night,
and see if I can find something fresh.  There is one good thing about it, I shall have a fresh
stock of books to choose from at the Larches.  It is the last step that costs in this case.
It was easy enough to fix off the first hundred, but the last is a teaser!"

On Saturday morning a dogcart came over to convey Robert to the Larches, and the atmosphere
of the vicarage seemed charged with expectation and excitement.  The Darcys had arrived; to-morrow
they would appear at church; on Monday they would probably drive over with Rob and pay a call.
These were all important facts in a quiet country life, and seemed to afford unlimited satisfaction
to every member of the household.  Peggy grew so tired of the name of Darcy that she retired
to her room at eight o'clock, and was busy at work over the September batch of cards, when
a knock came to the door, and she had to cover them over with the blotting-paper to admit Mellicent
in her dressing-gown, with her hair arranged for the night in an extraordinary number of little
plaited pigtails.

"Will you fasten the ends for me, Peggy, please?" she requested.  "When I do it, the threads
fall off, and the ends come loose.  I want it to be specially nice for to-morrow!"

"But it will look simply awful, Mellicent, if you leave it like this. It will be frizzed out
almost on a level with your head.  Let me do it up in just two tight plaits; it will be far,
far nicer," urged Peggy, lifting one little tail after another, and counting their number in
dismay.  But no, Mellicent would not be persuaded.  The extra plaits were a tribute to Rosalind,
a mark of attention to her on her arrival with which she would suffer no interference; and
as a consequence of her stubbornness she marched to church next morning disfigured by a mop
of untidy, tangled hair, instead of the usual glossy locks.

Peggy preserved a demeanour of stately calm, as she waited for the arrival of the Darcy family,
but even she felt a tremor of excitement when the verger hobbled up to the square pew and stood
holding the door open in his hand.  The heads of the villagers turned with one consent to the
doorway; only one person in the church disdained to move her position, but she heard the clatter
of horses' hoofs from without, and presently the little procession passed the vicarage pew,
and she could indulge her curiosity without sacrifice to pride.  First of all came Lord Darcy,
a thin, oldish man, with a face that looked tired and kind, and faintly amused by the amount
of attention which his entrance had attracted.  Then his wife, a tall, fair woman, with a beautiful
profile, and an air of languid discontent, who floated past with rustling silken skirts, leaving
an impression of elegance and luxury, which made Mrs Asplin sigh and Mellicent draw in her
breath with a gasp of rapture. Then followed Robert with his shaggy head, scowling more fiercely
than ever in his disgust at finding himself an object of attention, and last of all a girlish
figure in a grey dress, with a collar of soft, fluffy chinchilla, and a velvet hat with drooping
brim, beneath which could be seen a glimpse of a face pink and white as the blossoms of spring,
and a mass of shining, golden hair.  Peggy shut her lips with a snap, and the iron entered
into her soul.  It was no use pretending any longer!  This was Rosalind, and she was fairer,
sweeter, a hundred times more beautiful than she had ever imagined!

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

ROSALIND'S VISIT.

Robert did not make his appearance next morning, and his absence seemed to give fresh ground
for the expectation that Lady Darcy would drive over with him in the afternoon and pay a call
at the vicarage.

Mrs Asplin gathered what branches of russet leaves still remained in the garden and placed
them in bowls in the drawing-room, with a few precious chrysanthemums peeping out here and
there; laid out her very best tea-cloth and d'oyleys, and sent the girls upstairs to change
their well-worn school dresses for something fresher and smarter.

"And you, Peggy dear--you will put on your pretty red, of course!" she said, standing still,
with a bundle of branches in her arms, and looking with a kindly glance at the pale face, which
had somehow lost its sunny expression during the last two days.

Peggy hesitated and pursed up her lips.

"Why `of course,' Mrs Asplin?  I never change my dress until evening. Why need I do it to-day,
just because some strangers may call whom I have never seen before?"

It was the first time that the girl had objected to do what she was told, and Mrs Asplin was
both surprised and hurt by the tone in which she spoke--a good deal puzzled too, for Peggy
was by no means indifferent to pretty frocks, and as a rule fond of inventing excuses to wear
her best clothes.  Why, then, should she choose this afternoon of all others to refuse so simple
a request?  Just for a moment she felt tempted to make a sharp reply, and then tenderness for
the girl whose mother was so far-away took the place of the passing irritation, and she determined
to try a gentler method.

"There is not the slightest necessity, dear," she said quietly.  "I asked only because the
red dress suits you so well, and it would have been a pleasure to me to see you looking your
best.  But you are very nice and neat as you are.  You need not change unless you like."

She turned to leave the room as she finished speaking; but before she had reached the door
Peggy was by her side, holding out her hands to take possession of twigs and branches.

"Let me take them to the kitchen, please!  Let me help you!" she said quickly, and just for
a moment a little hand rested on her arm with a spasmodic pressure.  That was all; but it was
enough.  There was no need of a formal apology.  Mrs Asplin understood all the unspoken love
and penitence which was expressed in that simple action, and beamed with her brightest smile.

"Thank you, my lassie, please do!  I'm glad to avoid going near the kitchen again, for when
cook once gets hold of me I can never get away. She tells me the family history of all her
relatives, and indeed it's very depressing, it is," (with a relapse into her merry Irish accent),
"for they are subject to the most terrible afflictions!  I've had one dose of it to-day, and
I don't want another!"

Peggy laughed, and carried off her bundle, lingered in the kitchen just long enough to remind
the cook that "apple charlotte served with cream" was a seasonable pudding at the fall of the
year, and then went upstairs to put on the red dress, and relieve her feelings by making grimaces
at herself in the glass as she fastened the buttons.

At four o'clock the patter of horses' feet came from below, doors opened and shut, and there
was a sound of voices in the hall.  The visitors had arrived!

Peggy pressed her lips together, and bent doggedly over her writing. She had not progressed
with her work as well as she had hoped during Rob's absence, for her thoughts had been running
on other subjects, and she had made mistake after mistake.  She must try to finish one batch
at least, to show him on his return.  Unless she was especially sent for, she would not go
downstairs; but before ten minutes had passed, Mellicent was tapping at the door and whispering
eager sentences through the keyhole.

"Peggy, quick!  They've come!  Rosalind's here!  You're to come down! Quick!  Hurry up!"

"All right, my dear, keep calm!  You will have a fit if you excite yourself like this!" said
Peggy coolly.

The summons had come, and could not be disregarded, and on the whole she was not sorry.  The
meeting was bound to take place sooner or later, and, in spite of her affectation of indifference,
she was really consumed with curiosity to know what Rosalind was like.  She had no intention
of hurrying, however, but lingered over the arrangement of her papers until Mellicent had trotted
downstairs again, and the coast was clear.  Then she sauntered after her with leisurely dignity,
opened the drawing-room door, and gave a swift glance round.

Lady Darcy sat talking to Mrs Asplin a few yards away, in such a position that she faced the
doorway.  She looked up as Peggy entered, and swept her eyes curiously over the girl's figure.
She looked older than she had done from across the church the day before, and her face had
a bored expression, but, if possible, she was even more elegant in her attire.  It seemed quite
extraordinary to see such a fine lady sitting on that well-worn sofa, instead of the sober
figure of the vicar's wife.

Peggy flashed a look from one to the other--from the silk dress to the serge, from the beautiful
weary face to the cheery loving smile--and came to the conclusion that, for some mysterious
reason, Mrs Asplin was a happier woman than the wife of the great Lord Darcy.

The two ladies stopped talking and looked expectantly towards her.

"Come in, dear!  This is our new pupil, Lady Darcy, for whom you were asking.  You have heard
of her--"

"From Robert.  Oh yes, frequently!  I was especially anxious to see Robert's little friend.
How do you do, dear?  Let me see!  What is your funny little name?  Molly--Dolly--something
like that, I think--I forget for the moment?"

"Mariquita Saville!" quoth Peggy grandiloquently.  She was consumed with regret that she had
no second name to add to the number of syllables, but she did her best with those she possessed,
rolling them out in her very best manner and with a stately condescension which made Lady Darcy
smile for the first time since she entered the room.

"Oh-h!"  The lips parted to show a gleam of regular white teeth. "That's it, is it?  Well,
I am very pleased to make your acquaintance, Mariquita.  I hope we shall see a great deal of
you while we are here. You must go and make friends with Rosalind--my daughter.  She is longing
to know you."

"Yes, go and make friends with Rosalind, Peggy dear!  She was asking for you," said Mrs Asplin
kindly; and as the girl walked away the two ladies exchanged smiling glances.

"Amusing!  Such grand little manners!  Evidently a character."

"Oh, quite!  Peggy is nothing if not original.  She is a dear, good girl, but quite too funny
in her ways.  She is really the incarnation of mischief, and keeps me on tenter-hooks from
morning until night, but from her manner you would think she was a model of propriety.  Nothing
delights her so much as to get hold of a new word or a high-sounding phrase."

"But what a relief to have someone out of the ordinary run!  There are so many bores in the
world, it is quite refreshing to meet with a little originality.  Dear Mrs Asplin, you really
must tell me how you manage to look so happy and cheerful in this dead-alive place?  I am desolate
at the idea of staying here all winter.  What in the world do you find to do?"

Mrs Asplin laughed.

"Indeed, that's not the trouble at all; the question is how to find time to get through the
day's duties!  It's a rush from morning till night, and when evening comes I am delighted to
settle down in an easy-chair with a nice book to read.  One has no chance of feeling dull in
a house full of young people."

"Ah, you are so good and clever, you get through so much.  I want to ask your help in half
a dozen ways.  If we are to settle down here for some months, there are so many arrangements
to make.  Now tell me, what would you do in this case?"  The two ladies settled down to a discussion
on domestic matters, while Peggy crossed the room to the corner where Rosalind Darcy sat in
state, holding her court with Esther and Mellicent as attendant slaves.  She wore the same
grey dress in which she had appeared in church the day before, but the jacket was thrown open,
and displayed a distractingly dainty blouse, all pink chiffon, and frills, and ruffles of lace.
Her gloves lay in her lap, and the celebrated diamond ring flashed in the firelight as she
held out her hand to meet Peggy's.

"How do you do?  So glad to see you!  I've heard of you often.  You are the little girl who
is my bwothar's fwiend."  She pronounced the letter "r" as if it had been "w," and the "er"
in brother as if it had been "ah," and spoke with a languid society drawl more befitting a
woman of thirty than a schoolgirl of fifteen.

Peggy stood motionless and looked her over, from the crown of her hat to the tip of the little
trim shoe, with an expression of icy displeasure.

"Oh dear me, no," she said quietly, "you mistake the situation.  You put it the wrong way about.
Your brother is the big boy whom I have allowed to become a friend of mine!"

Esther and Mellicent gasped with amazement, while Rosalind gave a trill of laughter, and threw
up her pretty white hands.

"She's wexed!" she cried.  "She's wexed, because I called her little! I'm wewwy sowwy, but
I weally can't help it, don't you know.  It's the twuth!  You are a whole head smaller than
I am."  She threw back her chin, and looked over Peggy's head with a smile of triumph.  "There,
look at that, and I'm not a year older.  I call you wewwy small indeed for your age."

"I'm thankful to hear it!  I admire small women," said Peggy promptly, seating herself on a
corner of the window-seat, and staring critically at the tall figure of the visitor.  She would
have been delighted if she could have persuaded herself that her height was awkward and ungainly,
but such an effort was beyond imagination.  Rosalind was startlingly and wonderfully pretty;
she had never seen anyone in real life who was in the least like her.  Her eyes were a deep,
dark blue, with curling dark lashes, her face was a delicate oval, and the pink and white colouring,
and flowing golden locks, gave her the appearance of a princess in a fairy tale rather than
an ordinary flesh-and-blood maiden.  Peggy looked from her to Mellicent, who was considered
quite a beauty among her companions, and, oh dear me! how plain, and fat, and prosaic she appeared
when viewed side by side with this radiant vision!  Esther stood the comparison better, for,
though her long face had no pretensions to beauty, it was thoughtful and interesting in expression.
There was no question which was most charming to look at; but if it had come to choice of a
companion, an intelligent observer would certainly have decided in favour of the vicar's daughter.
Esther's face was particularly grave at this moment, and her eyes met Peggy's with a reproachful
glance.  What was the matter with the girl this afternoon? Why did she take up everything that
Rosalind said in that hasty, cantankerous manner?  Here was an annoying thing--to have just
given an enthusiastic account of the brightness and amicability of a new companion, and then
to have that companion come into the room only to make snappish remarks, and look as cross
and ill-natured as a bear!  She turned in an apologetic fashion to Rosalind, and tried to resume
the conversation at the point where it had been interrupted by Peggy's entrance.

"And I was saying, we have ever so many new things to show you-- presents, you know, and things
of that kind.  The last is the nicest of all: a really good big camera with which we can take
proper photographs. Mrs Saville--Peggy's mother--gave it to us before she left.  It was a present
to the schoolroom, so it belongs equally to us all, and we have such fun with it.  We are beginning
to do some good things now, but at first they were too funny for anything.  There is one of
father where his boots are twice as large as his head, and another of mother where her face
has run, and is about a yard long, and yet it is so like her! We laughed till we cried over
it, and father has locked it away in his desk.  He says he will keep it to look at when he
is low-spirited."

Rosalind gave a shrug to her shapely shoulders.

"It would not cheer me up to see a cawicature of myself!  I don't think I shall sit to you
for my portrait, if that is the sort of thing you do, but you shall show me all your failures.
It will amuse me.  You will have to come up and see me vewwy often this winter, for I shall
be so dull.  We have been abroad for the last four years, and England seems so dark and dweawy.
Last winter we were at Cairo.  We lived in a big hotel, and there was something going on almost
every night.  I was not out, of course, but I was allowed to go into the room for an hour after
dinner, and to dance with the gentlemen in mother's set.  And we went up the Nile in a steamer,
and dwove about every afternoon, paying calls, and shopping in the bazaars.  It never rains
in Cairo, and the sun is always shining.  It seems so wonderful!  Just like a place in a fairy
tale."  She looked at Peggy as she spoke, and that young person smiled with an air of elegant
condescension.

"It would do so to you.  Naturally it would.  When one has been born in the East, and lived
there the greater part of one's life, it seems natural enough, but the trippers from England
who just come out for a few months' visit are always astonished.  It used to amuse us so much
to hear their remarks!"

Rosalind stared, and flushed with displeasure.  She was accustomed to have her remarks treated
with respect, and the tone of superiority was a new and unpleasing experience.

"You were born in the East?"

"Certainly I was!"

"Where, may I ask?"

"In India--in Calcutta, where my father's regiment was stationed."

"You lived there till you were quite big?  You can remember all about it?"

"All I want to remember.  There was a great deal that I choose to forget.  I don't care for
India.  England is more congenial to my feelings."

"And can you speak the language?  Did you learn Hindostanee while you were there?"

"Naturally.  Of course I did."

A gasp of amazement came from the two girls in the window, for a knowledge of Hindostanee had
never been included in the list of Peggy's accomplishments, and she was not accustomed to hide
her light under a bushel.  They gazed at her with widened eyes, and Rosalind scented scepticism
in the air, and cried quickly--

"Say something, then.  If you can speak, say something now, and let us hear you."

"Pardon me!" said Peggy, simpering.  "As a matter of fact, I was sent home because I was learning
to speak too well.  The language of the natives is not considered suitable for English children
of tender age. I must ask you to be so kind as to excuse me.  I should be sorry to shock your
sensibilities."

Rosalind drew her brows together and stared steadily in the speaker's face.  Like many beautiful
people, she was not over-gifted with a sense of humour, and therefore Peggy's grandiose manner
and high-sounding words failed to amuse her as they did most strangers.  She felt only annoyed
and puzzled, dimly conscious that she was being laughed at, and that this girl with the small
face and the peaked eyebrows was trying to patronise her--Rosalind Darcy--instead of following
the vicar's daughters in adoring her from a respectful distance, as of course it was her duty
to do.  She had been anxious to meet the Peggy Saville of whom her brother had spoken so enthusiastically,
for it was a new thing to hear Rob praise a girl, but it was evident that Peggy on her side
was by no means eager to make her acquaintance.  It was an extraordinary discovery, and most
disconcerting to the feelings of one who was accustomed to be treated as a person of supreme
importance.  Rosalind could hardly speak for mortification, and it was an immense relief when
the door opened, and Max and Oswald hurried forward to greet her.  Then indeed she was in her
element, beaming with smiles, and indulging a dozen pretty little tricks of manner for the
benefit of their admiring eyes.  Max took possession of the chair by her side, his face lighted
up with pleasure and admiration.  He was too thoroughly natural and healthy a lad to be much
troubled with sentiment, but ever since one winter morning five years before, when Rosalind
had first appeared in the little country church, she had been his ideal of all that was womanly
and beautiful.  At every meeting he discovered fresh charms, and to-day was no exception to
the rule.  She was taller, fairer, more elegant.  In some mysterious manner she seemed to have
grown older than he, so that, though he was in reality three years her senior, he was still
a boy, while she was almost a young lady.

Mrs Asplin looked across the room, and a little anxious furrow showed in her forehead.  Maxwell's
admiration for Rosalind was already an old story, and as she saw his eager face and sparkling
eyes, a pang of fear came into his mother's heart.  If the Darcys were constantly coming down
to the Larches, it was only natural to suppose that this admiration would increase, and it
would never do for Max to fall in love with Rosalind!  The vicar's son would be no match for
Lord Darcy's daughter; it would only mean a heartache for the poor lad, a clouded horizon just
when life should be the brightest.  For a moment a prevision of trouble filled her heart, then
she waved it away in her cheery, hopeful fashion--

"Why, what a goose I am!  They are only children.  Time enough to worry my head about love
affairs in half a dozen years to come.  The lad would be a Stoic if he didn't admire her. 
I don't see how he could help it!"

"Rosalind is lovelier than ever, Lady Darcy, if that is possible!" she said aloud, and her
companion's face brightened with pleasure.

"Oh, do you think so?" she cried eagerly.  "I am so glad to hear it, for this growing stage
is so trying.  I was afraid she might outgrow her strength and lose her complexion, but so
far I don't think it has suffered.  I am very careful of her diet, and my maid understands
all the new skin treatments.  So much depends on a girl's complexion.  I notice your youngest
daughter has a very good colour.  May I ask what you use?"

"Soap and water, fresh air, good plain food,--those are the only cosmetics we use in this house,"
said Mrs Asplin, laughing outright at the idea of Mellicent's healthy bloom being the result
of "skin treatment."  "I am afraid I have too much to do looking after the necessities of life
for my girls, Lady Darcy, to worry myself about their complexions."

"Oh yes.  Well, I'm sure they both look charming; but Rosalind will go much into society, and
of course,"--She checked herself before the sentence was finished; but Mrs Asplin was quick
enough to understand the imputation that the complexions of a vicar's daughters were but of
small account, but that it was a very different matter when the Honourable Rosalind Darcy was
concerned.  She understood, but she was neither hurt nor annoyed by the inferences, only a
little sad and very, very pitiful.  She knew the story of the speaker's life, and the reason
why she looked forward to Rosalind's entrance into society with such ambition.  Lady Darcy
had been the daughter of poor but well-born parents, and had married the widower, Lord Darcy,
not because she loved him or had any motherly feeling for his two orphan boys, but simply and
solely for a title and establishment, and a purse full of money.  Given these, she had fondly
imagined that she was going to be perfectly happy. No more screwing and scraping to keep up
appearances; no more living in dulness and obscurity; she would be Lady Darcy, the beautiful
young wife of a famous man.  So, with no thought in her heart but for her own worldly advancement,
Beatrice Fairfax stood before God's altar and vowed to love, honour, and obey a man for whom
she had no scrap of affection, and whom she would have laughed to scorn if he had been poor
and friendless.  She married him, but the life which followed was not by any means all that
she had expected.  Lord Darcy had heavy money losses, which obliged him to curtail expenses
almost immediately after his wedding; her own health broke down, and it was a knife in her
heart to know that her boy was only the third son, and that the two big, handsome lads at Eton
would inherit the lion's share of their father's property. Hector, the Lifeguardsman, and Oscar,
the Dragoon, were for ever running into debt and making fresh demands on her husband's purse.
She and her children had to suffer for their extravagances; while Robert, her only son, was
growing up a shy, awkward lad, who hated society, and asked nothing better than to be left
in the country alone with his frogs and his beetles.  Ambition after ambition had failed her,
until now all her hopes were centred in Rosalind, the beautiful daughter, in whom she saw a
reproduction of herself in the days of her girlhood.  She had had a dull and obscure youth;
Rosalind should be the belle of society.  Her own marriage had been a disappointment; Rosalind
should make a brilliant alliance.  She had failed to gain the prize for which she had worked;
she would live again in Rosalind's triumphs, and in them find fullest satisfaction.

So Lady Darcy gloated over every detail of her daughter's beauty, and thought day and night
of her hair, her complexion, her figure, striving still to satisfy her poor tired soul with
promises of future success, and never dreaming for a moment that the prize which seemed to
elude her grasp had been gained long ago by the vicar's wife, with her old-fashioned dress
and work-worn hands.  But Mrs Asplin knew, and thanked God in her heart for the sweetness and
peace of her dear, shabby home; for the husband who loved her, and the children whom they were
training to be good servants for Him in the world Yes, and for that other child too, who had
been taken away at the very dawn of his manhood, and who, they believed, was doing still better
work in the unseen world.

Until Lady Darcy discovered that the only true happiness rose from something deeper than worldly
success, there was nothing in store for her but fresh disappointments and heart-hunger; while
as for Rosalind, the unfortunate child of such a mother--Mrs Asplin looked at the girl as she
sat leaning back in her chair, craning her throat, and showing off all her little airs and
graces for the benefit of the two admiring schoolboys, gratified vanity and self-love showing
on every line of her face.

"It seems almost cruel to say so," she sighed to herself, "but it would be the best thing that
could happen to the child if she were to lose some of her beauty before she grew up.  Such
a face as that is a terrible temptation to vanity."  But Mrs Asplin did not guess how soon
these unspoken words would come back to her memory, or what bitter cause she would have to
regret their fulfilment.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

A PINK LUNCHEON.

For the next week conversation was more strictly centred on Rosalind than ever, and the gloomy
expression deepened on Peggy's face.  She was, in truth, working too hard for her strength,
for, as each day passed, the necessity of hurrying on with the calendar became more apparent;
and as Robert was no longer master of his own time, she was obliged to come to his aid in writing
out the selected quotations.

At every spare moment of the day she was locked in her room, scribbling away for dear life
or searching for appropriate extracts, and, as a consequence, her brain refused to rest when
she wished it to do so.  She tossed wakefully on her pillow, and was often most inclined for
sleep when six o'clock struck, and she dragged herself up, a white-cheeked, weary little mortal,
to sit blinking over the fire, wishing feebly that it was time to go to bed again, instead
of getting up to face the long, long day.

Robert was not more observant than most boys of his age, and Peggy would have worked herself
to death before she had complained to him.  She was proud to feel that he depended on her more
than ever, that without her help he could not possibly have finished his task, while his words
of gratitude helped to comfort a heart which was feeling sore and empty.

In truth, these last few weeks had been harder for Peggy than those immediately following her
mother's departure.  Then each one in the house had vied with the other in trying to comfort
her, whereas now, without any intention of unkindness, her companions often appeared to be
neglectful.

When Rosalind was present Esther hung on one arm and Mellicent on the other, without so much
as a glance over the shoulder to see if Peggy were following.  Instead of a constant "Peggy,
what would you like?"

"What does Peggy say?" her opinion was never even asked, while Rosalind's lightest word was
treated as law.

It would have been hard for any girl under the circumstances, but it was doubly hard when that
girl was so dependent on her friends, and so sensitive and reserved in disposition as Peggy
Saville.  She would not deign to complain or to ask for signs of affection which were not voluntarily
given, but her merry ways disappeared, and she became so silent and subdued that she was hardly
recognisable as the audacious Peggy of a few weeks earlier.

"Peggy's so grumpy," Mellicent complained to her mother.  "She never laughs now, nor makes
jokes, nor flies about as she used to do!  She's just as glum and mum as can be, and she never
sits with us!  She is always in her bedroom with the door locked, so that we can't get in!
She's there now!  I think she might stay with us sometimes!  It's mean, always running away!"

Mrs Asplin drew her brows together and looked worried.  She had not been satisfied about Peggy
lately, and this news did not tend to reassure her.  Her kind heart could not endure that anyone
beneath her roof should be ill or unhappy, and the girl had looked both during the last few
days.  She went upstairs at once and tapped at the door, when Peggy's voice was raised in impatient
answer.

"I can't come!  Go away!  I'm engaged!"

"But I want to speak to you, dear!  Please let me in!" she replied in her clear, pleasant tones;
whereupon there was a hasty scamper inside, and the door was thrown open.

"Oh-h!  I didn't know it was you; I thought it was one of the girls. I'm sorry I kept you waiting."

Mrs Asplin gave a glance around.  The gas-fire was lit, but the chair beside it stood stiffly
in the corner, and the cushion was uncrushed. Evidently, the girl had not been sitting there.
The work-basket was in its accustomed place, and there were no cottons or silks lying about--
Peggy had not been sewing at Christmas presents, as she had half hoped to find her.  A towel
was thrown over the writing-table, and a piece of blotting-paper lay on the floor.  A chair
was pushed to one side, as if it had been lately used.  That looked as if she had been writing
letters.

"Peggy dear, what are you doing all by yourself in this chilly room?"

"I'm busy, Mrs Asplin.  I lit the fire as soon as I came in."

"But a room does not get warm in five minutes.  I don't want you to catch cold and be laid
up with a sore throat.  Can't you bring your writing downstairs and do it beside the others?"

"I would rather not.  I can get on so much better by myself."

"Are you writing to India--to your mother?"

"N-no, not just now."

"Then really, dear, you must come downstairs!  This won't do!  Your mother wished you to have
a fire in your room, so that you might be able to sit here when you wanted to be alone, but
she never meant you to make it a habit, or to spend all your spare time alone.  It isn't healthy
to use a room night and day, and to burn so much gas, and it isn't sociable, Peggy dear.  Mellicent
has just been complaining that you are hardly ever with them nowadays.  Come along, like a
good girl; put the writing away and amuse yourself downstairs.  You have done enough work for
one day.  You don't do me credit with those white cheeks."

Peggy stood with her eyes fixed on the carpet without uttering a word. It would have been the
easiest thing in the world to say, "Oh, do let me stay upstairs as much as I like for a day
or two longer.  I have a piece of work on hand which I am anxious to finish.  It is a secret,
but I hope to tell you all about it soon, and I am sure you will be pleased." If she had done
so, she knew perfectly well how hearty and pleasant would have been Mrs Asplin's consent; but
there are some states of mind in which it is a positive pleasure to be a martyr, and to feel
oneself misunderstood, and this was just the mood in which Peggy found herself at present.
She heard Mrs Asplin sigh, as if with anxiety and disappointment, as she left the room, and
shrugged her shoulders in wilful indifference.

"She thinks I like sitting shivering here!  I slave, and slave, from morning till night, and
then people think I am sulky!  I am not working for myself.  I don't want the wretched old
ten pounds; I could have ten pounds to-morrow if I needed it.  Mother said I could.  I am working
to help Rob, and now I shall have to sit up later, and get up earlier than ever, as I mayn't
work during the day.  Mellicent said I was never with them, did she!  I don't see that it matters
whether I am there or not! They don't want me; nobody wants me, now that Rosalind has come!
I hate Rosalind--nasty, smirking, conceited thing!" and Peggy jerked the towel off the writing-table
and flicked it violently to and fro in the air, just as a little relief to her overcharged
feelings.

She was crossing the hall with unwilling steps when the postman's knock sounded at the door,
and three letters in long, narrow envelopes fell to the ground.  Each envelope was of a pale
pink tint, with a crest and monogram in white relief; one was addressed to the Misses Asplin,
another to Oswald Elliston, and a third to Miss Mariquita Saville.

"Invitations!" cried Peggy, with a caper of delight.  "Invitations!  How scrumptious!"  Her
face clouded for a moment as the sight of the letters "R.D." suggested the sender of the letters;
but the natural girlish delight in an unexpected festivity was stronger even than her prejudices,
and it was the old, bright Peggy who bounced into the schoolroom holding up the three letters,
and crying gleefully, "Quis, Quis, something nice for somebody!  An invitation!"

"Ego, Ego!" came the eager replies, and the envelopes were seized and torn open in breathless
haste.

"From Rosalind!  Oh, how funny!  `Requests the pleasure--company--to a pink luncheon.'  What
in the world is a `pink luncheon'?--`on Tuesday next, the 20th inst.'"

"A p-p-pink luncheon?  How wewwy stwange!" echoed Mellicent, who had been suddenly affected
with an incapacity to pronounce the letter "r" since the arrival of Rosalind Darcy on the scene--a
peculiarity which happened regularly every autumn, and passed off again with the advent of
spring.  "How can a luncheon possibly be pink?"

"That's more than I can tell you, my dear!  Ask Rob.  What does it mean, Rob?" asked Peggy
curiously; and Robert scowled, and shook back his shock of hair.

"Some American fad, I believe.  The idea is to have everything of one colour--flowers, drapery,
and food, china--everything that is on the table.  It's a fag and an awful handicap, for you
can't have half the things you want.  But let us be modern or die--that's the motto nowadays.
Mother is always trying to get hold of new-fangled notions."

"`Peggy Saville requests the pleasure of Jane Smith's company to a magenta supper.'--`Peggy
Saville requests the pleasure of Mr Jones's company to a purple tea.'  It's a splendid idea!
I like it immensely," said Peggy, pursing her lips, and staring in the fire in meditative fashion.
"Pink--pink--what can we eat that is pink?  P-prawns, p-pickles, p-p-pomegranates, P-aysandu
tongues (you would call those pink, wouldn't you--pinky red?)  Humph!  I don't think it sounds
very nice.  Perhaps they dye the things with cochineal.  I think I shall have a sensible brown
and green meal before I go, and then I can nibble elegantly at the pinkies.  Would it be considered
a delicate mark of attention if I wore a pink frock?"

"Certainly it would.  Wear that nice one that you put on in the evenings.  Rosalind will be
in pink from head to foot, you may depend on it," said Robert confidently; whereupon Mellicent
rushed headlong from the room to find her mother, and plead eagerly that summer crepon dresses
of the desired tint should be brought forth from their hiding-place and freshened up for the
occasion.  To accede to this request meant an extra call upon time already fully occupied,
but mothers have a way of not grudging trouble where their children are concerned.  Mrs Asplin
said, "Yes, darling, of course I will!" and set to work with such goodwill that all three girls
sported pink dresses beneath their ulsters when they set off to partake of the mysterious luncheon,
a few days later.

Rosalind came to the bedroom to receive them, and looked on from an arm-chair, while Lady Darcy's
maid helped the visitors to take off their wraps.  She herself looked like a rose in her dainty
pink draperies, and Peggy had an impression that she was not altogether pleased to see that
her guests were as appropriately dressed as herself.  She eyed them up and down, and made remarks
to the maid in that fluent French of hers which was so unintelligible to the schoolgirls' ears.
The maid smirked and pursed up her lips, and then, meeting Peggy's steady gaze, dropped her
eyes in confusion.  Peggy knew, as well as if she had understood every word, that the remarks
exchanged between mistress and maid had been of a depreciatory nature, not as concerned her
own attire--that was as perfect in its way as Rosalind's own--but with reference to the home-made
dresses of the vicar's daughters, which seemed to have suddenly become clumsy and shapeless
when viewed in the mirrors of this elegant bedroom.  She was in arms at once on her friends'
behalf, and when Peggy's dignity was hurt she was a formidable person to tackle.  In this instance
she fixed her eyes first on the maid, and then on Rosalind herself with a steady, disapproving
stare which was not a little disconcerting.

"I am sorry," she said, "but we really don't know French well enough to follow your conversation!
You were talking about us, I think.  Perhaps you would be kind enough to repeat your remarks
in English?"

"Oh-h, it doesn't matter!  It was nothing at all important!"  Rosalind flushed, and had the
grace to look a trifle ashamed of her own ill-breeding, but she did not by any means appreciate
the reproof.  The girls had not been ten minutes in the house, and already that aggravating
Peggy Saville had succeeded in making her feel humiliated and uncomfortable.  The same thing
happened whenever they met.  The respect and awe and adoring admiration which she was accustomed
to receive from other girls of her own age seemed altogether wanting in Peggy's case; and yet,
strange to say, the very fact that she refused to fall down and worship invested Peggy with
a peculiar importance in Rosalind's eyes.  She longed to overcome her prejudices and add her
name to the list of her adorers, and to this end she considered her tastes in a way which would
never have occurred to her in connection with Mrs Asplin's daughters.  In planning the pink
luncheon Peggy had been continually in her mind, and it is doubtful whether she would have
taken the trouble to arrange so difficult an entertainment had not the party from the vicarage
included that important personage, Miss Mariquita Saville.

From the bedroom the girls adjourned to the morning-room, where Lady Darcy sat waiting; but
almost as soon as they had exchanged greetings, the gong sounded to announce luncheon, and
they walked across the hall aglow with expectation.

The table looked exquisite, and the guests stood still in the doorway and gasped with admiration.
The weather outside was grey and murky, but tall standard lamps were placed here and there,
and the light which streamed from beneath the pink silk shades gave an air of warmth and comfort
to the room.  Down the centre of the table lay a slip of looking-glass, on which graceful long-necked
swans seemed to float to and fro, while troughs filled with soft pink blossoms formed a bordering.
Garlands of pink flowers fell from the chandelier and were attached to the silver candelabra,
in which pink candles burned with clear and steady flare.  Glass, china, ornaments, were all
of the same dainty colour, and beside each plate was a dainty little buttonhole nosegay, with
a coral-headed pin, all ready to be attached to the dress or coat of the owner.

"It's--it's beautiful!" cried Mellicent ecstatically; while Peggy's beauty-loving eye turned
from one detail to another with delighted approbation.  "Really," she said to herself in astonishment,
"I couldn't have done it better myself!  It's quite admirable!" and as Rosalind's face peered
inquiringly at her beneath the canopy of flowers, she nodded her head, and smiled generous
approval.

"Beautiful!  Charming!  I congratulate you!  Did you design it and arrange everything yourself?"

"Mother and I made it up between us.  We didn't do the actual work, but we told the servants
what to do, and saw that it was all right.  The flowers and bonbons are easy enough to manage;
it's the things to eat that are the greatest trouble."

"It seems to be too horribly prosaic to eat anything at such a table, except crumpled rose-leaves,
like the princess in the fairy tale," said Peggy gushingly; but at this Mellicent gave an exclamation
of dismay, and the three big lads turned their eyes simultaneously towards the soup tureen,
as if anxious to assure themselves that they were not to be put off with such ethereal rations.

The soup was pink.  "Tomato!" murmured Peggy to herself, as she raised the first creamy spoonful
to her lips.  The fish was covered with thick pink sauce; tiny little cutlets lurked behind
ruffles of pink paper; pink baskets held chicken souffles; moulds of pink cream and whipped-up
syllabubs were handed round in turns, and looked so tempting that Mellicent helped herself
at once, and nearly shed tears of mortification on finding that they were followed by distracting
pink ices, which were carried away again before she could possibly finish what was on her plate.
Then came dessert-plates and finger-glasses, in which crystallised rose-leaves floated in the
scented water, as if in fulfilment of Peggy's suggestion of an hour before, and the young people
sat in great contentment, eating rosy apples, bananas pared and dipped in pink sugar, or helping
themselves to the delicious bonbons which were strewed about the table.

While they were thus occupied the door opened, and Lord Darcy came into the room.  He had not
appeared before, and he shook hands with the visitors in turn, and then stood at the head of
the table looking about him with a slow, kindly smile.  Peggy watched him from her seat, and
thought what a nice face he had, and wondered at the indifferent manner in which he was received
by his wife and daughter.  Lady Darcy leant back in her chair and played with her fruit, the
sleeves of her pink silk tea-gown falling back from her white arms.  Rosalind whispered to
Max, and neither of them troubled to cast so much as a glance of welcome at the new-comer.
Peggy thought of her own father, the gallant soldier out in India, of the joy and pride with
which his comings and goings were watched; of Mr Asplin in the vicarage, with his wife running
to meet him, and Mellicent resting her curly bead on his shoulder; and the figure of the old
lord standing unnoticed at the head of his own table assumed a pathetic interest.  It seemed,
however, as if Lord Darcy were accustomed to be overlooked, for he showed no signs of annoyance;
on the contrary, his face brightened, and he looked at the pretty scene with sparkling eyes.
The room was full of a soft rosy glow, the shimmer of silver and crystal was reflected in the
sheet of mirror, and beneath the garlands of flowers the young faces of the guests glowed with
pleasure and excitement.  He looked from one to the other--handsome Max, dandy Oswald, Robert
with his look of strength and decision; then to the girls--Esther, gravely smiling; wide-eyed
Mellicent; Peggy, with her eloquent, sparkling eyes; Rosalind, a queen of beauty among them
all; finally to the head of the table, where sat his wife.

"I must congratulate you, dear," he said heartily.  "It is the prettiest sight I have seen
for a long time.  You have arranged admirably, but that's no new thing; you always do.  I don't
know where you get your ideas.  These wreaths--eh?  I've never seen anything like them before.
What made you think of fastening them up there?"

"I have had them like that several times before, but you never notice a thing until its novelty
is over, and I am tired to death of seeing it," said his wife, with a frown and an impatient
curve of the lip, as if she had received a rebuke instead of a compliment.

Peggy stared at her plate, felt Robert shuffle on his chair by her side, and realised that
he was as embarrassed and unhappy as herself.  The beautiful room with its luxurious appointments
seemed to have suddenly become oppressive and cheerless, for in it was the spirit of discontent
and discord between those who should have been most in harmony.  Esther was shocked, Mellicent
frightened, the boys looked awkward and uncomfortable.  No one ventured to break the silence,
and there was quite a long pause before Lady Darcy spoke again in quick, irritable tones.

"Have you arranged to get away with me on Thursday, as I asked you?"

"My dear, I cannot.  I explained before.  I am extremely sorry, but I have made appointments
which I cannot break.  I could take you next week if you would wait."

"I can't wait.  I told you I had to go to the dentist's.  Do you wish me to linger on in agony
for another week?  And I have written to Mrs Bouverie that I will be at her `At Home' on Saturday.
My appointments are, at least, as binding as yours.  It isn't often that I ask you to take
me anywhere, but when it is a matter of health I do think you might show a little consideration."

Lord Darcy drew his brows together and bit his moustache.  Peggy recalled Robert's description
of the "governor looking wretched" when he found himself compelled to refuse a favour, and
did not wonder that the lad was ready to deny himself a pleasure rather than see that expression
on his father's face.  The twinkling light had died out of his eyes, and he looked old and
sad and haggard, far more in need of physical remedies than his wife, whose "agony" had been
so well concealed during the last two hours as to give her the appearance of a person in very
comfortable health.  Rosalind alone looked absolutely unruffled, and lay back in her chair
nibbling at her bonbon, as though such scenes were of too frequent occurrence between her parents
to be deserving of attention.

"If you have made up your mind to go to-morrow, and cannot go alone, you must take Robert with
you, Beatrice, for I cannot leave.  It is only for four days, and Mr Asplin will no doubt excuse
him, if you write and explain the circumstances."

Lord Darcy left the room, and Robert and Peggy exchanged agonised glances.  Go away for nearly
a week, when before two days were over the calendar must be sent to London, and there still
remained real hard work before it was finished!  Peggy sat dazed and miserable, seeing the
painful effort of the last month brought to naught, Robert's ambition defeated, and her own
help of no avail.  That one glance had shown the lad's face flushed with emotion; but when
his mother spoke to him in fretful tones, bidding him be ready next morning when she should
call in the carriage on her way to the station, he answered at once with polite acquiescence--

"Very well, mater, I won't keep you waiting.  I shall be ready by half-past ten if you want me."

CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.

Lady Darcy left the young people by themselves after luncheon, and, as was only natural, conversation
at once turned on the proposed visit to London.  Peggy was too much perturbed to speak, but
Mellicent put the very inquiry which she most wished answered, being never troubled with bashfulness
in asking questions.

"Has your mother's tooth been hurting her very much, Rosalind?"

"Tooth! what tooth?  Oh, I think she did have a little twinge one night; but it's not the dentist
whom she is really going to see.  That's only an excuse.  She really wants to go to some parties,"
said Rosalind lightly; whereat her brother scowled at her under heavy brows.

"What business have you to say that?  What can you know about it, pray? If mother says she
is in pain, it is not for you to contradict, and make up your own explanations.  Leave her
to manage her own affairs--"

He spoke rapidly, but Rosalind only shrugged her shoulders, and whispered something in Max's
ear, at which he smiled and nodded his head, evidently taking her part against her brother,
to Peggy's intense indignation.

No words were exchanged between the partners on the subject of the calendar until they were
once more at home; when Robert took advantage of the first quiet opportunity, and came up to
Peggy with a face of set determination.

"Mariquita!" he said, "I--am--not--going--to give in!  If you stick to me, we can still manage
to get the calendar off in time.  There are twenty more quotations to be found.  I'll sit up
to-night and fix them off, and go on writing as long as I can keep awake, but I can't take
a dozen books up to town with me, so I must leave it to you to finish up.  I'll mark the passages
I choose, write the full address on a piece of paper, and leave everything ready for you to
make up the parcel.  All you will have to do will be to write the remaining cards, and to see
that it is sent off on Friday.  Five o'clock will be time enough, but if you can get it off
in the morning, so much the better. You think you can manage as much as that?"

"Oh yes!  I'd do anything rather than give up now.  It would be too grudging.  I am not afraid
of a little more work."

"You have done more than your share already.  I am mad about it, but it can't be helped.  I
couldn't refuse to go with the mater, and I wouldn't if I could.  She is really not at all
strong, and does not like the life down here.  It will do her good to have a few days' change."

Peggy looked at him steadily.  She did not speak, but her eyes grew soft and shining, and there
was something at once so sweet, so kindly, and so gentle in her expression that Rob exclaimed
in surprise--

"I say, Peggy, you--you do look pretty!  I never saw you look like that before--what have you
been doing to yourself?"

"Doing!"  Peggy straightened herself at that, in offended dignity. "Doing, indeed!  What do
you mean?  Don't you think I am pretty as a rule?"

"Never thought about it," returned Robert carelessly.  "You are Peggy-- that's enough for me.
A nice state I should be in to-day if it were not for you!  You are the jolliest little brick
I ever met, and if I get this prize it will be far more your doing than my own."

Well, that was good hearing!  Peggy held her head high for the rest of that evening, and felt
as if nothing would have power to depress her for the future.  But, alas, when the pendulum
is at its highest it begins to swing downwards.  Peggy's heart sank as she watched Robert drive
away from the door the next morning, and it went on sinking more and more during the next twenty-four
hours, as she realised the responsibility which weighed upon her shoulders.  When she came
down to breakfast on Friday morning the calendar was finished and ready to be made up for the
post, but her head was splitting with pain as the result of the long hours' work stolen from
sleep, and a dead weight of depression had settled on her spirits.  It seemed of a sudden that
all this work and effort was waste of time; that the chances of being successful were infinitesimally
small; that even if it were gained, the prize was of little value; that if Robert's absence
for four days made such a difference in the life at the vicarage, it would become altogether
unbearable when he said good-bye at the beginning of the year and went up to Oxford; that she
was a desperately unfortunate little unit, thrust into the midst of a family which was complete
in itself, and had only a kindly toleration to offer to a stranger; that, in all probability,
there would shortly be a war in India, when her father would be killed, her mother die of a
broken heart, and Arthur be called out to join the ranks of the recruits.  She conjured up
a touching picture of herself, swathed in crape, bidding good-bye to her brother at the railway
station, and watching the scarlet coat disappear in the distance, as the train steamed away.
It was all most miserable and picturesque, and outside the fog gathered, and the rain poured
down in a fine, persistent drizzle.  It was one of those typical November days when it seems
as if the earth itself is in the blues, and that it becomes everyone living on its surface
to follow its example.

When afternoon came Peggy curled herself in an arm-chair in the corner of the study, and stared
gloomily at the fire.  It was four o'clock.  In another hour the postman would call for the
letters, and she would deliver the precious packet into his hands.  She had made it up in the
dinner-hour, with some faint idea of carrying it to the village; but she was tired, the rain
poured, and Rob had said that the afternoon post would do.  She had given up the idea of going
out, and taken a nap instead on the top of her bed.  And now it was four o'clock.  Mellicent
called out that she was dying for tea-time to come; it had seemed such a long, long day; they
really ought to have tea earlier on these dreary, murky afternoons.  "I want my tea!" she chanted,
in shrill, penetrating tones, and instantly the refrain was taken up by the other voices, and
repeated over and over again with ever-increasing volume, until the mistress of the house rushed
in to discover the reason of the clamour.

"Bless your hearts, you shall have it at once!" she cried.  "I'll ring and have it brought
in, and ransack my cupboards to see what treats I can give you.  Poor dears, it is dull for
you sitting indoors all day long.  We must think of some bright, exciting games for this evening."
No sooner said than done; she did not wait until Mary appeared, but bustled off to meet her,
to enlist the cook's sympathy, and put out the promised delicacies, and when the table was
set she returned to the room and seated herself, smilingly, in Esther's place.

"I am going to stay with you this afternoon," she said brightly.  "Draw up your chairs, dears,
and let us be jovial.  There is no credit in being happy when the sun is shining, as dear old
Mark Tapley would have said; but it will really be praiseworthy if we succeed in being festive
this afternoon.  Come, Peggy, dearie!"

Peggy turned her dreary little face and stared at the table.  From outside came the sound of
the opening and shutting of the door, of footsteps in the hall.  She glanced at the clock,
wondering if it could possibly be the postman already, found it was only ten minutes past four,
and dismissed the supposition with a sigh.  "I don't--think--I want--" she was beginning slowly,
when, of a sudden, there came a tremendous rat-tat-tat on the schoolroom door; the handle was
not turned, but burst open; a blast of chilly air blew into the room, and in the doorway stood
a tall, handsome youth, with square shoulders, a gracefully poised head, and Peggy Saville's
eave-like brows above his dancing eyes.

"Oh, what a surprise!" came the cry in loud laughing tones.  "How do you do, everybody?  Just
thought I would step in as I was passing, and have a cup of tea, don't you know."

"My boy!  My boy!  Oh, how good to see you!" cried Mrs Asplin rapturously.  Mellicent gurgled
with surprise, and Peggy stood up by her chair and stretched out both arms like a child to
its mother.

"Arthur!--oh--Arthur!" she gasped, and there was a pathos, a longing, an almost incredulous
rapture in her voice which made the tears start in Mrs Asplin's eyes, and brought a cloud of
anxiety over the new-comer's face.

"Why, Peg!" he cried.  "My little Peg!  Is something wrong, dear?  You look as melancholy as--"

"Peggy has not been like herself for the last few weeks.  I think she has had an attack of
homesickness and longing for her own people.  I'm so glad you've come.  You will do her more
good than a dozen tonics. Bless the boy; how big he is!  And how did you manage to get away,
dear, and how long can you stay?  Tell me all about it.  I am consumed with curiosity--"

"I can stay till Monday or Tuesday, if you can put me up; and I came away because I--I suppose
I am not quite up to the mark.  My head bothers me.  It aches, and I see black specks floating
before my eyes. The doctor advised me to knock off for a few days, and I thought I would rather
come here than anywhere."

"I should think so, indeed.  Of course we can put you up--proud and pleased to do so.  Well,
this is a pleasant surprise for a dull November day!  You couldn't have had a better one if
you had had a hundred wishes, could you, Peggy?  You won't feel melancholy any longer?"

"I'm just enraptured!  Saturday, Sunday, Monday--three whole days and two halves, as good as
four days--almost a week!  It's too delicious-- too utterly delicious to realise!"

Peggy drew deep sighs of happiness, and hung on to Arthur's arm in an abandonment of tenderness
which showed her in a new light to her companions.  She would not loosen her grasp for a moment,
and even when seated at the table kept her fingers tightly locked round his arm, as though
afraid that he might escape.

As for Arthur himself, he was in the wildest spirits.  He was as handsome a young soldier as
one could wish to see, and his likeness to Peggy seemed only to make him more attractive in
the eyes of the beholders.

"Hurrah!" he cried cheerily.  "Hurrah, for a good old vicarage tea! Scones? that's the style!
Mary made them, I hope, and put in lots of currants.  Raspberry jam!  I say, mater, do you
remember that solemn waitress you had, who told you that the jam was done again, and when you
exclaimed in horror, said, `Yes, 'um, it's not a bit of good buying raspberry jam.  They like
it!'  Ha, ha, ha!  I've often thought of that!  That looks uncommonly good cake you have over
there.  Thank you, I think I will!  Begin with cake, and work steadily back to bread and butter--that's
the style, isn't it, Peggums?  Esther, I looks towards you!  Mellicent, you are as thin as
ever, I see.  You should really do something for it.  There are regular hollows in your cheeks."

"Nasty, horrid thing!  You are always teasing!  How would you like it if you were struck fat
yourself?" cried Mellicent, aggrieved.  But, in spite of herself, her chubby cheeks dimpled
with smiles as Arthur rolled his eyes at her across the table, for there was something irresistibly
fascinating about this young fellow, and it was like old times to see him seated at the tea-table
and to listen to his merry rattling voice.

"The dominie must grant a general holiday to-morrow," he declared, "and we will do something
fine to celebrate the occasion.  We'll have out this wonderful camera in the morning and take
some groups.  You and I must be taken together, Peggy, to send out to the parents.  You promised
to send me copies of all the things you took, but you are as false in that respect as the whole
race of amateur photographers.  They are grand hands at promising, but they never, by any chance--Hallo!
What's that? My cup over?  Awfully sorry, mater, really!  I'll put a penny in the missionary-box.
Was it a clean cloth?"

"Oh, my dear boy, don't apologise!  I should not have felt that it was really you if you had
not knocked your cup over!  To see the table-cloth swimming with tea all round convinces me
that it is Arthur himself, and nobody else!  Tut, tut!  What does a table-cloth matter?"  And
Mrs Asplin beamed upon her favourite as if she were really rather delighted than otherwise
at his exploit.

It was a merry, not to say noisy, meal which followed.  Peggy's lost spirits had come back
with the first glimpse of Arthur's face; and her quips and cranks were so irresistibly droll
that three separate times over Mellicent choked over her tea, and had to be relieved with vigorous
pounding on the back, while even Esther shook with laughter, and the boys became positively
uproarious.

Then Mr Asplin came in, and Arthur was carefully concealed behind the window-curtains, while
he was asked whom he would most like to see if the choice were given him.  In provoking manner
he mentioned at once a brother in Australia, and, when informed that relatives were not on
the list, recollected an old college chum who was out in the Mauritius.

"Oh dear, what a stupid man!" cried his wife in despair.  "We don't mean the friends of your
youth, dear!  Think of the last few years and of your young friends!  Now, if you could choose,
whom would you--"

"Arthur Saville!" said the vicar promptly, upon which Arthur made a loophole between the curtains
and thrust his mischievous face through the gap, to the vicar's amazement and the uproarious
delight of the onlookers.  A dozen questions had to be asked and answered about studies, examinations,
and health, while Peggy sat listening, beaming with happiness and pride.

It came as quite a shock to all when the vicar announced that it was time to dress for dinner,
and Mrs Asplin looked at Peggy with an apologetic smile.

"We were all so charmed to see Arthur that I'm afraid we have been selfish and engrossed too
much of his attention.  You two will be longing for a cosy little chat to yourselves.  If you
run upstairs now, Peggy, and hurry through your dressing, there will be a little time before
dinner, and you could have this room to yourselves."

"Yes, run along, Peg!  It won't take me ten minutes to get into my clothes, and I'll be here
waiting for you!" cried Arthur eagerly.  And Peggy went flying two steps at a time upstairs
to her own room.

The gas was lit; the can of hot water stood in the basin, the towel neatly folded over the
top; the hands of the little red clock pointed to six o'clock, and the faint chime met her
ear as she entered.

Peggy stood still in the doorway, an icy chill crept through her veins, her hands grasped the
lintel, and her eyes grew wide and blank with horror.  There, on the writing-table lay a brown
paper parcel--the precious parcel which contained the calendar which had been the object of
such painful work and anxiety!

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

PEGGY IS LOST.

Arthur Saville waited in vain by the schoolroom fire, for his sister did not join him.  And
when he entered the dining-room in response to the summons of the gong, she had not yet made
her appearance.

Mrs Asplin looked at him with uplifted brows.

"Where is Peggy?"

"I don't know.  I haven't seen her since she went upstairs.  The little wretch can't have hurried
very much."

"She hasn't been with you, then!  Never mind, there is plenty of time to come.  She must be
making a special toilet for your benefit."

But when the first course was nearly over and the girl had not yet appeared, Mrs Asplin grew
impatient, and despatched the servant to hasten her movements.

"Just tell her that we have been at table for nearly ten minutes.  Ask if she will be long."

Mary left the room, was absent a short time, and came back with an extraordinary statement.

"Miss Peggy is not in her room, ma'am."

"Not in her room!  Then she must have come downstairs.  Perhaps she didn't hear the gong. 
Just look in the schoolroom, Mary, and in the other rooms too, and tell her to come at once."

Another few minutes passed, and back again came Mary, looking flushed and mysterious.

"I can't see Miss Peggy anywhere, ma'am.  She has not come downstairs."

"You have looked in the drawing-room--Mr Asplin's study?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Did you go upstairs again?"

"No, ma'am.  I had looked there before."

"Esther dear, you go!" cried Mrs Asplin quickly.  "Bring her down at once!  What in the world
is the child doing?  It's most extraordinary!"

"She's not given to playing games of hide-and-seek just at dinner-time, is she?" asked Arthur,
laughing.  "I am never surprised at anything Peggy does.  She has some little prank on hand,
depend upon it, and will turn up in good time.  It's her own fault if she misses her dinner."

"But it's so extraordinary!  To-night of all nights, when you have just arrived!  I wish the
child would come!" replied Mrs Asplin, craning her neck forward to listen to the cries of "Peggy!
Peggy!" which came from the upper storey.

The door stood open, and everyone ceased talking to follow Esther's footsteps to and fro, to
count the opening and shutting of doors--one, two, three, four, five--to look apprehensively
at each other as the messenger returned--alone!

"Mother, she is not there!  I've looked everywhere--in every corner--and she has not changed
her dress, nor washed, nor anything.  The room looks exactly as if she had never gone in; but
she did, for we all followed her upstairs.  I looked over the wardrobe, and all her dresses
are there, and the can of hot water is untouched, and the gas left full up."

"Oh dear, what can have happened?"  Mrs Asplin pushed back her chair and stood up, looking
anxious and puzzled.  "I cannot rest until she is found!  I must look myself!  Go on with dinner,
all of you; I won't be long.  Where can the child be hiding herself?"

"Don't worry, mater!" said Arthur kindly.  "It's very tiresome of Peggy to disappear at such
an inopportune moment, but no harm can have happened to her, you know.  It's impossible!  As
I said before, she has probably some wild prank in her head of which this is a part.  I'll
give her a lecture when I catch her for spoiling dinner like this, and such an uncommonly good
dinner too!"  And Arthur smiled in cheery fashion, and tried his best to keep up the failing
spirits of the company by chatting away while his hostess was out of the room, as if nothing
had happened which was the least unusual or alarming.

When Mrs Asplin returned, however, after a lengthened absence, there was a simultaneous rising
from the table to listen to her report.

"She is not in the house!  Jane began at the top and I began at the bottom, and we searched
every hole and corner.  I have looked in the very cupboards and wardrobes!  I even searched
the cistern-room, but she is not to be found.  I don't know what to do next.  It seems impossible
that she can have disappeared--yet where can she be?"

"Have you looked in the cloak-room to see if any of her outdoor things are missing?"

"I went in, but I never thought of looking at her clothes.  Outdoor? What on earth should take
the child out at this hour in the dark and rain?"

"I can't tell you that, dear, but we must think of every possibility. Esther, you know best
what Peggy had in the cloak-room--see if anything is missing.  Mellicent, run upstairs and
find if any hats or jackets have been taken from their places.  If she is not in the house,
she must have gone out.  It was most thoughtless and foolish to go without asking permission,
and at such an hour; but, as Arthur says, there is not much chance of any harm befalling her.
Try not to work yourself up into a state of anxiety, dear; we shall soon find your truant for
you.  Well, Esther, what is it?"

"Her mackintosh has gone, father, and her red tam-o'-shanter, and her snow-shoes.  Her peg
is next to mine, and there is nothing on it but her check golf cape."

"She has gone out, then!  What can it mean?--to-night of all nights, when she was so happy,
when Arthur had just arrived, when she promised to be downstairs in ten minutes--"

"It is most extraordinary!  It must have been something of great importance, one would say.
Does anyone know if Peggy had any special interest on hand at present?  Was there any gift
which she wished to buy?  It does not happen to be anyone's birthday to-morrow, does it? Yours,
Arthur, for instance?  No?  The birthday of a school-friend, then?  She might suddenly have
remembered such an occasion, and rushed out to post a letter--"

"But there is no post until to-morrow morning, so she would gain no time by doing that.  The
postman called at five o'clock, and the letters were on the hall-table waiting for him as usual.
I do not know of any work that she had on hand, but the girls have complained that she has
spent all her spare time in her room lately, and when I spoke to her about it she said she
was writing--"

"Perhaps she is writing a book," suggested Mellicent thoughtfully.  "She says she is going
to be an authoress when she grows up.  I think Robert knew what she was doing.  They were always
talking together and looking over books, and I heard him say to her, `Bring me all you have
finished, to look over.'  I said something to her about printing some photographs for Christmas
cards, and she said she could do nothing until after the nineteenth."

"The nineteenth!" echoed the vicar sharply.  "That is to-day.  We gather from that, then, that
Peggy had been busy with work, either by herself or in conjunction with Robert, which had to
be completed by to-day. Nobody has the least idea of what nature it was?  No?  Then I shall
go to Robert's room and see if there is anything lying about which can give me a clue."

"I'll go with you, sir," said Arthur, who was beginning to look a little anxious and uneasy,
as the moments passed by and brought no sign of his sister; but, alas, the scattered papers
on Rob's table gave no clue to the mystery!

When one is endeavouring to find a reason why a girl should mysteriously disappear from her
home, it does not help very much to find a few slips of paper on which are written such items
as "Tennyson's Poems, page 26," "Selections from British Authors, 203", "Macaulay's Essays,
97," etcetera.

Arthur and Mr Asplin looked at one another, puzzled and disappointed, and had no alternative
but to return to the dining-room and confess their failure.

"Would not it be a good thing to go up to the Larches, and hear what Robert has to say on the
subject?"  Arthur asked; and when he was told that Robert was in London he still held to his
suggestion.

"For someone else in the house may know about it," he declared.  "Rob may have confided in
his mother or sister.  At the worst we can get his address, and telegraph to him for information,
if she has not returned before we get back.  She might even have gone to the Larches herself
to--to see Rosalind!"

"Peggy doesn't like Rosalind.  She never goes to see her if she can help it.  I'm quite sure
she has not gone there," said Mellicent shrewdly. "It is more likely she has gone to Fraulein's
lodgings to tell her about Arthur.  She is fond of Fraulein."

The suggestion was not very brilliant, but it was hailed with eagerness by the listeners as
the most probable explanation yet offered.

"Then I'll tell you what we will do.  I'll go off to the Larches," cried Arthur, "and one of
you fellows can see Fraulein, and find out if Peggy has been there.  We must try every place,
likely and unlikely.  It is better than sitting here doing nothing."

Max frowned and hesitated.  "Or--er--or you might go to Fraulein, and I'll take the Larches!
It is a long walk for you after your journey," he suggested, with a sudden access of politeness,
"and there seems more probability that Fraulein may be able to help us.  You could go there
and back in a short time."

"Just as you like, of course.  It is all the same to me," returned Arthur, in a tone which
plainly intimated that it was nothing of the sort.  Mrs Asplin looked from one to the other
of the flushed faces, realising that even in the midst of anxiety the image of beautiful, golden-haired
Rosalind had a Will-o'-the-wisp attraction for the two big lads; but her husband saw nothing
of what lay behind the commonplace words, and said calmly--

"Very well, then, Max, be off with you as fast as you can go.  Find out if Robert has said
anything about the work which he has had on hand; find out his address in town, and, if possible,
where a telegram would reach him this evening.  Arthur will call at Fraulein's lodgings; and,
Oswald, you might go with him so far, and walk through the village.  Ask at old Mrs Gilpin's
shop if Miss Saville has been there, but don't talk about it too much; we don't want to make
more fuss than we can help. Keep your eyes open!"

The three lads departed without further delay; the vicar put on his coat and hat preparatory
to searching the garden and the lanes in the immediate neighbourhood, and the womenkind of
the household settled down to an hour of painful waiting.

Mrs Asplin lay back in her chair, with her hand to her head, now silent, now breaking out into
impetuous lamentations.  The fear lest any accident had happened to Peggy paralysed her with
dread.  Her thoughts went out to far-away India; she imagined the arrival of the ominous cablegram;
pictured it carried into the house by a native servant; saw the light die out of two happy
faces at the reading of the fatal words. "Oh, Peggy, Peggy!" she groaned.  "Oh, the poor father--the
poor mother! What will I do?  What will I do?  Oh, Peggy, dearie, come back I come back!"

Esther busied herself looking after a dozen little domestic arrangements, to which no one else
seemed capable of attendance, and Mellicent laid her head on her mother's lap, and never ceased
crying, except for one brief interval, when she darted upstairs to peep inside the old oak
chest, prompted thereto by a sudden reminiscence of the bride of the "Mistletoe Bough."  There
was no Peggy inside the chest, however; only a few blankets, and a very strong smell of camphor;
so Mellicent crept back to her footstool, and cried with redoubled energy. In the kitchen the
fat old cook sat with a hand planted on either knee, and thrilled the other servants with an
account of how "a cousin of me own brother-in-law, him that married our Annie, had a child
as went a-missing, as fine a girl as you could wish to see from June to January. Beautiful
kerly 'air, for all the world like Miss Mellicent's, and such nice ways with her!  Everybody
loved that child, gentle and simple. `Beller,' 'er name was, after her mother.  She went out
unbeknownst, just as it might be Miss Peggy, and they searched and better searched,"--cook's
hands waved up and down, and the heads of the listeners wagged in sympathy--"and never a trace
could they find.  'Er father--he's a stone-mason by trade, and getting good money--he knocked
off work, and his friends they knocked off too, and they searched the country far and wide.
Day and night I tell you they searched, a week on end, and poor Isabeller nearly off her head
with grief.  I've heard my sister say as she never tasted bite nor sup the whole time, and
was wasted to a shadow.  Eh, poor soul, it's hard to rare up a child, and have it go out smiling
and bonnie, and never see nothink of it again but its bones--for she had fallen into a lime
pit, had Beller, and it was nothing but her skeleton as they brought 'ome.  There was building
going on around there, and she was playing near the pit--childlike--just as it might be Miss
Peggy..."  Soon and on.  The horrors accumulated with every moment.  The housemaid had heard
tell of a beautiful little girl, the heiress to a big estate, who had been carried off by strolling
gipsies, and never been seen again by her sorrowing relatives; while the waitress hinted darkly
that the time might come when it would be a comfort to know force had been employed, for sharper
than a serpent's tooth was an ungrateful child, and she always had said that there was something
uncanny about that little Miss Saville!

The clock was striking nine o'clock when the first of the messengers came back to report his
failure; he was closely followed by a second; and last of all came Max, bringing word that
nothing had been seen or heard of Peggy at the Larches; that neither Lord Darcy nor Rosalind
had the faintest idea of the nature of the work which had just been completed; and, further,
that on this evening Robert was escorting his mother to some entertainment, so that even if
sent off at once a telegram could not reach him until a late hour.  Mrs Asplin turned her white
face from one speaker to the other, and, when the last word was spoken, broke into a paroxysm
of helpless weeping.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

THE SECRET CONFESSED.

"Something has happened!  Something terrible has happened to the child! And she was left in
our charge.  We are responsible.  Oh, if any harm has happened to Peggy, however, ever, ever,
can I bear to live and send the news to her parents--"

"My dearest, you have done your best; you could not have been kinder or more thoughtful.  No
blame can attach to you.  Remember that Peggy is in higher hands than yours.  However far from
us she may be, she can never stray out of God's keeping.  It all seems very dark and mysterious,
but--"

At this moment a loud rat-tat-tat sounded on the knocker, and with one accord the hearers darted
into the hall, and stood panting and gasping, while Arthur threw open the door.

"Telegram, sir!" said a sharp, young voice, and the brown envelope which causes so much agitation
in quiet households was thrust forward in a small cold hand.  Arthur looked at the address
and handed it to the vicar.

"It is for you, sir, but it cannot possibly be anything about--"

Mr Asplin tore open the envelope, glanced over the words, and broke into an exclamation of
amazement.  "It is!  It is from Peggy herself!--`Euston Station.  Returning by 10.30 train.
Please meet me at twelve o'clock.--Peggy.'  What in the world does it mean?"  He looked round
the group of anxious faces, only to see his own expression of bewilderment repeated on each
in turn.

"Euston!  Returning!  She is in London.  She is coming back from town!"

"She ran away to London, to-night when she was so happy, when Arthur had just arrived!  Why?
Why?  Why?"

"She must have caught the seven o'clock train."

"She must have left the house almost immediately after going upstairs to dress for dinner."

"Oh, father, why should she go to London?"

"I am quite unable to tell you, my dear," replied the vicar drily.  He looked at his wife's
white, exhausted face, and his eyes flashed with the "A-word-with-you-in-my-study" expression,
which argued ill for Miss Peggy's reception.  Mrs Asplin, however, was too thankful to know
of the girl's safety to have any thought for herself.  She began to smile, with the tears still
running down her face, and to draw long breaths of relief and satisfaction.

"It's no use trying to guess at that, Millie dear.  It is enough for me to know that she is
alive and well.  We shall just have to try and compose ourselves in patience until we hear
Peggy's own explanation. Let me see!  There is nearly an hour before you need set out.  What
can we do to pass the time as quickly as possible?"

"Have some coffee, I should say!  None of us have had too much dinner, and a little refreshment
would be very welcome after all this strain," said Arthur promptly, and Mrs Asplin eagerly
welcomed the suggestion.

"That's what I call a really practical proposal!  Ring the bell, dear, and I will order it
at once.  I am sure we shall all have thankful hearts while we drink it."  She looked appealingly
at Mr Asplin as she spoke; but there was no answering smile on his face, and the lines down
his cheeks looked deeper and grimmer than ever.

"Oh, goody, goody, goodness, aren't I glad I am not Peggy!" sighed Mellicent to herself; while
Arthur Saville pursed his lips together, and thought, "Poor little Peg!  She'll catch it. 
I've never seen the dominie look so savage.  This is a nice sort of treat for a fellow who
has been ordered away for rest and refreshment!  I wish the next two hours were safely over."

Wishing, unfortunately, however, can never carry us over the painful crises of our lives. 
We have to face them as best we may, and Arthur needed all his cheery confidence to sustain
him during the damp walk which followed, when the vicar tramped silently by his side, his shovel
hat pulled over his eyes, his mackintosh coat flapping to and fro in the wind.

They reached the station in good time, and punctually to the minute the lights of the London
express were seen in the distance.  The train drew up, and among the few passengers who alighted
the figure of Peggy, in her scarlet-trimmed hat, was easily distinguished.  She was assisted
out of the carriage by an elderly gentleman, in a big travelling coat, who stood by her side
as she looked about for her friends.  As Mr Asplin and Arthur approached, they only heard his
hearty, "Now you are all right!" and Peggy's elegant rejoinder, "Exceedingly indebted to you
for all your kindness!"  Then he stepped back into the carriage, and she came forward to meet
them, half shy, half smiling, "I--I am afraid that you--"

"We will defer explanations, Mariquita, if you please, until we reach home.  A fly is waiting.
We will return as quickly as possible," said the vicar frigidly; and the brother and sister
lagged behind as he led the way out of the station, gesticulating and whispering together in
furtive fashion.

"Oh, you Peggy!  Now you have done it!  No end of a row!"

"Couldn't help it!  Had to go.  Stick to me, Arthur, whatever you do!"

"Like a leech!  We'll worry through somehow.  Never say die!"  Then the fly was reached, and
they jolted home in silence.

Mrs Asplin and the four young folks were sitting waiting in the drawing-room, and each one
turned an eager, excited face towards the doorway as Peggy entered, her cheeks white, but with
shining eyes, and hair ruffled into little curls beneath the scarlet cap.  Mrs Asplin would
have rushed forward in welcome, but a look in her husband's face restrained her, and there
was a deathlike silence in the room as he took up his position by the mantelpiece.

"Mariquita," he said slowly, "you have caused us to-night some hours of the most acute and
painful anxiety which we have ever experienced.  You disappeared suddenly from among us, and
until ten o'clock, when your telegram arrived, we had not the faintest notion as to where you
could be.  The most tragic suspicions came to our minds.  We have spent the evening in rushing
to and fro, searching and inquiring in all directions.  Mrs Asplin has had a shock from which,
I fear, she will be some time in recovering.  Your brother's pleasure in his visit has been
spoiled.  We await your explanation.  I am at a loss to imagine any reason sufficiently good
to excuse such behaviour; but I will say no more until I have heard what you have to say."

Peggy stood like a prisoner at the bar, with hanging head and hands clasped together.  As the
vicar spoke of his wife, she darted a look at Mrs Asplin, and a quiver of emotion passed over
her face.  When he had finished she drew a deep breath, raised her head and looked him full
in the face with her bright, earnest eyes.

"I am sorry," she said slowly.  "I can't tell you in words how sorry I am.  I know it will
be difficult, but I hope you will forgive me.  I was thinking what I had better do while I
was coming back in the train, and I decided that I ought to tell you everything, even though
it is supposed to be a secret.  Robert will forgive me, and it is Robert's secret as much as
mine.  I'll begin at the beginning.  About five weeks ago Robert saw an advertisement of a
prize that was offered by a magazine.  You had to make up a calendar with quotations for every
day in the year, and the person who sent in the best selection would get thirty pounds.  Rob
wanted the money very badly to buy a microscope, and he asked me to help him.  I was to have
ten pounds for myself if we won, but I didn't care about that.  I just wanted to help Rob.
I said I would take the money, because I knew if I didn't he would not let me work so hard,
and I thought I would spend it in buying p-p-presents for you all at Christmas."--Peggy's voice
faltered at this point, and she gulped nervously several times before she could go on with
her story.--"We had to work very hard, because the time was so short. Robert had not seen the
advertisement until it had been out some time. I printed the headings on the cards; that is
why I sat so much in my own room.  The last fortnight I have been writing every morning before
six o'clock.  Oh, you can't think how difficult it was to get it finished, but Robert was determined
to go on; he thought our chance was very good, because he had found some beautiful extracts,
and translated others, and the pages really looked pretty and dainty.  The manuscript had to
be in London this morning; if it missed the post last night, all our work would have been wasted,
and at the last moment Lady Darcy took Rob away with her, and I was left with everything to
finish.  I may have slept a little bit the last two nights; I did lie down for an hour or two,
and I may have had a doze, but I don't think so!  I wrote the last word this morning after
the breakfast-bell had rung, and I made up the parcel at twelve o'clock.  I thought of going
out and posting it then; of course, that is what I should have done, but,"--her voice trembled
once more--"I was so tired!  I thought I would give it to the postman myself, and that would
do just as well.  I didn't put it with the letters because I was afraid someone would see the
address and ask questions, and Rob had said that I was to keep it a secret until we knew whether
we had won.  I left the parcel on my table.  Then Arthur came!  I was so happy--there was so
much to talk about--we had tea--it seemed like five minutes.  Everyone was amazed when we found
it was time to dress, but even then I forgot all about the calendar.  I only remembered that
Arthur was here, and was going to stay for four days, and all the way upstairs I was saying
to myself, `I'm happy, I'm happy; oh I am happy!' because, you know, though you are so kind,
you have many relatives belonging to you whom you love better than me, and my own people are
all far-away, and sometimes I've been very lonely!  I thought of nothing but Arthur, and then
I opened the door of my room, and there, before my eyes, was the parcel--Rob's parcel that
he had trusted to me-- that I had solemnly promised to post in time--"

She stopped short, and there was a gasp of interest and commiseration among the listeners.
Peggy caught it; she glanced sharply at the vicar's face, saw its sternness replaced by a momentary
softness, and was quick to make the most of her opportunity.  Out flew the dramatic little
hand, her eyes flashed, her voice thrilled with suppressed excitement.

"It lay there before my eyes, and I stood and looked at it.--I thought of nothing, but just
stood and stared.  I heard you all come upstairs, and the doors shut, and Arthur's voice laughing
and talking; but there was only one thing I could remember--I had forgotten Rob's parcel, and
he would come back, and I should have to tell him, and see his face!  I felt as if I were paralysed,
and then suddenly I seized the parcel in my hands, and flew downstairs.  I put on my cap and
cloak and went out into the garden.  I didn't know what I was going to do, but I was going
to do something!  I ran on and on, through the village, down towards the station.  I knew it
was too late for the post-office, but I had a sort of feeling that if I were at the station
something might be done.  Just as I got there a train came in, and I heard the porter call
out, `London express.'  I thought--No!  I did not think at all--I just ran up to a carriage
and took a seat, and the door banged, and away we went.  The porter came and asked for my ticket,
and I had a great deal of trouble to convince him that I had only come from here, and not all
the way. There was an old lady in the carriage, and she told him that it was quite true, for
she had seen me come in.  When we went off again, she looked at me very hard, and said, `Are
you in trouble, dear?' and I said, `Yes, I am; but oh, please don't talk to me!  Do please
leave me alone!' for I had begun to realise what I had done, and that I couldn't be back for
hours and hours, and that you would all be anxious and unhappy.  I think I was as miserable
as you were when I sent off that telegram.  I posted the parcel in London, and went and sat
in the waiting-room.  I had an hour and a half to wait, and I was wretched and nervous and
horribly hungry.  I had no money left except a few coppers, and I was afraid to spend them
and have nothing left.  It seemed like a whole day, but at last the train came in, and I saw
an old gentleman with white hair standing on the platform.  I took a fancy to his appearance,
so I walked up to him, and bowed, and said, `Excuse me, sir--I find myself in a dilemma!  Will
you allow me to travel in the same carriage as yourself?'  He was most agreeable.  He had travelled
all over the world, and talked in the most interesting fashion, but I could not listen to his
conversation.  I was too unhappy.  Then we arrived, and Mr Asplin called me `M-M-Mariquita!'
and w-wouldn't let you kiss me--"

Her voice broke helplessly this time, and she stood silent, with quivering lip, while sighs
and sobs of sympathy echoed from every side. Mrs Asplin cast a glance at her husband, half
defiant, half appealing, met a smile of assent, and rushed impetuously to Peggy's side.

"My darling!  I'll kiss you now.  You see we knew nothing of your trouble, dear, and we were
so very, very anxious.  Mr Asplin is not angry with you any longer, are you, Austin?  You know
now that she had no intention of grieving us, and that she is truly sorry--"

"I never thought--I never thought,"--sobbed Peggy; and the vicar gave a slow, kindly smile.

"Ah, Peggy, that is just what I complain about.  You don't think, dear, and that causes all
the trouble.  No, I am not angry any longer.  I realise that the circumstances were peculiar,
and that your distress was naturally very great.  At the same time, it was a most mad thing
for a girl of your age to rush off by rail, alone, and at night-time, to a place like London.
You say that you had only a few coppers left in your purse.  Now suppose there had been no
train back to-night, what would you have done?  It does not bear thinking of, my dear; or that
you should have waited alone in the station for so long, or thrown yourself on strangers for
protection.  What would your parents have said to such an escapade?"

Peggy sighed, and cast down her eyes.  "I think they would have been cross too.  I am sure
they would have been anxious, but I know they would forgive me when I was sorry, and promised
that I really and truly would try to be better and more thoughtful!  They would say, `Peggy
dear, you have been sufficiently punished!  Consider yourself absolved!'"

The vicar's lips twitched, and a twinkle came into his eye.  "Well then, I will say the same!
I am sure you have regretted your hastiness by this time, and it will be a lesson to you in
the future.  For Arthur's sake, as well as your own, we will say no more on the subject.  It
would be a pity if his visit were spoiled.  Just one thing, Peggy, to show you that, after
all, grown-up people are wiser than young ones, and that it is just as well to refer to them
now and then, in matters of difficulty. Has it ever occurred to you that the mail went up to
London by the very train in which you yourself travelled, and that by giving your parcel to
the guard it could still have been put in the bag?  Did that thought never occur to your wise
little brain?"

Peggy made a gesture as of one heaping dust and ashes on her head.  "I never did," she said,
"not for a single moment!  And I thought I was so clever!  I am prostrate with confusion!"

CHAPTER NINETEEN.

ROSALIND'S BALL.

In consideration of Arthur's presence and of the late hours and excitement of the night before,
the next day was observed as a holiday in the vicarage.  Mrs Asplin stayed in bed until lunch-time,
the boys went for a bicycle ride, and Peggy and her brother had a delightful chat together
by the schoolroom fire, when he told her more details about his own plans than he had been
able to touch upon in a dozen letters.

"The preliminary examination for Sandhurst begins on the 26th this year," he explained, "and
so far as I can make out I shall romp through it.  I am going to take all the subjects in Class
One--mathematics, Latin, French, geometrical drawing, and English composition; I'll astonish
them in the last subject!  Plenty of dash and go, eh, Peggy,-- that's the style to fetch 'em!
In Class Two you can only take two subjects, so I'm going in for chemistry and physics.  I
rather fancy myself in physics, and if I don't come out at the head of the list, or precious
near the head, it won't be for want of trying.  I have worked like a nigger these last six
months; between ourselves, I thought I had worked too hard a few days ago; I felt so stupid
and dizzy, and my head ached until I could hardly open my eyes.  If I had not come away, I
believe I should have broken down, but I'm better already, and by Tuesday I shall be as fit
as a fiddle.  I hope I do well, it would be so jolly to cable out the news to the old pater;
and I say, Peg, I don't mean to leave Sandhurst without bringing home something to keep as
a souvenir.  At the end of each Christmas term a sword is presented to the cadet who passes
out first in the final exam.--`The Anson Memorial Sword.'  Mariquita!"--Arthur smote his breast,
and struck a fierce and warlike attitude,--"that sword is mine!  In the days to come, when
you are old and grey-headed, you will see that rusty blade hanging over my ancestral hearth,
and tell in faltering tones the story of the gallant youth who wrested it from his opponents."

"Ha, ha!" responded Peggy deeply.  There was no particular meaning in the exclamation, but
it seemed right and fitting in the connection, and had a smack of melodrama which was quite
to her taste.  "Of course you will be first, Arthur!" she added; "and, oh dear! how proud I
shall be when I see you in all your uniform!  I am thankful all my men relatives are soldiers,
they are so much more interesting than civilians.  It would break my heart to think of you
as a civilian!  Of course wars are somewhat disconcerting, but then one always hopes there
won't be wars."

"I don't!" cried Arthur loudly.  "No, no--active service for me, and plenty of it!

  "`Come one, come all, this rock shall fly
  From its firm base as soon as I!'

"That's my motto, and my ambition is the Victoria Cross, and I'll get that too before I'm done;
you see if I don't!  It's the ambition of my life, Peg.  I lie awake and think of that little
iron cross; I go to sleep and dream of it, and see the two words dancing before my eyes in
letters of fire, `For Valour,' `For Valour,' `For Valour.'  Ah!"--he drew a deep breath of
excitement--"I don't think there is anything in the world I should envy, if I could only gain
that."

Peggy gazed at him with kindling eyes.  "You are a soldier's son," she said, "and the grandson
of a soldier, and the great-grandson of a soldier; it's in your blood; you can't help it--it's
in my blood too, Arthur!  I give you my solemn word of honour that if the French or Germans
came over to invade this land, I'd--" Peggy seized the ruler and waved it in the air with a
gesture of fiercest determination--"I'd fight them!  There!  I'd shoot at them; I'd go out
and spike the guns; I'd-- I'd climb on the house-tops and throw stones at them.  You needn't
laugh, I tell you I should be terrible!  I feel as if I could face a whole regiment myself.
The spirit--the spirit of my ancestors is in my breast, Arthur Reginald, and woe betide that
enemy who tries to wrest from me my native land!"  Peggy went off into a shriek of laughter,
in which Arthur joined, until the sound of the merry peals reached Mrs Asplin's ears as she
lay wearily on her pillow, and brought a smile to her pale face.  "Bless the dears!  How happy
they are!" she murmured to herself; nor even suspected that it was a wholesale massacre of
foreign nations which had been the cause of this gleeful outburst.

Arthur left the vicarage on Tuesday evening, seemingly much refreshed by the few days' change,
though he still complained of his head, and pressed his hand over his eyes from time to time
as though in pain.  The parting from Peggy was more cheerful than might have been expected,
for in a few more weeks Christmas would be at hand, when, as he himself expressed it, he hoped
to return with blushing honours thick upon him. Peggy mentally expended her whole ten pounds
in a present for the dear handsome fellow, and held her head high in the consciousness of owning
a brother who was destined to be Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the years to come.

The same evening Robert returned from his visit to London.  He had heard of Peggy's escapade
from his father and sister, and was by no means so grateful as that young lady had expected.

"What in all the world possessed you to play such a mad trick?" he queried bluntly.  "It makes
me ill to think of it.  Rushing off to London on a wet, foggy night, never even waiting to
inquire if there was a return train, or to count if you had enough money to see you through!
Goodness only knows what might have happened!  You are careless enough in an ordinary way,
but I must say I gave you credit for more sense than that."

"Well, but, Rob," pleaded Peggy, aggrieved, "I don't think you need scold!  I did it for you,
and I thought you would be pleased."

"Did you indeed?  Well, you are mightily mistaken; I wouldn't have let you do a thing like
that for all the microscopes in the world.  I don't care a rap for the wretched old microscope."

"Oh! oh!"

"In comparison, I mean.  Of course I should have been glad to get it if it had come to me in
an ordinary way, but I was not so wrapped up in the idea that I would not have been reasonable,
if you had come to me quietly and explained that you had missed the post."

Peggy shook her head sagely.  "You think so now, because the danger is over, and you are sure
it can't happen.  But I know better.  I can tell you exactly what would have happened.  You
wouldn't have stormed or raged, it would have been better if you had, and sooner over; you
would just have stood still, and--glared at me!  When I'd finished speaking, you would have
swallowed two or three times over, as if you were gulping down something which you dared not
say, and then turned on your heel and marched out of the room.  That's what you would have
done, my dear and honourable sir, and you know it!"

Robert hung his head and looked self-conscious.

"Well, if I had!  A fellow can't hide all he feels in the first moment of disappointment. 
But I should have got over it, and you know very well that I should never have brought it up
against you.  `Glared!' What if I did glare?  There is nothing very terrible in that, is there?"

"Yes, there is.  I could not have borne it, when I had been trying so hard to help you.  And
it would not have been only the first few minutes.  Every time when you were quiet and depressed,
when you looked at your specimens through your little old glass and sighed, and pitched it
away, as I've seen you do scores and scores of times, I should have felt that it was my fault,
and been in the depths of misery.  No, no, I'm sorry to the depths of my heart that I scared
dear Mrs Asplin and the rest, but it is a matter of acute satisfaction to me to know that your
chance has in no way been hindered by your confidence in me!" and Peggy put her head on one
side, and coughed in a faint and ladylike manner, which brought the twinkle back into Robert's
eyes.

"Good old Mariquita!" he cried, laughing.  "`Acute satisfaction' is good, Mariquita--decidedly
good!  You will make your name yet in the world of letters.  Well, as I said before, you are
a jolly little brick, and the best partner a fellow ever had!  Mind you, I tell you straight
that I think you behaved badly in cutting off like that; but I'll stand by you to the others,
and not let them sit upon you while I am there."

"Thanks!" said Peggy meekly.  "But, oh, I beseech of you, don't bring up the subject if you
can help it!  I'm tired to death of it all!  The kindest thing you can do is to talk hard about
something else, and give them a fresh excitement to think about.  Talk about--about--about
Rosalind if you will; anything will do--only, for pity's sake, leave me alone, and pretend
there is not such a thing in the world as a calendar!"

"Right you are!" said Robert, laughing.  "I'll steer clear of the rocks! And as it happens,
I have got a piece of news that will put your doings into the background at one fell swoop.
Rosalind is going to give a party!  The Earl and Countess of Berkhampton are coming down to
the Larches the week after next, and are going to bring their two girls with them.  They are
great lanky things, with about as much `go' in the pair as in one of your little fingers; but
this party is to be given in their honour.  The mater has asked everyone of a right age within
a dozen miles around, and the house will be crammed with visitors.  Your card is coming to-morrow,
and I hope you will give me the honour of the first round, and as many as possible after that."

"The first, with pleasure; I won't promise any more until I see how we get on.  It doesn't
seem appropriate to think of your dancing, Rob; there is something too heavy and serious in
your demeanour.  Oswald is different; he would make a charming dancing master.  Oh, it will
be an excitement!  Mellicent will not be able to eat or sleep for thinking of it; and poor
Mrs Asplin will be running up seams on the sewing-machine, and making up ribbon bows from this
day to that.  I'm glad I have a dress all ready, and shan't be bothered with any trying on!
You don't know what it is to stand first on one leg and then on the other, to be turned and
pulled about as if you were a dummy, and have pins stuck into you as if you were a pin-cushion!
I adore pretty clothes, but every time I go to the dressmaker's I vow and declare that I shall
take to sacks.  Tell them at dinner, do, and they will talk about it for the rest of the evening!"

Peggy's prophecy came true, for the subject of Rosalind's party became a topic of such absorbing
interest as left room for little else during the next few weeks.  New dresses had to be bought
and made for the girls, and Peggy superintended the operations of the village dressmaker with
equal satisfaction to herself and her friends.

Rosalind appeared engrossed in preparations, and two or three times a week, as the girls trudged
along the muddy roads, with Fraulein lagging in the rear, the jingle of bells would come to
their ears, and Rosalind's two white long-tailed ponies would come dashing past, drawing the
little open carriage in which their mistress sat, half-hidden among a pile of baskets and parcels.
She was always beautiful and radiant, and as she passed she would turn her head over her shoulders
and look at the three mud-bespattered pedestrians with a smile of pitying condescension, which
made Peggy set her teeth and draw her eyebrows together in an ominous frown.

One day she condescended to stop and speak a few words from her throne among the cushions.

"How de do?  So sowwy not to have been to see you!  Fwightfully busy, don't you know.  We are
decowating the wooms, and don't know how to finish in time.  It's going to be quite charming!"

"We know!  We know!  Rob told us.  I'm dying to see it.  You should ask Peggy to help you,
if you are in a hurry.  She's s-imply splendid at decorations!  Mother says she never knew
anyone so good at it as Peggy!" cried Mellicent, with an outburst of gushing praise, in acknowledgment
of which she received a thunderous frown and such a sharp pinch on the arm as penetrated through
all her thick winter wrappings.

Rosalind, however, only ejaculated, "Oh, weally!" in an uninterested manner, and whipped up
her ponies without taking any further notice of the suggestion; but it had taken root in her
mind all the same, and she did not forget to question her brother on the first opportunity.

Mellicent Asplin had said that Peggy Saville was clever at decoration. Was it true, and would
it be the least use asking her to come and help in the decorations?

Robert laughed, and wagged his head with an air of proud assurance.

Clever!  Peggy?  She was a witch!  She could work wonders!  If you set her down in an empty
room, and gave her two-and-sixpence to transform it into an Alhambra, he verily believed she
could do it.  The way in which she had rigged up the various characters for the Shakespeare
reading was nothing short of miraculous.  Yes, indeed, Peggy would be worth a dozen ordinary
helpers.  The question was, Would she come?

"Certainly she will come.  I'll send down for her at once," said Rosalind promptly, and forthwith
sat down and wrote a dainty little note, not to Peggy herself, but to Mrs Asplin, stating that
she had heard great accounts of Peggy Saville's skill in the art of decoration, and begging
that she might be allowed to come up to the Larches to help with the final arrangements, arriving
as early as possible on the day of the party, and bringing her box with her, so as to be saved
the fatigue of returning home to dress.  It was a prettily worded letter, and Mrs Asplin was
dismayed at the manner of its reception.

"No, Peggy Saville won't!" said that young person, pursing her lips and tossing her head in
her most high and mighty manner.  "She won't do anything of the sort!  Why should I go?  Let
her ask some of her own friends!  I'm not her friend!  I should simply loathe to go!"

"My dear Peggy!  When you are asked to help!  When this entertainment is given for your pleasure,
and you can be of real use--"

"I never asked her to give the party!  I don't care whether I go or not! She is simply making
use of me for her own convenience!"

"It is not the first or only time that you have been asked, as you know well, Peggy.  And sometimes
you have enjoyed yourself very much.  You said you would never forget the pink luncheon.  In
spite of all you say, you owe Rosalind thanks for some pleasant times; and now you can be of
some service to her.  Well, I'm not going to force you, dear.  I hate unwilling workers, and
if it's not in your heart to go, stay at home, and settle with your conscience as best you can."

Peggy groaned with sepulchral misery.

"Wish I hadn't got no conscience!  Tiresome, presuming thing--always poking itself forward
and making remarks when it isn't wanted.  I suppose I shall have to go, and run about from
morning till night, holding a pair of scissors, and nasty little balls of string, for Rosalind's
use!  Genius indeed!  What's the use of talking about genius? I know very well I shall not
be allowed to do anything but run about and wait upon her.  It's no use staring at me, Mrs
Asplin.  I mean it all--every single word."

"No, you don't, Peggy!  No, you don't, my little kind, warm-hearted Peggy!  I know better than
that!  It's just that foolish tongue that is running away with you, dearie.  In your heart
you are pleased to do a service for a friend, and are going to put your whole strength into
doing it as well and tastefully as it can be done."

"I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm savage, and it's no use pretending--"

"Yes, you are!  I know it!  What is the good of having a special gift if one doesn't put it
to good use?  Ah, that's the face I like to see!  I didn't recognise my Peggy with that ugly
frown.  I'll write and say you'll come with pleasure."

"It's to please you, then, not Rosalind!" said Peggy obstinately.  But Mrs Asplin only laughed,
dropped a kiss upon her cheek, and walked away to answer the invitation forthwith.

CHAPTER TWENTY.

AT THE LARCHES.

The next morning, immediately after breakfast, Peggy went up to her own room to pack for her
visit to the Larches.  The long dress-box, which had been stored away ever since its arrival,
was brought out, and its contents displayed to an admiring audience, consisting of Mrs Asplin,
Esther, Mellicent, and Mary the housemaid.

Everything was there that the heart of girl could desire, and a mother's forethought provide
for her darling's use when she was far-away.  A dress of cobweb Indian muslin embroidered in
silk, a fan of curling feathers, a dear little satin pocket in which to keep the lace handkerchief,
rolls of ribbons, dainty white shoes, with straggly silk stockings rolled into the toes.

Peggy displayed one article after another, while Mellicent groaned and gurgled with delight;
Mary exclaimed, "My, Miss Peggy, but you will be smart!" and Mrs Asplin stifled a sigh at the
thought of her own inferior preparations.

Punctually at ten o'clock the carriage drove up to the door, and off Peggy drove, not altogether
unwillingly, now that it had come to the pinch, for after all it is pleasant to be appreciated,
and, when a great excitement is taking place in the neighbourhood, it is only human to wish
to be in the thick of the fray.

Lady Darcy welcomed her guest with gracious kindness, and, as soon as she had taken off her
hat and jacket in the dressing-room which was allotted to her use, she was taken straight away
to the chief room, where the work of decoration was being carried briskly forward.  The village
joiner was fitting mirrors into the corners and hammering with deafening persistence, a couple
of gardeners were arranging banks of flowers and palms, and Rosalind stood in the midst of
a bower of greenery, covered from head to foot in a smock of blue linen, and with a pair of
gardening gloves drawn over her hands.

She gave a little cry of relief and satisfaction as Peggy entered.

"Oh, Mawiquita, so glad you have come!  Mother is so busy that she can't be with me at all,
and these wretched bwanches pwick my fingers!  Do look wound, and say how it looks!  This is
weally the servants' hall, you know, as we have not a pwoper ballroom, and it is so square
and high that it is perfectly dweadful to decowate!  A long, narrow woom is so much better!"

Peggy thought the arrangements tasteful and pretty; but she could not gush over the effect,
which, in truth, was in no way original or striking.  There seemed little to be done in the
room itself, so she suggested an adjournment into the outer hall, which seemed to offer unique
opportunities.

"That space underneath the staircase!" she cried eagerly.  "Oh, Rosalind, we could make it
look perfectly sweet with all the beautiful Eastern things that you have brought home from
your travels!  Let us make a little harem, with cushions to sit on, and hanging lamps, and
Oriental curtains for drapery.  We could do it while the men are finishing this room, and be
ready to come back to it after lunch."

"Oh, what a sweet idea!  Mawiquita, you are quite too clever!" cried Rosalind, aglow with pleasure.
"Let us begin at once.  It will be ever so much more intewesting than hanging about here."

She thrust her hand through Peggy's arm as she spoke, and the two girls went off on a tour
through the house to select the most suitable articles for their decoration of the "harem."
There was no lack of choice, for the long suite of reception-rooms was full of treasures, and
Peggy stopped every few minutes to point with a small forefinger and say, "That screen, please!
That table!  That stool!" to the servants who had been summoned in attendance.  The smaller
things, such as ornaments, table-cloths, and lamps she carried herself, while Rosalind murmured
sweetly, "Oh, don't twouble!  You mustn't, weally!  Let me help you!" and stood with her arms
hanging by her side, without showing the faintest sign of giving the offered help.

As the morning passed away, Peggy found indeed that the Honourable Miss Darcy was a broken
reed to lean upon in the way of assistance.  She sat on a stool and looked on while the other
workers hammered and pinned and stitched--so that Peggy's prophecy as to her own subordinate
position was exactly reversed, and the work of supervision was given entirely into her hands.

It took nearly two hours to complete the decorations of the "harem," but when all was finished
the big ugly space beneath the staircase was transformed into as charming a nook as it is possible
to imagine. Pieces of brilliant flag embroidery from Cairo draped the farther wall, a screen
of carved work shut out the end of the passage, gauzy curtains of gold and blue depended in
festoons from the ascending staircase, and stopped just in time to leave a safe place for a
hanging lamp of wrought iron and richly coloured glass.  On the floor were spread valuable
rugs and piles of bright silken cushions, while on an inlaid table stood a real Turkish hookah
and a brass tray with the little egg-shaped cups out of which travellers in the East are accustomed
to sip the strong black coffee of the natives.

Peggy lifted the ends of her apron in her hands and executed a dance of triumph on her own
account when all was finished, and Rosalind said, "Weally, we have been clever!  I think we
may be proud of ourselves!" in amiable effusion.

The two girls went off to luncheon in a state of halcyon amiability which was new indeed in
the history of their acquaintance, and Lady Darcy listened with an amused smile to their rhapsodies
on the subject of the morning's work, promising faithfully not to look at anything until the
right moment should arrive, and she should be summoned to gaze and admire.

By the time that the workers were ready to return to the room, the men had finished the arrangements
at which they had been at work before lunch, and were beginning to tack festoons of evergreens
along the walls, the dull paper of which had been covered with fluting of soft pink muslin.
The effect was heavy and clumsy in the extreme, and Rosalind stamped her foot with an outburst
of fretful anger.

"Stop putting up those wreaths!  Stop at once!  They are simply hideous! It weminds me of a
penny weading in the village schoolwoom!  You might as well put up `God save the Queen' and
`A Mewwy Chwistmas' at once! Take them down this minute, Jackson!  I won't have them!"

The man touched his forehead, and began pulling out the nails in half-hearted fashion.

"Very well, miss, as you wish.  Seems a pity, though, not to use 'em, for it took me all yesterday
to put 'em together.  It's a sin to throw 'em away."

"I won't have them in the house, if they took you a week!"  Rosalind replied sharply, and she
turned on her heel and looked appealingly in Peggy's face.  "It's a howwid failure!  The woom
looks so stiff and stwaight--like a pink box with nothing in it!  Mother won't like it a bit.
What can we do to make it better?"

Peggy scowled, pursed up her lips, pressed her hand to her forehead, and strode up and down
the room, rolling her eyes from side to side, and going through all the grimaces of one in
search of inspiration. Rosalind was right: unless some device were found by which the shape
of the room could be disguised, the decorations must be pronounced more or less a failure.
She craned her head to the ceiling, and suddenly beamed in triumph.

"I have it!  The very thing!  We will fasten the garlands to that middle beam, and loop up
the ends at intervals all round the walls.  That will break the squareness, and make the room
look like a tent, with a ceiling of flowers."

"Ah-h!" cried Rosalind; and clasped her hands with a gesture of relief. "Of course!  The vewy
thing!  We ought to have thought of it at the beginning.  Get the ladder at once, Jackson,
and put in a hook or wing, or something to hold the ends; and be sure that it is strong enough.
What a good thing that the weaths are weady!  You see, your work will not be wasted after all."

She was quite gracious in her satisfaction, and for the next two hours she and Peggy were busily
occupied superintending the hanging of the evergreen wreaths and in arranging bunches of flowers
to be placed at each point where the wreaths were fastened to the wall.  At the end of this
time, Rosalind was summoned to welcome the distinguished visitors who had arrived by the afternoon
train.  She invited Peggy to accompany her to the drawing-room, but in a hesitating fashion,
and with a glance round the disordered room, which said, as plainly as words could do, that
she would be disappointed if the invitation were accepted; and Peggy, transformed in a moment
into a poker of pride and dignity, declared that she would prefer to remain where she was until
all was finished.

"Well, it weally would be better, wouldn't it?  I will have a tway sent in to you here, and
do, Mawiquita, see that evewything is swept up and made tidy at once, for I shall bring them
in to look wound diwectly after tea, and we must have the wooms tidy!"

Rosalind tripped away, and Peggy was left to herself for a lonely and troublesome hour.  The
tea-tray was brought in, and she was just seating herself before an impromptu table, when up
came a gardener to say that one of "these 'ere wreaths seemed to hang uncommon near the gas-bracket.
It didn't seem safe like."  And off she went in a panic of consternation to see what could
be done.  There was nothing for it but to move the wreath some inches farther away, which involved
moving the next also, and the next, and the next, so as to equalise the distances as much as
possible; and by the time that they were settled to Peggy's satisfaction, lo, table and tray
had been whisked out of sight by some busy pair of hands, and only a bare space met her eyes.
This was blow number one, for, after working hard all afternoon, tea and cake come as a refreshment
which one would not readily miss.  She cheered herself, however, by putting dainty finishing
touches here and there, seeing that the lamp was lighted in the "harem" outside, and was busy
placing fairy lamps among the shrubs which were to screen the band, when a babel of voices
from outside warned her that the visitors were approaching. Footsteps came nearer and nearer,
and a chorus of exclamations greeted the sight of the "harem."  The door stood open, Peggy
waited for Rosalind's voice to call and bid her share the honours, but no summons came.  She
heard Lady Darcy's exclamation, and the quick, strong tones of the strange countess.

"Charming, charming; quite a stroke of genius!  I never saw a more artistic little nook.  What
made you think of it, my dear?"

"Ha!" said Peggy to herself, and took a step forward, only to draw back in dismay, as a light
laugh reached her ear, followed by Rosalind's careless--

"Oh, I don't know; I wanted to make it pwetty, don't you know; it was so dweadfully bare, and
there seemed no other way."

Then there was a rustle of silk skirts, and the two ladies entered the room, followed by their
respective daughters, Rosalind beautiful and radiant, and the Ladies Berkhampton with their
chins poked forward, and their elbows thrust out in ungainly fashion.  They paused on the threshold,
and every eye travelled up to the wreath-decked ceiling.  A flush of pleasure came into Lady
Darcy's pale cheeks, and she listened to the countess's compliments with sparkling eyes.

"It is all the work of this clever child," she said, laying her hand fondly on Rosalind's shoulder.
"I have had practically nothing to do with the decorations.  This is the first time I have
been in the room to-day, and I had no idea that the garlands were to be used in this way. I
thought they were for the walls."

"I congratulate you, Rosalind!  You are certainly very happy in your arrangements," said the
countess cordially.  Then she put up her eyeglass and stared inquiringly at Peggy, who stood
by with her hair fastened back in its usual pigtail, and a big white apron pinned over her dress.

"She thinks I am the kitchen-maid!" said Peggy savagely to herself; but there was little fear
of such a mistake, and, the moment that Lady Darcy noticed the girl's presence, she introduced
her kindly enough, if with somewhat of a condescending air.

"This is a little friend of Rosalind's who has come up to help.  She is fond of this sort of
work," she said; then, before any of the strangers had time to acknowledge the introduction,
she added hastily, "And now I am sure you must all be tired after your journey, and will be
glad to go to your rooms and rest.  It is quite wicked of me to keep you standing. Let me take
you upstairs at once!"

They sailed away with the same rustle of garments, the same babel of high-toned voices, and
Peggy stood alone in the middle of the deserted room.  No one had asked her to rest, or suggested
that she might be tired; she had been overlooked and forgotten in the presence of the distinguished
visitor.  She was only a little girl who was "fond" of this sort of work, and, it might be
supposed, was only too thankful to be allowed to help!  The house sank into silence.  She waited
for half an hour longer, in the hope that someone would remember her presence, and then, tired,
hungry, and burning with repressed anger, crept upstairs to her own little room and fell asleep
upon the couch.

CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.

ANOTHER ACCIDENT!

Dinner was served unusually early that evening, and was an embarrassing ordeal from which Peggy
was thankful to escape.

On her way upstairs, however, Rosalind called her back with an eager petition.

"Oh, Peggy! would you mind awwanging some flowers?  A big hamper has just awwived from town,
and the servants are all so dweadfully busy.  I must get dwessed in time to help mother to
weceive, but it wouldn't matter if you were a few minutes late.  Thanks so much!  Awfully obliged."

She gave her thanks before an assent had been spoken, and tripped smilingly away, while Peggy
went back to the big room to find a great tray full of hothouse treasures waiting to be arranged,
and no availing vases in which to place them.  The flowers, however, were so beautiful, and
the fronds of maidenhair so green and graceful, that the work was a pleasure; she enjoyed discovering
unlikely places in which to group them, and lingered so long over her arrangements that the
sudden striking of the clock sent her flying upstairs in a panic of consternation.  Another
quarter of an hour and the vicarage party would arrive, for they had been bidden a little in
advance of the rest, so that Robert might help his mother and sister in receiving their guests.
Peggy tore off dress and apron, and made all the speed she could, but she was still standing
in dressing-jacket and frilled white petticoat, brushing out her long waves of hair when the
door opened and Esther and Mellicent entered.  They had begged to be shown to Miss Saville's
room, and came rustling in, smiling and beaming, with woollen caps over their heads, snow-shoes
on their feet, and fleecy shawls swathed round and round their figures, and fastened with a
hairpin on the left shoulder, in secure and elegant fashion.  Peggy stood, brush in hand, staring
at them and shaking with laughter.

"He! he! he!  I hope you are warm enough!  Esther looks like a sausage, and Mellicent looks
like a dumpling.  Come here, and I'll unwind you. You look as if you could not move an inch,
hand or foot."

"It was mother," Mellicent explained.  "She was so afraid we would catch cold.  Oh, Peggy,
you are not half dressed.  You will be late!  Whatever have you been doing?  Have you had a
nice day?  Did you enjoy it?  What did you have for dinner?"

Peggy waved her brush towards the door in dramatic warning.

"Rosalind's room!" she whispered.  "Don't yell, my love, unless you wish every word to be overheard.
This is her dressing-room, which she lent to me for the occasion, so there's only a door between
us.--There, now, you are free.  Oh, dear me, how you have squashed your sash!  You really must
remember to lift it up when you sit down.  You had better stand with your back to the fire,
to take out the creases."

Mellicent's face clouded for a moment, but brightened again as she caught sight of her reflection
in the swing glass.  Crumples or no crumples, there was no denying that blue was a becoming
colour.  The plump, rosy cheeks dimpled with satisfaction, and the flaxen head was twisted
to and fro to survey herself in every possible position.

"Is my hair right at the back?  How does the bow look?  I haven't burst, have I?  I thought
I heard something crack in the cab.  Do you think I will do?"

"Put on your slippers, and I'll tell you.  Anyone would look a fright in evening dress and
snow-shoes."

Peggy's answer was given with a severity which sent Mellicent waddling across the room to turn
out the contents of the bag which lay on the couch, but the next moment came a squeal of consternation,
and there she stood in the attitude of a tragedy queen, with staring eyes, parted lips, and
two shabby black slippers grasped in either hand.

"M-m-m-my old ones!" she gasped in horror-stricken accents. "B-b-b-brought them by mistake!"
It was some moments before her companions fully grasped the situation, for the new slippers
had been black too, and of much the same make as those now exhibited.  Mrs Asplin had had many
yearnings over white shoes and stockings, all silk and satin, and tinkling diamond buckles
like those which had been displayed in Peggy's dress-box.  Why should not her darlings have
dainty possessions like other girls?  It went to her heart to think what an improvement these
two articles would make in the simple costumes; then she remembered her husband's delicate
health, his exhaustion at the end of the day, and the painful effort with which he nerved himself
to fresh exertions, and felt a bigger pang at the thought of wasting money so hardly earned.
As her custom was on such occasions, she put the whole matter before the girls, talking to
them as friends, and asking their help in her decision.

"You see, darlings," she said, "I want to do my very best for you, and if it would be a real
disappointment not to have these things, I'll manage it somehow, for once in a way.  But it's
a question whether you would have another chance of wearing them, and it seems a great deal
of money to spend for just one evening, when poor dear father--"

"Oh, mother, no, don't think of it!  Black ones will do perfectly well. What can it matter
what sort of shoes and stockings we wear?  It won't make the least difference in our enjoyment,"
said Esther the sensible; but Mellicent was by no means of this opinion.

"I don't know about that!  I love white legs!" she sighed dolefully. "All my life long it has
been my ambition to have white legs.  Silk ones with little bits of lace let in down the front,
like Peggy's.  They're so beautiful!  It doesn't seem a bit like a party to wear black stockings;
only of course I know I must, for I'd hate to waste father's money.  When I grow up I shall
marry a rich man, and have everything I want.  It's disgusting to be poor...  Will they be
nice black slippers, mother, with buckles on them?"

"Yes, dearie.  Beauties!  Great big buckles!" said Mrs Asplin lovingly; and a few days later
a box had come down from London, and the slippers had been chosen out of a selection of "leading
novelties"; worn with care and reverence the previous evening, "to take off the stiffness,"
and then after all--oh, the awfulness of it!--had been replaced by an old pair, in the bustle
of departure.

The three girls stared at one another in consternation.  Here was a catastrophe to happen just
at the last moment, when everyone was so happy and well satisfied!  The dismay on the chubby
face was so pitiful that neither of Mellicent's companions could find it in her heart to speak
a word of reproof.  They rather set to work to propose different ways out of the difficulty.

"Get hold of Max, and coax him to go back for them!"

"He wouldn't; it's no use.  It's raining like anything, and it would take him an hour to go
there and come back."

"Ask Lady Darcy to send one of the servants--"

"No use, my dear.  They are scampering up and down like mice, and haven't a moment to spare
from their own work."

"See if Rosalind would lend me a pair!"

"Silly goose!  Look at your foot.  It is three times the size of hers. You will just have to
wear them, I'm afraid.  Give them to me, and let me see what can be done."  Peggy took the
slippers in her hands and studied them critically.  They were certainly not new, but then they
were by no means old; just respectable, middle-aged creatures, slightly rubbed on the heel
and white at the toes, but with many a day of good hard wear still before them.

"Oh, come," she said reassuringly, "they are not so bad, Mellicent! With a little polish they
would look quite presentable.  I'll tap at the door and ask Rosalind if she has some that she
can lend us.  She is sure to have it.  There are about fifty thousand bottles on her table."

Peggy crossed the room as she spoke, tapped on the panel, and received an immediate answer
in a high complacent treble.

"Coming!  Coming!  I'm weady;" then the door flew open; a tiny pink silk shoe stepped daintily
over the mat, and Rosalind stood before them in all the glory of a new Parisian dress.  Three
separate gasps of admiration greeted her appearance, and she stood smiling and dimpling while
the girls took in the fascinating details--the satin frock of palest imaginable pink, the white
chiffon over-dress which fell from shoulder to hem in graceful freedom, sprinkled over with
exquisite rose--leaves--it was all wonderful--fantastic--as far removed from Peggy's muslin
as from the homely crepon of the vicar's daughters.

"Rosalind! what a perfect angel you look!" gasped Mellicent, her own dilemma forgotten in her
wholehearted admiration; but the next moment memory came back, and her expression changed to
one of pitiful appeal. "But, oh, have you got any boot-polish?  The most awful thing has happened.
I've brought my old shoes by mistake!  Look!  I don't know what on earth I shall do, if you
can't give me something to black the toes."  She held out the shoes as she spoke, and Rosalind
gave a shrill scream of laughter.

"Oh! oh!  Those things!  How fwightfully funny! what a fwightful joke! You will look like Cinderwella,
when she wan away, and the glass slippers changed back to her dweadful old clogs.  It is too
scweamingly funny, I do declare!"

"Oh, never mind what you declare!  Can you lend us some boot-polish-- that's the question!"
cried Peggy sharply.  She knew Mellicent's horror of ridicule, and felt indignant with the
girl who could stand by, secure in her own beauty and elegance, and have no sympathy for the
misfortune of a friend.  "If you have a bottle of peerless gloss, or any of those shiny things
with a sponge fastened on the cork, I can make them look quite respectable, and no one will
have any cause to laugh."

"Ha, ha, ha!" trilled Rosalind once more, "Peggy is cwoss!  I never knew such a girl for flying
into tantwums at a moment's notice!  Yes, of course I'll lend you the polish.  There is some
in this little cupboard--there!  I won't touch it, in case it soils my gloves.  Shall I call
Marie to put it on for you?"

"Thank you, there's no need--I can do it!  I would rather do it myself!"

"Oh--oh, isn't she cwoss!  You will bweak the cork if you scwew it about like that, and then
you'll never be able to get it out.  Why don't you pull it pwoperly?"

"I know how to pull out a cork, thank you; I've done it before!"

Peggy shot an angry glance at her hostess, and set to work again with doubled energy.  Now
that Rosalind had laughed at her inability, it would be misery to fail; but the bottle had
evidently lain aside for some time, and a stiff black crust had formed round the cork which
made it difficult to move.  Peggy pulled and tugged, while Rosalind stood watching, laughing
her aggravating, patronising little laugh, and dropping a word of instruction from time to
time.  And then, quite suddenly, a dreadful thing happened.  In the flash of an eye--so quickly
and unexpectedly, that, looking back upon it, it seemed like a nightmare which could not possibly
have taken place in real life--the cork jerked out in Peggy's hand, in response to a savage
tug, and with it out flew an inky jet, which rose straight up in the air, separated into a
multitude of tiny drops, and descended in a flood--oh, the horror of that moment!--over Rosalind's
face, neck, and dress.

One moment a fairy princess, a goddess of summer, the next a figure of fun with black spots
scattered thickly over cheeks and nose, a big splash on the white shoulder, and inky daubs
dotted here and there between the rose-leaves.  What a transformation!  What a spectacle of
horror!  Peggy stood transfixed; Mellicent screamed in terror; and Esther ran forward, handkerchief
in hand, only to be waved aside with angry vehemence.  Rosalind's face was convulsed with anger;
she stamped her foot and spoke at the pitch of her voice, as if she had no control over her
feelings.

"Oh, oh, oh!  You wicked girl! you hateful, detestable girl!  You did it on purpose, because
you were in a temper!  You have been in a temper all the afternoon!  You have spoiled my dress!
I was weady to go downstairs.  It is eight o'clock.  In a few minutes everyone will be here,
and oh, what shall I do--what shall I do!  Whatever will mother say when she sees me?"

As if to give a practical answer to this inquiry, there came a sound of hasty footsteps in
the corridor, the door flew open, and Lady Darcy rushed in, followed by the French maid.

"My darling, what is it?  I heard your voice.  Has something happened? Oh-h!"  She stopped
short, paralysed with consternation, while the maid wrung her hands in despair.  "Rosalind,
what have you done to yourself?"

"Nothing, nothing!  It was Peggy Saville; she splashed me with her horrid boot-polish--I gave
it to her for her shoes.  It is on my face, my neck, in my mouth--"

"I was pulling the cork.  It came out with a jerk.  I didn't know; I didn't see!--"

Lady Darcy's face stiffened with an expression of icy displeasure.

"It is too annoying!  Your dress spoiled at the last moment! Inexcusable carelessness!  What
is to be done, Marie?  I am in despair!"

The Frenchwoman shrugged her shoulders with an indignant glance in Peggy's direction.

"There is nothing to do.  Put on another dress--that is all. Mademoiselle must change as quick
as she can.  If I sponge the spots, I spoil the whole thing at once."

"But you could cut them out, couldn't you?" cried Peggy, the picture of woe, yet miserably
eager to make what amends she could.  "You could cut out the spots with sharp scissors, and
the holes would not show, for the chiffon is so full and loose.  I--I think I could do it,
if you would let me try!"

Mistress and maid exchanged a sharp, mutual glance, and the Frenchwoman nodded slowly.

"Yes, it is true; I could rearrange the folds.  It will take some time, but still it can be
done.  It is the best plan."

"Go then, Rosalind, go with Marie; there is not a moment to spare, and for pity's sake don't
cry!  Your eyes will be red, and at any moment now the people may begin to arrive.  I wanted
you to be with me to receive your guests.  It will be most awkward being without you, but there
is no help for it, I suppose.  The whole thing is too annoying for words!"

Lady Darcy swept out of the room, and the three girls were once more left alone; but how changed
were their feelings in those few short moments!  There was not the shadow of a smile between
them; they looked more as if they were about to attend a funeral than a scene of festivity,
and for several moments no one had the heart to speak.  Peggy still held the fatal cork in
her hand, and went through the work of polishing Mellicent's slippers with an air of the profoundest
dejection. When they were finished she handed them over in dreary silence, and was recommencing
the brushing of her hair, when something in the expression of the chubby face arrested her
attention.  Her eyes flashed; she faced round with a frown and a quick, "Well, what is it?
What are you thinking now?"

"I--I wondered," whispered Mellicent breathlessly, "if you did do it on purpose!  Did you mean
to spoil her dress, and make her change it?"

Peggy's hands dropped to her side, her back straightened until she stood stiff and straight
as a poker.  Every atom of expression seemed to die out of her face.  Her voice had a deadly
quiet in its intonation.

"What do you think about it yourself?"

"I--I thought perhaps you did!  She teased you, and you were so cross. You seemed to be standing
so very near her, and you are jealous of her-- and she looked so lovely!  I thought perhaps
you did..."

"Mellicent Asplin," said Peggy quietly, and her voice was like the east wind that blows from
an icy-covered mountain,--"Mellicent Asplin, my name is Saville, and in my family we don't
condescend to mean and dishonourable tricks.  I may not like Rosalind, but I would have given
all I have in the world sooner than this should have happened.  I was trying to do you a service,
but you forget that.  You forget many things!  I have been jealous of Rosalind, because when
she arrived you and your sister forgot that I was alone and far-away from everyone belonging
to me, and were so much engrossed with her that you left me alone to amuse myself as best I
might.  You were pleased enough to have me when no one else was there, but you left me the
moment someone appeared who was richer and grander than I.  I wouldn't have treated you like
that, if our positions had been reversed.  If I dislike Rosalind, it is your fault as much
as hers; more than hers, for it was you who made me dread her coming!"

Peggy stopped, trembling and breathless.  There was a moment's silence in the room, and then
Esther spoke in a slow, meditative fashion.

"It is quite true!" she said.  "We have left you alone, Peggy; but it is not quite so bad as
you think.  Really and truly we like you far the best, but--but Rosalind is such a change to
us!  Everything about her is so beautiful and so different, that she has always seemed the
great excitement of our lives.  I don't know that I'm exactly fond of her, but I want to see
her, and talk to her, and hear her speak, and she is only here for a short time in the year.
It was because we looked upon you as really one of ourselves that we seemed to neglect you;
but it was wrong, all the same.  As for your spoiling her dress on purpose, it's ridiculous
to think of it.  How could you say such a thing, Mellicent, when Peggy was trying to help you,
too?  How could you be so mean and horrid?"

"Oh, well, I'm sure I wish I were dead!" wailed Mellicent promptly. "Nothing but fusses and
bothers, and just when I thought I was going to be so happy!  If I'd had white shoes, this
would never have happened. Always the same thing!  When you look forward to a treat, everything
is as piggy and nasty as it can be!  Wish I'd never come!  Wish I'd stayed at home, and let
the horrid old party go to Jericho!  Rosalind's crying, Peggy's cross, you are preaching! 
This is a nice way to enjoy yourself, I must say!"

Nothing is more hopeless than to reason with a placid person who has lapsed into a fit of ill-temper.
The two elder girls realised this, and remained perfectly silent while Mellicent continued
to wish for death, to lament the general misery of life, and the bad fortune which attended
the wearers of black slippers.  So incessant was the stream of her repinings, that it seemed
as if it might have gone on for ever, had not a servant entered at last, with the information
that the guests were beginning to arrive, and that Lady Darcy would be glad to see the young
ladies without delay.  Esther was anxious to wait and help Peggy with her toilet, but that
young lady was still on her dignity, and by no means anxious to descend to a scene of gaiety
for which she had little heart.  She refused the offer, therefore, in Mariquita fashion, and
the sisters walked dejectedly along the brightly-lit corridors, Mellicent still continuing
her melancholy wail, and Esther reflecting sadly that all was vanity, and devoutly wishing
herself back in the peaceful atmosphere of the vicarage.

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.

FIRE!

It was fully half an hour later when Peggy crept along the passage, and took advantage of a
quiet moment to slip into the room and seat herself in a sheltered corner.  Quick as she was,
however, somebody's eyes were even quicker, for a tall figure stepped before her, and an aggrieved
voice cried loudly--

"Well, I hope you are smart enough to satisfy yourself, now that you are ready!  You have taken
long enough, I must say.  What about that first waltz that you promised to have with me?"

Peggy drew in her breath with a gasp of dismay.

"Oh, Rob, I am sorry!  I forgot all about it.  I've been so perturbed. Something awful has
occurred.  You heard about it, of course--"

"No, I didn't?  What on earth," began the boy anxiously; but so soon as he heard the two words
"Rosalind's dress!" he shrugged his shoulders in contemptuous indifference.  "Oh, that!  I
heard something about it, but I didn't take much notice.  Spilt some ink, didn't you?  What's
the odds if you did?  Accidents will happen, and she has a dozen others to choose from.  I
don't see anything wrong with the dress.  It looks decent enough."

Peggy followed the direction of his eyes, and caught a glimpse of Rosalind floating past on
the arm of a tall soldierly youth.  She was sparkling with smiles, and looking as fresh and
spotless as on the moment when she had stepped across the threshold of her own room. Neither
face nor dress bore any trace of the misfortune of an hour before, and Peggy heaved a sigh
of relief as she watched her to and fro.

"Jolly enough, isn't she?  There's nothing for you to fret about, you see," said Rob consolingly.
"She has forgotten all about it, and the best thing you can do is to follow her example.  What
would you think of some light refreshment?  Let's go to the dining-room and drown our sorrows
in strawberry ice.  Then we can have a waltz, and try a vanilla--and a polka, and some lemonade!
That's, my idea of enjoying myself.  Come along, while you get the chance!--"

"Oh, Rob, you are greedy!" protested Peggy; nevertheless she rose blithely enough, and her
eyes began to sparkle with some of their wonted vivacity.  There was something strong and reassuring
about Robert's presence; he looked upon things in such an eminently sensible, matter-of-fact
way, that one was ashamed to give way to moods and tenses in his company.

Peggy began to feel that there was still some possibility of happiness in life, and on her
way to the door she came face to face with Lady Darcy, who reassured her still further by smiling
as amiably as if nothing had happened.

"Well, dear, enjoying yourself?  Got plenty of partners?"  Then in a whispered aside, "The
dress looks all right!  Such a clever suggestion of yours.  Dear, dear, what a fright we had!"
and she swept away, leaving an impression of beauty, grace, and affability which the girl was
powerless to resist.  When Lady Darcy chose to show herself at her best, there was a charm
about her which subjugated all hearts, and, from the moment that the sweet tired eyes smiled
into hers, Peggy Saville forgot her troubles and tripped away to eat strawberry ices, and dance
over the polished floor with a heart as light as her heels.

One party is very much like another.  The room may be larger or smaller, the supper more or
less substantial, but the programme is the same in both cases, and there is little to be told
about even the grandest of its kind.  Somebody wore pink; somebody wore blue; somebody fell
down on the floor in the middle of the lancers, which are no longer the stately and dignified
dance of yore, but an ungainly romp more befitting a kitchen than a ballroom; somebody went
in to supper twice over, and somebody never went at all, but blushed unseen in a corner, thinking
longingly of turkey, trifle, and crackers; and then the carriages began to roll up to the door,
brothers and sisters paired demurely together, stammered out a bashful "Enjoyed myself so much!
Thanks for a pleasant evening," and raced upstairs for coats and shawls.

By half-past twelve all the guests had departed except the vicarage party, and the sons and
daughters of the old squire who lived close by, who had been pressed to stay behind for that
last half-hour which is often the most enjoyable of the whole evening.

Lord and Lady Darcy and the grown-up visitors retired into the drawing-room to regale themselves
with sandwiches and ices, and the young people stormed the supper-room, interrupted the servants
in their work of clearing away the good things, seated themselves indiscriminately on floor,
chair, or table, and despatched a second supper with undiminished appetite.  Then Esther mounted
the platform where the band had been seated, and played a last waltz, and a very last waltz,
and "really the last waltz of all."  The squire's son played a polka with two fingers, and
a great deal of loud pedal, and the fun grew faster and more uproarious with every moment.
Even Rosalind threw aside young ladylike affectations and pranced about without thinking of
appearances, and when at last the others left the room to prepare for the drive home she seized
Peggy's arm in eager excitement.

"Peggy!  Peggy!  Such a joke!  I told them to come back to say good-bye, and I am going to
play a twick!  I'm going to be a ghost, and glide out from behind the shwubs, and fwighten
them.  I can do it beautifully. See!"  She turned down the gas as she spoke, threw her light
gauze skirt over her head, and came creeping across the room with stealthy tread, and arms
outstretched, while Peggy clapped her hands in delight.

"Lovely!  Lovely!  It looks exactly like wings.  It makes me quite creepy.  Don't come out
if Mellicent is alone, whatever you do.  She would be scared out of her seven senses.  Just
float gently along toward them, and keep your hands forward so as to hide your face.  They
will recognise you if you don't."

"Oh, if you can see my face, we must have less light.  There are too many candles, I'll put
out the ones on the mantelpiece.  Stay where you are, and tell me when it is wight," Rosalind
cried gaily, and ran across the room on her tiny pink silk slippers.

So long as she lived Peggy Saville remembered the next minutes; to the last day of her life
she had only to shut her eyes and the scene rose up before her, clear and vivid as in a picture.
The stretch of empty room, with its fragrant banks of flowers; the graceful figure flitting
across the floor, its outline swathed in folds of misty white; the glimpse of a lovely, laughing
face as Rosalind stretched out her arm to reach the silver candelabra, the sudden flare of
light which caught the robe of gauze, and swept it into flame.  It all happened within the
space of a minute, but it was one of those minutes the memory of which no years can destroy.
She had hardly time to realise the terror of the situation before Rosalind was rushing towards
her with outstretched hands, calling aloud in accents of frenzied appeal--

"Peggy!  Peggy!  Oh, save me, Peggy!  I'm burning!  Save me!  Save me!"

CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.

A NIGHT OF TERROR.

While the young folks had been enjoying themselves in the ballroom, their elders had found
the time hang somewhat heavily on their hands. The evening had not been so interesting to them
as to their juniors. Lady Darcy was tired with the preparations of the day, and the countess
with her journey from town.  Both were fain to yawn behind their fans from time to time, and
were longing for the moment to come when they could retire to bed.  If only those indefatigable
children would say good-night and take themselves off!  But the echo of the piano still sounded
from the room, and seemed to go on and on, in endless repetition.

Everything comes to those who wait, however--even the conclusion of a ball to the weary chaperon.
At long past midnight the strains died away, and in the hope of an early release the ladies
roused themselves to fresh conversational effort.  What they said was unimportant, and could
never be remembered; but at one moment, as it seemed, they were smiling and exchanging their
little commonplace amenities, two languid, fine ladies whose aim in life might have been to
disguise their own feelings and hide the hearts that God had given them; the next the artificial
smiles were wiped away, and they were clinging together, two terrified, cowering women, with
a mother's soul in their faces--a mother's love and fear and dread!  A piercing cry had sounded
through the stillness, and another, and another, and, while they sat paralysed with fear, footsteps
came tearing along the passage, the door was burst open, and a wild, dishevelled-looking figure
rushed into the room.  A curtain was wound round face and figure, but beneath its folds a long
white arm gripped convulsively at the air, and two little feet staggered about in pink silk
slippers.

Lady Darcy gave a cry of anguish; but her terror seemed to hold her rooted to the spot, and
it was her husband who darted forward and caught the swaying figure in his arms.  The heavy
wrappings came loose in his grasp, and as they did so an unmistakable smell pervaded the room--the
smell of singed and burning clothing.  A cloud of blackened rags fluttered to the ground as
the last fold of the curtain was unloosed, and among them--most pitiful sight of all--were
stray gleams of gold where a severed lock of hair lay on the carpet, its end still turned in
glistening curl.

"Rosalind!  Rosalind!" gasped the poor mother, clutching the arms of her chair, and looking
as if she were about to faint herself, as she gazed upon the pitiful figure of her child. 
The lower portion of Rosalind's dress was practically uninjured, but the gauze skirt and all
the frills and puffing round the neck hung in tatters, her hair was singed and roughened, and
as the air touched her skin she screamed with pain, and held her hands up to her neck and face.

"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I am burning!  Cover me up!  Cover me up!  I shall die! Oh, mother, mother!
The pain--the pain!"

She reeled as if about to faint, yet if anyone attempted to approach she beat them off with
frantic hands, as if in terror of being touched.

One of the ladies ran forward with a shawl, and wrapped it forcibly round the poor scarred
shoulders, while the gentlemen hurried out of the room to send for a doctor and make necessary
arrangements.  One of the number came back almost immediately, with the news that he had failed
to discover the cause of the accident.  There was no sign of fire upstairs, the ballroom was
dark and deserted, the servants engaged in setting the entertaining rooms in order.  For the
present, at least, the cause of the accident remained a mystery, and the distracted father
and mother occupied themselves in trying to pacify their child.

"I'll carry you upstairs, my darling.  We will put something on your skin which will take away
the pain.  Try to be quiet, and tell us how it happened.  What were you doing to set yourself
on fire?"

"Peggy!  Peggy!" gasped Rosalind faintly.  Her strength was failing by this time, and she could
hardly speak; but Lady Darcy's face stiffened into an awful anger at the sound of that name.
She turned like a tigress to her husband, her face quivering with anger.

"That girl again!  That wicked girl!  It is the second time to-night! She has killed the child;
but she shall be punished!  I'll have her punished!  She shall not kill my child, and go free!
I'll--I'll--"

"Hush, hush, Beatrice!  Take care!  You frighten Rosalind.  We must get her to bed.  There
is not a moment to lose."

Lord Darcy beckoned to one of the servants, who by this time were crowding in at the door,
and between them they lifted poor, groaning Rosalind in their arms, and carried her up the
staircase, down which she had tripped so gaily a few hours before.  Tenderly as they held her,
she moaned with every movement, and, when she was laid on her bed, it seemed for a moment as
if consciousness were about to forsake her.  Then suddenly a light sprung into her eyes.  She
lifted her hand and gasped out one word--just one word--repeated over and over again in a tone
of agonised entreaty.

"Peggy!  Peggy!  Peggy!"

"Yes, darling, yes!  I'll go to her.  Be quiet--only be quiet!"

Lady Darcy turned away with a shudder as the maid and an old family servant began the task
of removing the clothes from Rosalind's writhing limbs, and, seizing her husband by the arm,
drew him out on the landing. Her face was white, but her eyes gleamed, and the words hissed
as they fell from her lips.

"Find that girl, and turn her out of this house!  I will not have her here another hour!  Do
you hear--not a minute!  Send her away at once before I see her!  Don't let me see her!  I
can't be responsible for what I would do!"

"Yes, yes, dear, I'll send her away!  Try to calm yourself.  Remember you have work to do Rosalind
will need you."

The poor old lord went stooping away, his tired face looking aged and haggard with anxiety.
His beautiful young daughter was scarcely less dear to him than to her mother, and the sound
of her cries cut to his heart; yet in the midst of his anguish he had a pang of compassion
for the poor child who, as he believed, was the thoughtless cause of the accident.  What agony
of remorse must be hers!  What torture she would now be suffering!

The guests and servants were standing huddled together on the landing upstairs, or running
to and fro to procure what was needed.  Every thought was concentrated on Rosalind, and Rosalind
alone, and the part of the house where the dance had been held was absolutely deserted.

He took his way along the gaily decorated hall, noted with absent eye the disordered condition
of the "harem," which had been pointed out so proudly at the beginning of the evening, and
entered the empty room. The lights were out, except for a few candles scattered here and there
among the flowers.  He walked slowly forward, saw the silver candlestick on the floor before
the fireplace, and stood gazing at it with a quick appreciation of what had happened.  For
some reason or other Rosalind had tried to reach the candle, and the light had caught her gauzy
skirt, which had burst into flames.  It was easy--terribly easy to imagine; but in what way
had Peggy Saville been responsible for the accident, so that her name should sound so persistently
on Rosalind's lips,--and who had been the Good Samaritan who had come to the rescue with that
thick curtain which had killed the flames before they had time to finish the work of destruction?

Lord Darcy peered curiously round.  The oak floor stretched before him dark and still, save
where its polished surface reflected the light overhead; but surely in the corner opposite
to where he stood there was a darker mass--a shadow deeper than the rest?

He walked towards it, bending forward with straining eyes.  Another curtain of the same pattern
as that which had enveloped Rosalind--a curtain of rich Oriental hues with an unaccountable
patch of white in the centre.  What was it?  It must be part of the fabric itself.  Lord Darcy
told himself that he had no doubt on the subject, yet the way across the room seemed unaccountably
long, and his heart beat fast with apprehension.  In another moment he stood in the corner,
and knew too well the meaning of that patch of white, for Peggy Saville lay stretched upon
the curtain, motionless, unconscious--to all appearance, dead!

CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.

THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW.

It was one o'clock in the morning when a carriage drove up to the door of the Larches, and
Mrs Asplin alighted, all pale, tear-stained, and tremulous.  She had been nodding over the
fire in her bedroom when the young people had returned with the news of the tragic ending to
the night's festivity, and no persuasion or argument could induce her to wait until the next
day before flying to Peggy's side.

"No, no!" she cried.  "You must not hinder me.  If I can't drive, I will walk!  I would go
to the child to-night, if I had to crawl on my hands and knees!  I promised her mother to look
after her.  How could I stay at home and think of her lying there?  Oh, children, children,
pray for Peggy!  Pray that she may be spared, and that her poor parents may be spared this
awful--awful news!"

Then she kissed her own girls, clasped them to her in a passionate embrace, and drove off to
the Larches in the carriage which had brought the young people home.

Lady Darcy came out to meet her, and gripped her hand in welcome.

"You have come!  I knew you would.  I am so thankful to see you.  The doctor has come, and
will stay all night.  He has sent for a nurse--"

"And--my Peggy?"

Lady Darcy's lips quivered.

"Very, very ill--much worse than Rosalind!  Her poor little arms!  I was so wicked, I thought
it was her fault, and I had no pity, and now it seems that she has saved my darling's life.
They can't tell us about it yet, but it was she who wrapped the curtain round Rosalind, and
burned herself in pressing out the flames.  Rosalind kept crying, `Peggy! Peggy!' and we thought
she meant that it was Peggy's fault.  We had heard so much of her mischievous tricks.  My husband
found her lying on the floor.  She was unconscious; but she came round when they were dressing
her arms.  I think she will know you--"

"Take me to her, please!"  Mrs Asplin said quickly.  She had to wait several moments before
she could control her voice sufficiently to add, "And Rosalind, how is she?"

"There is no danger.  Her neck is scarred, and her hair singed and burned.  She is suffering
from the shock, but the doctor says it is not serious.  Peggy--"

She paused, and the other walked on resolutely, not daring to ask for the termination of that
sentence.  She crept into the little room, bent over the bed, and looked down on Peggy's face
through a mist of tears. It was drawn and haggard with pain, and the eyes met hers without
a ray of light in their hollow depths.  That she recognised was evident, but the pain which
she was suffering was too intense to leave room for any other feeling.  She lay motionless,
with her bandaged arms stretched before her, and her face looked so small and white against
the pillow that Mrs Asplin trembled to think how little strength was there to fight against
the terrible shock and strain.  Only once in all that long night did Peggy show any consciousness
of her surroundings, but then her eyes lit up with a gleam of remembrance, her lips moved,
and Mrs Asplin bent down to catch the faintly whispered words--

"The twenty-sixth--next Monday!  Don't tell Arthur!"

"`The twenty-sixth!'  What is that, darling?  Ah, I remember--Arthur's examination!  You mean
if he knew you were ill, it would upset him for his work?"

An infinitesimal movement of the head answered "Yes," and she gave the promise in trembling tones--

"No, my precious, we won't tell him.  He could not help, and it would only distress you to
feel that he was upset.  Don't trouble about it, darling.  It will be all right."

Then Peggy shut her eyes and wandered away into a strange world, in which accustomed things
disappeared, and time was not, and nothing remained but pain and weariness and mystery.  Those
of us who have come near to death have visited this world too, and know the blackness of it,
and the weary waking.

Peggy lay in her little white bed, and heard voices speaking in her ear, and saw strange shapes
flit to and fro.  Quite suddenly, as it appeared, a face would be bending over her own, and
as she watched it with languid curiosity, wondering what manner of thing it could be, it would
melt away and vanish in the distance.  At other times again it would grow larger and larger,
until it assumed gigantic proportions, and she cried out in fear of the huge, saucer-like eyes.
There was a weary puzzle in her brain, an effort to understand, but everything seemed mixed
up and incomprehensible.  She would look round the room and see the sunshine peeping in through
the chinks of the blinds, and when she closed her eyes for a moment--just a single fleeting
moment--lo! the gas was lit, and someone was nodding in a chair by her side.  And it was by
no means always the same room.  She was tired, and wanted badly to rest, yet she was always
rushing about here, there, and everywhere, striving vainly to dress herself in clothes which
fell off as soon as they were fastened, hurrying to catch a train to reach a certain destination;
but in each instance the end was the same--she was falling, falling, falling--always falling--from
the crag of an Alpine precipice, from the pinnacle of a tower, from the top of a flight of
stairs.  The slip and the terror pursued her wherever she went; she would shriek aloud, and
feel soft hands pressed on her cheeks, soft voices murmuring in her ear.

One vision stood out plainly from those nightmare dreams--the vision of a face which suddenly
appeared in the midst of the big grey cloud which enveloped her on every side--a beautiful
face which was strangely like, and yet unlike, something she had seen long, long ago in a world
which she had well-nigh forgotten.  It was pale and thin, and the golden hair fell in a short
curly crop on the blue garment which was swathed over the shoulders.  It was like one of the
heads of celestial choir-boys which she had seen on Christmas cards and in books of engravings,
yet something about the eyes and mouth seemed familiar.  She stared at it curiously, and then
suddenly a strange, weak little voice faltered out a well-known name.

"Rosalind!" it cried, and a quick exclamation of joy sounded from the side of the bed.  Who
had spoken?  The first voice had been strangely like her own, but at an immeasurable distance.
She shut her eyes to think about it, and the fair-haired vision disappeared, and was seen no more.

There was a big, bearded man also who came in from time to time, and Peggy grew to dread his
appearance, for with it came terrible stabbing pain, as if her whole body were on the rack.
He was one of the Spanish Inquisitors, of whom she had read, and she was an English prisoner
whom he was torturing!  Well, he might do his worst!  She would die before she would turn traitor
and betray her flag and country.  The Savilles were a fighting race, and would a thousand times
rather face death than dishonour.

One day, when she felt rather stronger than usual, she told him so to his face, and he laughed--she
was quite sure he laughed, the hard-hearted wretch!  And someone else said, "Poor little love!"
which was surely an extraordinary expression for a Spanish Inquisitor.  That was one of the
annoying things in this new life--people were so exceedingly stupid in their conversation!
Now and again she herself had something which she was especially anxious to say, and when she
set it forth with infinite difficulty and pains the only answer which she received was a soothing,
"Yes, dear, yes!"

"No, dear, no!" or a still more maddening, "Yes, darling, I quite understand!"--which she knew
perfectly well to be an untruth.  Really, these good people seemed to think that she was demented,
and did not know what she was saying.  As a matter of fact, it was exactly the other way about;
but she was too tired to argue.  And then one day came a sleep when she neither dreamt nor
slipped nor fell, but opened her eyes refreshed and cheerful, and beheld Mrs Asplin sitting
by a table drinking tea and eating what appeared to be a particularly tempting slice of cake.

"I want some cake!" she said clearly; and Mrs Asplin jumped as if a cannon had been fired off
at her ear, and rushed breathlessly to the bedside, stuttering and stammering in amazement--

"Wh-wh-wh-what?"

"Cake!" repeated Peggy shrilly.  "I want some!  And tea!  I want my tea!"

Surely it was a very natural request!  What else could you expect from a girl who had been
asleep and wakened up feeling hungry?  What on earth was there in those commonplace words to
make a grown-up woman cry like a baby, and why need everyone in the house rush in and stare
at her as if she were a figure in a waxwork?  Lord Darcy, Lady Darcy, Rosalind, the old French
maid--they were all there--and, as sure as her name was Peggy Saville, they were all four,
handkerchief in hand, mopping their eyes like so many marionettes!

Nobody gave her the cake for which she had asked.  Peggy considered it exceedingly rude and
ill-bred; but while she was thinking of it she grew tired again, and, rolling round into a
soft little bundle among the blankets, fell afresh into sweet refreshing slumbers.

CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.

CONVALESCENCE.

"Convalescence," remarked Peggy elegantly, a week later on, "convalescence is a period not
devoid of attraction!"  She was lying on a sofa in her bedroom at the Larches, wrapped in her
white dressing-gown, and leaning against a nest of pink silk cushions, and, what with a table
drawn up by her side laden with grapes and jelly, a pile of Christmas numbers lying close at
hand, and the presence of an audience consisting of Rosalind, Lady Darcy, and Mrs Asplin, ready
to listen admiringly to her conversation, and to agree enthusiastically with every word she
uttered, it did indeed seem as if the position was one which might be endured with fortitude!
Many were the questions which had been showered upon her since her return to consciousness,
and the listeners never grew tired of listening to her account of the accident.  How Rosalind
had clutched too carelessly at the slender candlestick, so that it had fallen forward, setting
the gauze dress in flames, how she herself had flown out of the room, torn down the curtains
which draped the "harem," and had flung them round the frantic, struggling figure.  With every
day that passed, however, Peggy gained more strength, and was petted to her heart's content
by everyone in the house.  The old lord kissed her fondly on the cheek, and murmured, "God
reward you, my brave girl, for I never can."  Lady Darcy shed tears every morning when the
burns were dressed, and said, "Oh, Peggy dear, forgive me for being cross, and do, do be sure
to use the lotion for your arms regularly every day when you get better!"  And the big doctor
chucked her under the chin, and cried--

"Well, `Fighting Saville,' and how are we to-day?  You are the pluckiest little patient I've
had for a long time.  I'll say that for you!  Let's have another taste of the rack!"  It was
all most agreeable and soothing to one's feelings!

One of the first questions Peggy asked after her return to consciousness was as to how much
her father and mother had been told of her accident, and whether the news had been sent by
letter or cable.

"By letter, dear," Mrs Asplin replied.  "We talked it over carefully, and concluded that that
would be best.  You know, dearie, we were very, very anxious about you for a few days, but
the doctor said that it would be useless cabling to your mother, because if all went well you
would be up again before she could arrive, and if--if it had gone the other way, Peggy, she
could not have been in time.  I sent her a long letter, and I have written every mail since,
and now we are going to calculate the time when the first letter will arrive, and send a cable
to say that you are quite out of danger, and sitting up, and getting hungrier and more mischievous
with every day as it passes!"

"Thank you," said Peggy warmly.  "That's very kind.  I am glad you thought of that; but will
you please promise not to be economical about the cable?  They won't care about the money.
Spend pounds over it if it is necessary, but do, do manage to make them believe that I am quite
perky.  Put at the end, `Peggy says she is perky!'  They will know that is genuine, and it
will convince them more than anything else."  And so those five expressive words went flashing
across the world at the end of a long message, and brought comfort to two hearts that had been
near to breaking.

So soon as Peggy was pronounced to be out of danger, Mrs Asplin went back to the vicarage,
leaving her in the charge of the kind hospital nurse, though for that matter every member of
the household took it in turns to wait upon her.  A dozen times a day the master and mistress
of the house would come into the sick-room to inquire how things were going, or to bring some
little gift for the invalid; and as she grew stronger it became the custom for father, mother,
and daughter to join her at her early tea.  Peggy watched them from her sofa, too weak to speak
much, but keenly alive to all that was going on, among other things, to the change which had
come over these three persons since she had known them first.  Lord Darcy had always been kind
and considerate, but his manner seemed gentler and more courteous than ever, while Rosalind's
amiability was an hourly surprise, and Lady Darcy's manner had lost much of its snappish discontent.
On one occasion, when her husband made some little request, she replied in a tone so sweet
and loving that the listener started with surprise.  What could it be that had worked this
transformation?  She did not realise that when the Angel of Death has hovered over a household,
and has at last flown away with empty arms, leaving the home untouched, they would be hard
hearts that were not touched, ungrateful natures that did not take thought of themselves, and
face life with a higher outlook!  Lady Darcy's social disappointments seemed light compared
with the awful "might have been"; while Rosalind's lamentations over her disfigurement had
died away at the sight of Peggy's unconscious form.  Perhaps, when Lord Darcy thanked Peggy
for all she had done for him and his, he had other thoughts in his mind than the mere physical
deliverance of which she had been the instrument!

Arthur had been kept well informed of his sister's recovery, and proved himself the kindest
of brothers, sending letters by the dozen, full of such nonsensical jokes, anecdotes, and illustrations,
as would have cheered the gloomiest invalid in the world.  But the happiest day of all was
when the great news arrived that his name was placed first of all in the list of successful
candidates.  This was indeed tidings of comfort and joy!  Peggy clapped her bandaged hands
together, and laughed aloud with tears of pain streaming down her face.  "Arthur Saville, V.C.,
Arthur Saville, V.C.!" she cried, and then fell to groaning because some days must still elapse
before the medical examination was over, and her hero was set free to hasten to her side.

"And I shall be back at the vicarage then, and we shall all be together! Oh, let us be joyful!
How happy I am!  What a nice old world it is, after all!" she continued hilariously, while
Rosalind gazed at her with reproachful eyes.

"Are you so glad to go away?  I shall be vewy, vewy sowwy--I'll miss you awfully.  I shall
feel that there is nothing to do when you have gone away, Peggy!"--Rosalind hesitated, and
looked at her companion in uncertain bashful fashion.  "I--I think you like me a little bit
now, and I'm vewy fond of you, but you couldn't bear me before we were ill. You might tell me why?"

"I was jealous of you," said Peggy promptly; whereat Rosalind's eyes filled with tears.

"You won't be jealous now!" she said dismally, and raised her head to stare at her own reflection
in the mirror.  The hair which had once streamed below her waist was now cut short round her
head, her face had lost its delicate bloom, and an ugly scar disfigured her throat and the
lower portion of one cheek.  Beautiful she must always be, with her faultless features and
wonderful eyes, but the bloom and radiance of colour which had been her chief charm had disappeared
for the time being as completely as though they had never existed.

"I'll love you more," said Peggy reassuringly.  "You are ever so much nicer, and you will be
as pretty as ever when your hair grows and the marks fade away.  I like you better when you
are not quite so pretty, for you really were disgustingly conceited; weren't you now?  You
can't deny it."

"Oh, Peggy Saville, and so were you!  I saw that the first moment you came into the woom. 
You flared up like a Turkey cock if anyone dared to offend your dignity, and you were always
widing about on your high horse, tossing your head, and using gweat long words."

"That's pride, it's not conceit.  It's quite a different thing."

"It's about the same to other people," said Rosalind shrewdly.  "We both gave ourselves airs,
and the wesult was the same, whatever caused it.  I was pwoud of my face, and you were pwoud
of your--your--er--family--and your cleverness, and--the twicks you played; so if I confess,
you ought to confess too.  I'm sorry I aggwavated you, Mawiquita, and took all the pwaise for
the decowations.  It was howwibly mean, and I don't wonder you were angwy.  I'm sorry that
I was selfish!"

"I exceedingly regret that I formed a false estimate of your character! Let's be chums!" said
Peggy sweetly; and the two girls eyed one another uncertainly for a moment, then bent forward
and exchanged a kiss of conciliation, after which unusual display of emotion they were seized
with instant embarrassment.

"Hem!" said Peggy.  "It's very cold!  Fire rather low, I think.  Looks as if it were going
to snow."

"No," said Rosalind; "I mean--yes.  I'll put on some more--I mean coals. In half an hour Esther
and Mellicent will be here--"

"Oh, so they will!  How lovely!"  Peggy seized gladly on the new opening, and proceeded to
enlarge on the joy which she felt at the prospect of seeing her friends again, for on that
afternoon Robert and the vicarage party were to be allowed to see her for the first time, and
to have tea in her room.  She had been looking forward to their visit for days, and, new that
the longed-for hour was at hand, she was eager to have the lamps lit, and all preparations
made for their arrival.

Robert appeared first, having ridden over in advance of the rest.  And Rosalind, after going
out to greet him, came rushing back, all shaken with laughter, with the information that he
had begun to walk on tiptoe the moment that he had left the drawing-room, and was creeping
along the passage as if terrified at making a sound.

Peggy craned her head, heard the squeak, squeak of boots coming nearer and nearer, the cautious
opening of the door, the heavy breaths of anxiety, and then, crash!--bang!--crash! down flopped
the heavy screen round the doorway, and Rob was discovered standing among the ruins in agonies
of embarrassment.  From his expression of despair, he might have supposed that the shock would
kill Peggy outright; but she gulped down her nervousness, and tried her best to reassure him.

"Oh, never mind--never mind!  It doesn't matter.  Come over here and talk to me.  Oh, Rob,
Rob, I am so glad to see you!"

Robert stood looking down in silence, while his lips twitched and his eyebrows worked in curious
fashion.  If it had not been altogether too ridiculous, Peggy would have thought that he felt
inclined to cry.  But he only grunted, and cried--

"What a face!  You had better tuck into as much food as you can, and get some flesh on your
bones.  It's about as big as the palm of my hand! Never saw such a thing in my life."

"Never mind my face," piped Peggy in her weak little treble.  "Sit right down and talk to me.
What is the news in the giddy world?  Have you heard anything about the prize?  When does the
result come out? Remember you promised faithfully not to open the paper until we were together.
I was so afraid it would come while I was too ill to look at it!"

"I should have waited," said Robert sturdily.  "There would have been no interest in the thing
without you; but the result won't be given for ten days yet, and by that time you will be with
us again.  The world hasn't been at all giddy, I can tell you.  I never put in a flatter time.
Everybody was in the blues, and the house was like a tomb, and a jolly uncomfortable tomb at
that.  Esther was housekeeper while Mrs Asplin was away, and she starved us!  She was in such
a mortal fright of being extravagant that she could scarcely give us enough to keep body and
soul together, and the things we had were not fit to eat.  Nothing but milk puddings and stewed
fruit for a week on end.  Then we rebelled.  I nipped her up in my arms one evening in the
schoolroom, and stuck her on the top of the little bookcase.  Then we mounted guard around,
and set forth our views.  It would have killed you to see her perched up there, trying to look
prim and to keep up her dignity.

"`Let me down this moment, Robert.  Bring a chair and let me get down.'

"`Will you promise to give us a pie to-morrow, then, and a decent sort of a pudding?'

"`It's no business of yours what I give you.  You ought to be thankful for good wholesome food!'

"`Milk puddings are not wholesome.  They don't agree with us--they are too rich!  We should
like something a little lighter for a change.  Will you swear off milk puddings for the next
fortnight if I let you down?'

"`You are a cruel, heartless fellow, Robert Darcy--thinking of puddings when Peggy is ill,
and we are all so anxious about her!'

"`Peggy would die at once if she heard how badly you were treating us. Now then, you have kept
me waiting for ten minutes, so the price has gone up.  Now you'll have to promise a pair of
ducks and mince-pies into the bargain!  I shall be ashamed of meeting a sheep soon, if we go
on eating mutton every day of the week.'

"`Call yourself a gentleman!' says she, tossing her head and withering me with a glance of scorn.

"`I call myself a hungry man, and that's all we are concerned about for the moment,' said I.
`A couple of ducks and two nailing good puddings to-morrow night, or there you sit for the
rest of the evening!'

"We went at it hammer and tongs until she was fairly spluttering with rage; but she had to
promise before she came down, and we had no more starvation diet after that.  Oswald went up
to town for a day, and bought a pair of blue silk socks and a tie to match--that's the greatest
excitement we have had.  The rest has been all worry and grind, and Mellicent on the rampage
about Christmas presents.  Oh, by the bye, I printed those photographs you wanted to send to
your mother, and packed them off by the mail a fortnight ago, so that she would get them in
good time for Christmas."

"Rob, you didn't!  How noble of you!  You really are an admirable person!"  Peggy lay back
against her pillows and gazed at her "partner" in great contentment of spirit.  After living
an invalid's life for these past weeks, it was delightfully refreshing to look at the big strong
face.  The sight of it was like a fresh breeze coming into the close, heated room, and she
felt as if some of his superabundant energy had come into her own weak frame.

A little later the vicarage party arrived, and greeted the two convalescents with warmest affection.
If they were shocked at the sight of Rosalind's disfigurement and Peggy's emaciation, three
out of the four were polite enough to disguise their feelings; but it was too much to expect
of Mellicent that she should disguise what she happened to be feeling.  She stared and gaped,
and stared again, stuttering with consternation--

"Why--why--Rosalind--your hair!  It's shorter than mine!  It doesn't come down to your shoulders!
Did they cut it all off?  What did you do with the rest?  And your poor cheek!  Will you have
that mark all your life?"

"I don't know.  Mother is going to twy electwicity for it.  It will fade a good deal, I suppose,
but I shall always be a fwight.  I'm twying to wesign myself to be a hideous monster!" sighed
Rosalind, turning her head towards the window the while in such a position that the scar was
hidden from view, and she looked more like the celestial choir-boy of Peggy's delirium than
ever, with the golden locks curling round her neck, and the big eyes raised to the ceiling
in a glance of pathetic resignation.

Rob guffawed aloud with the callousness of a brother; but the other two lads gazed at her with
an adoring admiration which was balm to her vain little heart.  Vain still, for a nature does
not change in a day; and, though Rosalind was an infinitely more lovable person now than she
had been a few weeks before, the habits of a lifetime were still strong upon her, and she could
never by any possibility be indifferent to admiration, or pass a mirror without stopping to
examine the progress of that disfiguring scar.

"It wouldn't have mattered half so much if it had been Peggy's face that was spoiled," continued
Mellicent, with cruel outspokenness, "and it is only her hands that are hurt.  Things always
go the wrong way in this world!  I never saw anything like it.  You know that night-dress bag
I was working for mother, Peggy?  Well, I only got two skeins of the blue silk, and then if
I didn't run short, and they hadn't any more in the shop.  The other shades don't match at

"That's not Arthur!" cried Mrs Asplin confidently.  "He knocks straight on without stopping,
peals the bell at the same time, and shouts Christmas carols through the letter-box!  He has
sent on his luggage, I expect, and is going to pounce in upon us later on."

"Ah, no, that's not Arthur!" assented Peggy; but Mr Asplin turned his head quickly towards
the door, as if his ear had caught a familiar note, hesitated for a moment, and then walked
quickly into the hall.

"My dear boy!" the listeners heard him cry; and then another voice spoke in reply--Arthur's
voice--saying, "How do you do, sir?" in such flat, subdued tones as filled them with amazement.

Mrs Asplin and Peggy turned towards each other with distended eyes.  If Arthur had suddenly
slid down the chimney and crawled out on the hearth before them, turned a somersault in at
the window, or crawled from beneath the table, it would have caused no astonishment whatever;
but that he should ring at the bell, walk quietly into the hall, and wait to hang up his hat
like any other ordinary mortal,--this was indeed an unprecedented and extraordinary proceeding!
The same explanation darted into both minds.  His sister's illness!  He was afraid of startling
an invalid, and was curbing his overflowing spirits in consideration for her weakness.

Peggy rose from her chair, and stood waiting, with sparkling eyes and burning cheeks.  He should
see in one glance that she was better--almost well--that there was no need of anxiety on her
behalf.  And then the tall, handsome figure appeared in the doorway, and Arthur's voice cried--

"Peggikens!  Up and dressed!  This is better than I hoped.  How are you, dear little Peg?"

There was something wrong with the voice, something lacking in the smile; but his sister was
too excited to notice it.  She stretched out her arms towards him, and raised her weak, quavering
little voice in a song of triumph--

"See-ee the conquering he-he-he-he-hero com-ums!  Sow-ow-ow-ow-ownd the trumpet, play--a--a--a--"

"Don't, Peg!" cried Arthur sharply.  "Don't, dear!"  He was standing by her side by this time,
and suddenly he wrapped his arms round her and laid his curly head on hers.  "I'm plucked,
Peg!" he cried, and his voice was full of tears.  "Oh, Peg, I'm plucked!  It's all over; I
can never be a soldier.  I'm plucked--plucked--plucked!"

"Arthur dear!  Arthur darling!" cried Peggy loudly.  She clasped her arms round his neck, and
glared over his shoulder, like a tigress whose young has been threatened with danger.  "You
plucked!  My brother plucked!  Ho! ho! ho!"  She gave a shrill peal of laughter.  "It's impossible!
You were first of all, the very first.  You always are first.  Who was wicked enough, and cruel
enough, and false enough, to say that Arthur Saville was plucked in an examination?"

"Arthur, my boy, what is it?  What does it mean?  You told us you were first.  How can you
possibly be plucked?"

"My--my eyes!" said Arthur faintly.  He raised his head from Peggy's shoulder and looked round
with a haggard smile.  "The medical exam. They would not pass me.  I was rather blind when
I was here before, but I thought it was with reading too much.  I never suspected there was
anything really wrong--never for a moment!"

"Your eyes!"  The vicar pressed his hand to his forehead, as if unable to grasp this sudden
shattering of his hopes.  "But--but I don't understand!  Your eyes never gave you any trouble
when you were here. You were not short-sighted.  One knew, of course, that good sight was necessary;
but there seemed no weakness in that direction.  I can't imagine any cause that can have brought
it on."

"I can!" said Arthur drearily.  "I got a bad knock at lacrosse two years ago.  I didn't tell
you about it, for it wasn't worth while; but my eyes were bad for some time after that.  I
thought they were all right again; but I had to read a lot of things across a room, and made
a poor show of it.  Then the doctor took me to a window and pointed to an omnibus that was passing.

"`What's the name on that 'bus?' he said.  `What is the colour of that woman's hat?  How many
horses are there?'

"I guessed.  I couldn't see.  I made a shot at it, and it was a wrong shot.  He was a kind
old chap.  I think he was sorry for me.  I--I came out into the street, and walked about. 
It was very cold.  I tried to write to you, but I couldn't do it--I couldn't put it down in
black and white.  No V.C. now, little Peg!  That's all over.  You will have a civilian for
your brother, after all!"

He bent down to kiss the girl's cheeks as he spoke, and she threw her arms round his neck and
kissed him passionately upon his closed eyelids.

"Dear eyes!" she cried impetuously.  "Oh, dear eyes!  They are the dearest eyes in all the
world, whatever anyone says about them.  It doesn't matter what you are--you are my Arthur,
the best and cleverest brother in all the world.  Nobody is like you!"

"You have a fine career before you still, my boy!  You will always fight, I hope, and conquer
enemies even more powerful than armed men!" cried Mrs Asplin, trembling.  "There are more ways
than one of being a soldier, Arthur!"

"I know it, mater," said the young man softly.  He straightened his back and stood in silence,
his head thrown back, his eyes shining with emotion, as fine a specimen of a young English
gentleman as one could wish to meet.  "I know it," he repeated, and Mrs Asplin turned aside
to hide her tears.  "Oh, my pretty boy!" she was saying to herself.  "Oh, my pretty boy!  And
I'll never see him in his red coat, riding his horse like a prince among them all!  I'll never
see the medals on his breast! Oh, my poor lad that has the fighting blood in his veins!  It's
like tearing the heart out of him to turn Arthur Saville into anything but a soldier.  And
the poor father--what will he say at all, when he hears this terrible news?"  She dared not
trust herself to speak again; the others were too much stunned and distressed to make any attempt
at consolation, and it was a relief to all when Mellicent's calm, matter-of-fact treble broke
the silence.

"Well, for my part, I'm very glad!" she announced slowly.  "I'm sorry, of course, if he has
to wear spectacles, because they are not becoming, but I'm glad he is not going to be a soldier.
I think it's silly having nothing to do but drill in barracks, and pretending to fight when
there is no one to fight with.  I should hate to be a soldier in times of peace, and it would
be fifty thousand times worse in war.  Oh, my goodness, shouldn't I be in a fright!  I should
run away--I know I should; but Arthur would be in the front of every battle, and it's absurd
to think that he would not get killed.  You know what Arthur is! Did you ever know him have
a chance of hurting himself and not taking it?  He would be killed in the very first battle--that's
my belief--and then you would be sorry that you wanted him to be a soldier!  Or, if he wasn't
killed, he would have his legs shot off.  Last time I was in London I saw a man with no legs.
He was sitting on a little board with wheels on it, and selling matches in the street.  Well,
I must say I'd rather have my brother a civilian, as you call it, than have no legs, or be
cut in pieces by a lot of nasty naked old savages."

A general smile went round the company.  There was no resisting it. Even Arthur's face brightened,
and he turned his head and looked at Mellicent with his old twinkling smile.

"Bravo, Chubby!" he cried.  "Bravo, Chubby!  Commend me to Mellicent for good, sound commonsense.
The prospect of squatting on a board, selling matches, is not exhilarating, I must confess.
I'm glad there is one person at least who thinks my prospects are improved."  He gave a little
sigh, which was stifled with praiseworthy quickness.  "Well, the worst is over, now that I
have told you and written the letter to India. Those were the two things that I dreaded most.
Now I shall just have to face life afresh, and see what can be made of it.  I must have a talk
with you, sir, later on, and get your advice.  Cheer up, Peggikens! Cheer up, mater!  It's
no use grieving over spilt milk, and Christmas is coming.  It would never do to be in the dolefuls
over Christmas!  I've got a boxful of presents upstairs--amused myself with buying them yesterday
to pass the time.  You come up with me to-night, Peg, and I'll give you a peep.  You look better
than I expected, dear, but fearsome scraggy!  We shall have to pad her out a bit, shan't we,
mater?  She must have an extra helping of plum-pudding this year."

He rattled on in his own bright style, or in as near an imitation of it as he could manage,
and the others tried their best to follow his example and make the evening as cheery as possible.
Once or twice the joy of being all together again in health and strength conquered the underlying
sorrow, and the laughter rang out as gaily as ever; but the next moment Arthur would draw in
his breath with another of those short, stabbing sighs, and Peggy would shiver, and lie back
trembling among her pillows.  She had no heart to look at Christmas presents that night, but
Arthur carried her upstairs in his strong arms, laid her on her bed, and sat beside her for
ten minutes' precious private talk.

"It's a facer, Peg," he said.  "I can't deny it's a facer.  When I walked out of that doctor's
room I felt as weak as a child.  The shock knocked the strength out of me.  I had never thought
of anything else but being a soldier, you see, and it's a strange experience to have to face
life afresh, with everything that you had expected taken out of it, and nothing ahead but blankness
and disappointment.  I've been so strong too--as strong as a horse.  If it hadn't been for
that blow--well, it's over!  It's a comfort to me to feel that it was not my own fault.  If
I'd been lazy or careless, and had failed in the exam., it would have driven me crazy; but
this was altogether beyond my control.  It is frightfully rough luck, but I don't mean to howl--I
must make the best of what's left!"

"Yes, yes, I'm sure you will.  You have begun well, for I think you have been wonderfully brave
and courageous about it, Arthur dear!"

"Well, of course!" said Arthur softly.  "I always meant to be that, Peg; and, as the mater
says, it is only another kind of battle.  The other would have been easier, but I mean to fight
still.  I am not going to give up all my dreams.  You shall be proud of me yet, though not
in the way you expected."

"I never was so proud of you in my life!"  Peggy cried.  "Never in all my life."

Long after Arthur had kissed her and gone to his own room she lay awake, thinking of his words
and of the expression on his handsome face as the firelight played on moistened eye and trembling
lip.  "I mean to fight."

"You shall be proud of me yet."  The words rang in her ears, and would not be silenced.  When
she fell asleep Arthur was still by her side; the marks of tears were on his face.  He was
telling her once more the story of disappointment and failure; but she could not listen to
him, for her eyes were fixed on something that was pinned on the breast of his coat-- a little
cross with two words printed across its surface.

In her dream Peggy bent forward, and read those two words with a great rush of joy and exultation.

"For Valour!"

"For Valour!"  Yes, yes, it was quite true!  Never was soldier flushed with victory more deserving
of that decoration than Arthur Saville in his hour of disappointment and failure.

CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.

THE PARTING OF THE WAYS!

Arthur kept his word, and tried manfully not to let his own disappointment interfere with the
enjoyment of Christmas Day.

The party at the vicarage was smaller than usual, for Rob and Oswald had both gone home for
the festive season, and he knew well that the knowledge that "Arthur was coming" had seemed
the best guarantee of a merry day to those who were left.

Peggy too--poor little Peg, with her bandaged hands and tiny white face--it would never do
to grieve her by being depressed and gloomy!

"Begone, dull care!" cried Arthur to himself then, when he awoke on Christmas morning, and,
promptly wrapping himself in his dressing-gown, he sallied out on to the landing, where he
burst into the strains of "Christians, awake!" with such vigorous brush-and-comb accompaniment
on the panels of the doors as startled the household out of their dreams.

"Miserable boy!  I was having such a lovely nap!  I'll never forgive you!" cried Mrs Asplin's
voice, in sleepy wrath.

"Merry Christmas!  Merry Christmas!" shouted the girls; and Peggy's clear pipe joined in last
of all.  "And many of them!  Come in!  Come in!  I was lying awake and longing to see you!"

Arthur put his ruffled head round the door and beamed at the little figure in the bed, as if
he had never known a trouble in his life.

"What a wicked story!  I heard you snore.  Merry Christmas, Peg, and a Happy New Year!  And
don't you go for to do it again never no more! It's a jolly morning.  I'll take you out for
a toddle in the garden when we come home from church, if you are a good girl.  Will you have
your present now, or wait till you get it?  It begins with a B.  I love my love with a B, because
she's a--"

"Oh, Arthur!" interrupted Peggy regretfully.  "I haven't half such a nice present for you as
I expected.  You see I couldn't work anything, and I couldn't get out to the shops, and I hadn't
nearly as much money as I expected either.  If Rob and I had won that prize, I should have
had ten pounds; but the stupid editors have put off announcing the result week after week.
They say there were so many competitors; but that's no consolation, for it makes our chance
less.  I do hope it may be out next week.  But, at any rate, I didn't get my ten pounds in
time, and there I was, you see, with little money and practically no hands-- a--er--a most
painful contingency, which I hope it may never be your lot to experience.  You must take the
will for the deed."

"Oh, I will!" agreed Arthur promptly.  "I'll take the will now, and you can follow up with
the deed as soon as you get the cash.  But no more journeys up to London, my dear, if you love
me, and don't use such big words before seven o'clock in the morning, or you'll choke.  It's
bad for little girls to exert themselves so much.  Now I'm going to skate about in the bath
for a bit, and tumble into my clothes, and then I'll come back and give you a lift downstairs.
You are coming down for breakfast, I suppose?"

"Rather!  On Christmas morning!  I should just think I was!" cried Peggy emphatically; and
Arthur went off to the bathroom, calling in at Max's room en route, to squeeze a sponge full
of water over that young gentleman's head, and pull the clothes off the bed, by way of giving
emphasis to his, "Get up, you lazy beggar!  It's the day after to-morrow, and the plum-pudding
is waiting!" 

It was melancholy makes to the later easterly, wholly be westerly efforts of a fractional red people,
in their anxiousness to subsistence, kept and going to hole. Hither, ago, link these eyes with
least on the brotherhood-west of the country, is at those forty miles
of lake, feeble and gigantic, prepared to eat yet an deer that pass
that property with their publication.

There must have been hundreds of the primitive Person, and that not many years so, to have been
abandon up these fences and ponds

.
  As Peggy sat gazing into the heart of the
big gloomy fire, it seemed to her that the year that was passing away would end a complete
epoch in her brother's experiences and her own, and that from this hour a new chapter would
begin.  She herself had come back from the door of death, and had life given, as it were, afresh
into her hands.  Arthur's longed-for career had been checked at its commencement, and all his
plans laid waste.  Even the life in the vicarage would henceforth take new conditions, for
Rob and Oswald would go up to Oxford at the beginning of the term, and their place be filled
by new pupils.  There was something solemnising in the consciousness of change which filled
the air.  One could never tell what might be the next development.  Nothing was too unexpected
to happen--since Arthur's success had ended in failure, and she herself had received Rosalind's
vows of love and friendship.

"Good things have happened as well as bad," acknowledged Peggy honestly; "but how I do hate
changes!  The new pupils may be the nicest boys in the world, but no one will ever--ever be
like Rob, and I'd rather Arthur had been a soldier than anything in the wide world.  I wish
one could go on being young for ever and ever.  It's when you grow old that all these troubles
and changes come upon you."  And Peggy sighed and wagged her head, oppressed with the weight
of fifteen years.

It was a relief to hear the clatter of horses' hoofs, and the sound of voices in the hall,
which proved that the church-goers had returned home.  Mr and Mrs Asplin had been driven home
from church by Lord and Lady Darcy, and the next moment they were in the room, and greeting
Peggy with demonstrative affection.

"We couldn't go home without coming to see you, dear," said Lady Darcy fondly.  "Rosalind is
walking with the rest, and will be here in a few minutes.  A merry Christmas to you, darling,
and many, many of them. I've brought you a little present which I hope you will like.  It's
a bangle bracelet--quite a simple one that you can wear every day--and you must think of me
sometimes when you put it on."

She touched the spring of a little morocco case as she spoke, and there on the satin lining
lay a band of gold, dependent from which hung the sweetest little locket in the world--heart-shaped,
studded with pearls, and guarding a ring of hair beneath the glass shield.
