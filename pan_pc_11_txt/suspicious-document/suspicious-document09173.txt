I. THE TABLETS, AND HOW THEY WERE FOUND.

As early as 1820 it was known in Europe that in Middle Egypt, on the east bank of the Nile,
in the district between Minieh and Siut, there lay the remains of a great city of Ancient Egypt.
The Prussian exploration expedition of 1842-45 gave special attention to this site, where indeed
were found, about sixty miles south of Minieh, extensive ruins, beginning at the village of
Haggi Kandil and covering the floor of a rock-bound valley named after the fellahin village,
El Amarna. At that time the ground-plan of the city was still easy to distinguish; the regular
lines of the streets could be traced, and enough could be seen of the great design of the principal
temple to excite the admiration of the discoverers. This example of the laying out of an ancient
Egyptian town still remains almost unique, for of old, as now, private buildings were constructed
of flimsy material. That the Tell el Amarna remains have escaped rapid destruction is due entirely
to the sudden and violent downfall of the original splendour of the city and the complete desolation
which succeeded. The importance of the place was revealed on examination of the surrounding
cliffs. Here were found, sculptured and inscribed in a new and peculiar style, the rock-cut
tombs of the most distinguished inhabitants of Akhet-haten, the royal city built for himself
about 1380 B.C. by Amenophis IV., and destroyed soon after his early death.

In the beginning of 1888 some fellahìn digging for marl not far from the ruins came upon a
number of crumbling wooden chests, filled with clay tablets closely covered on both sides with

 On the other hand, the letters of the king of Mitani are drawn up in
the characters known as Assyrian; and it is probable that the Assyrian system of cuneiform
may have originated in Mitani. If so, for the Mitani scribe there could be no question of any
special difficulty in using the acknowledged language of diplomacy in the Ancient East.

It is evident that the Babylonian royal scribes at length showed some consideration for their
unfortunate Egyptian correspondents by writing as a rule in phonograms which could be easily
spelt out, since strange ideograms might have brought the reader to a standstill. The sources
of the letters may be distinguished also by the colour and consistency of the material of the
tablets, which are of all shades of clay, from pale yellow to red or dark brown. Side by side,
too, with hard and legible pieces, lie broken and crumbling fragments which have suffered sadly
during the few years that have elapsed since they were again exposed to the air.

II. THE EGYPTIAN COURT AND ADMINISTRATION.

The two Pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna Period belong to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which about 1560
B.C. had freed the land from the yoke of certain Asiatic invaders known as the Shasu. The new
dynasty soon began to encroach upon Asia. King Thutmosis III. (1503 to 1449 B.C.) after many
chequered campaigns conquered Syria as far as the Gulf of Iskanderun. On the African side he
extended the bounds of his kingdom to the confluence of the Nile and the Atbara, so that the
greater part of Nubia owned his sway. The terror of his name did not die with him, but for
long did good service to his successors, the first of whom, Amenophis II., seems moreover himself
to have maintained energetically the fame of Egyptian arms. To this influence our clay tablets
bear witness by twice making emphatic reference to the days of the powerful “Manakhbiria”—the
prenomen of King Thutmosis III. With the accession of Amenophis III. the warlike spirit ceased
to prevail at the Court of Thebes. Nothing more was to be gained by Egypt in Western Asia,
and the tastes of the new king lay in other directions than war. The two celebrated Colossi
of Memnon (statues of himself), many great buildings, the important part played by his favourite
wife Teye, the well-filled harem,  the cultivation of “wisdom” (which practically, no doubt,
was tantamount to what we should call “preciosity”); last, but not least, the solemn adoration
of his own divine image—all these facts combine to indicate the altered condition of things
which came about under Amenophis III. He reigned thirty-six years, long enough to allow the
movement introduced by him to run its course. His son, Amenophis IV., was, however, just as
little inclined as his father to walk in the steps of his warlike ancestors. Hampered apparently
by bodily defects, this Son of the Sun tried his strength in a field often far more dangerous
than the battlefield. He began a reform of the Egyptian religion, apparently in the direction
of a kind of monotheism in which the chief worship was reserved for the disk of the sun, the
symbol under which the god Ra was adored at Heliopolis in the Delta.

Nothing being known of the life of this king as heir-apparent, probably we shall never understand
what led him to take this new departure. From his conduct during the early years of his reign
it may be concluded that he intended to proceed gradually, but was roused to more aggressive
measures by the resistance of the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes. These men acted, of course,
for their own interests in promptly resisting even mild attempts at reform. Perhaps also the
king’s aim had been from the outset to weaken the influence of the Theban hierarchy by new
doctrines and to strengthen the royal power by steady secularisation. Open strife between the
adherents of Amon and those of the Sun’s Disk, the “Aten,” broke out in the second or third
year of Amenophis IV., that is, about 1380 B.C. The immediate removal of the Court from Thebes
to Tell el Amarna points to a failure of the royal efforts, for the command to build the new
city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished. The official
world promptly broke with the old religion. The king altered his throne-name, “Amen-hetep,”
to “Akhen-Aten,” “The glory of the Sun’s Disk”; his young daughters received names compounded
with “Aten,” whilst the courtiers found it advisable to strike out “Amen,” if this chanced
to form part of their own names, and to substitute for it “Ra,” as having more or less the
same significance as “Aten.” “The doctrine,” as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions
at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt, that the
officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information
regarding it. Most of them continue to refer to Amon in perfect innocence, and only a few who
were better informed began rather later to take the change into account. Thus Yitia of Ashkelon,
Pu-Adda of Wurza, and a certain Addudaian correct the name of the Egyptian commissioner “Amanappa”
into “Rianappa.” Abimilki of Tyre apparently even tried to give himself out as one initiated
into “the doctrine,” and to represent his city as a servant of Aten. If this were the case
he must have received a severe rebuff, for after his one attempt he falls back into the old
style. Neither the royal nor the national pride of Egypt would suffer any such familiarities.

The new capital received the significant name of “Akhet-Aten” (“Horizon of the Sun”) and was
solemnly consecrated long before it was half finished. The widow of Amenophis III., the queen-mother
Teye, came occasionally to visit the new capital, and was received with all honour; evidently
she had paid timely respect to her son’s opinions. How far the Aten dogma represented real
progress in religious thought can be gathered only from the contents of a few hymns remaining
on the walls of some of the tombs. In these the expression of devout feeling seems to have
become richer and more spontaneous, and the monotheistic tendency is evident. This characteristic,
however, may often be observed by a sympathetic reader in the hymns to Amon, and even to less
important deities: the deity adopted as a special object of worship by any individual is always
favourably represented by him. The Aten dogma, being based on natural phenomena and not on
mythology, was, of course, heretical.

Those of his officials who had accepted “the doctrine” were regarded by Akhenaten as deserving
men, and on this ground alone, Ai, called Haya in the Amarna letters, received golden honours
to the full. This Haya, who was entitled “beloved royal scribe,” was probably a secretary of
state, and was once sent as a special ambassador to Babylonia. Dudu occupied another important
post; Amanappa, who has already been mentioned, seems from a letter written by him to Rib-Addi
of Gebal, to have been a commander-in-chief. Hani, Salma, Paura, Pahamnata, Hatib Maya, Shuta,
Hamashni, and Zitana all appear as the bearers of royal commissions in Syrian territory. An
official named Shakhshi receives instruction as to the conducting of a royal caravan. But to
the Asiatic vassals the most important office of all was the governorship of Lower Egypt, the
country called “Yarimuta,” an office filled at this time by Yanhamu. The letters afford abundant
evidence that any vassal who had incurred Yanhamu’s enmity must walk warily. The minister of
the king of Alashia, though his equal in rank, sent gifts to this dangerous man, who had harassed
merchants of Alashia by demanding from them illegal dues. Rib-Addi of Gebal lost land and throne,
in spite of the countenance of Amanappa, because such was Yanhamu’s pleasure; and of Milki-El
of Gath he made a severe example, to which we shall refer later.

On the whole, the Asiatic provinces enjoyed self-government under the supremacy of Egypt, and
the disadvantages of this condition of things are revealed in numerous letters. These end almost
invariably with a request to the king to come in person to the aid of his distressed vassals,
or at least to send troops. Sometimes this was done, but usually such expeditions seem to have
been undertaken with inadequate forces and seldom resulted in permanent peace. The native princes,
chiefs, and village headmen were perpetually struggling with each other. They made alliances
among themselves, or they entered into secret treaties with neighbouring states and afterwards
brazenly denied them. This wretched state of affairs may be traced to two principal causes—the
tribute question and the immigration of Bedawìn tribes.

The king was not to be trifled with when tribute was overdue. The most valid excuses—loss of
territory, war, failure of the harvest—were received with a suspicion doubtless justified in
general but which must have caused much hardship in individual cases. The ordinary tribute
was fixed, as well as the regular subsidy for royal troops and the force which had to be raised
in emergencies. But the gifts—such as female slaves—which must needs be sent not only to the
courtiers but even to the king himself, added enormously to the burden, so much so that to
the poorer chiefs a summons from Egypt to appear in person meant little less than ruin. Resistance
to it was so surely to be counted on that such a summons was often kept in the background more
as a threat than anything else. Now and then petty chiefs in Palestine and Syria withheld their
bushels of corn, their three oxen or their twenty sheep; or perhaps they were so sparing of
bakshìsh that the tribute itself was swallowed up and vanished entirely from the accounts.
It was scarcely possible to take costly measures to punish such delinquents, so the business
was turned over to some kind neighbour of the recalcitrant chief, and a little war was soon
fairly ablaze. But when direct commands of royal ambassadors were treated as of doubtful authenticity,
it was hardly likely that the authority placed in the hands of an equal would meet with much
respect. Both leaders received reinforcements; a third intervened at a moment favourable to
himself; many and often very remote quarrels broke out, and when at length the royal commissioners
hurried upon the scene it was hard for them to say whether or not the original sentence had
been executed. Certainly most of the property of the original offenders had been largely lost
or destroyed, but the plunder had crumbled away in passing through countless hands, and the
royal official might seek it from Dan to Beersheba, or farther, but in vain. Out of the first
difficulty a dozen others had arisen, till the suzerain seized upon his dues by force, yet
without leaving peace behind him. The tablets are full of references to these complicated struggles,
which it is not always possible to follow in detail.

Additional confusion was caused by the immigration of Bedawìn tribes. In the north the nomadic
Sutu, in the south the Habiri pressed forward and encroached upon Egyptian territory. It is
evident that this further pressure was calculated to bring matters to a crisis, for, like the
tribute, it affected pre-eminently the vassal chiefs and tribes. We find the Habiri especially
in the very act of ruining some of these petty princes, others of whom preferred to make treaties
with their unwelcome guests, though this indeed was apparently in secret only. But the Sutu
reached the domains of more powerful vassals, and by two of these, Aziru and Namjauza, were
openly taken into pay. Obviously such alliances with land-seeking plunderers could only prolong
and embitter the strife. In Palestine, no doubt, peace as regards Egypt would soon have been
restored had not the Habiri proceeded to seize certain strongholds, which they used as centres
for further expeditions, thus involving the settled inhabitants in wider quarrels. What with
the help of the Bedawîn, and the universal unrest any ambitious vassal of Egypt must at length
have seen a tempting prospect of establishing an independent kingdom, if only he could deceive
the Egyptian Government long enough as to his intentions, and delay or thwart any measures
that might be taken against him.

Certainly the government of Pharaoh did not lack for watchfulness and was well, if not too
well, served in the matter of information. But in the face of perpetual complaints and counter-complaints,
entreaties for help and what were for the most part incredible assurances of everlasting fidelity,
there was no course for the king and his councillors to take but either to order a military
expedition on a large scale, or to turn a sceptical ear to all alike and confine their attention
simply to the tribute. ", is greater that there aren'march to have been affairs, napkhuria," us are based.

 Possibly it may have been kept as a copy, and in that case it must belong
to the early part of the correspondence. More probably however, the letter is an original which
came back “undelivered” to Egypt, the addressee having died in the meantime. Kadashman-Bel
had complained that his sister, who had been given by his father in marriage to the Egyptian,
had subsequently never once been seen by any Babylonian ambassadors. Certainly a woman in royal
garb had been pointed out, but not one of them had recognised her as their own princess. “Who
knows that it was not some beggar’s daughter, a Gagaian, or a maiden of Hanirabbat or Ugarit
whom my messengers saw?” Then Nimmuria took up the tale, and complained that Kadashman-Bel
sent only ambassadors who had never frequented his father’s Court, and were moreover of adverse
bias. “Send a kamiru” (evidently a eunuch is meant) “who knows thy sister.” Further misunderstandings
come under discussion, from which it is evident that the general situation between the two
princes was very much strained.

King Tushratta of Mitani was a phenomenon in his way. In Egyptian inscriptions his kingdom
is called Naharina—i.e., “Mesopotamia.” One of his tablets bears the following official memorandum,
written in red ink and in hieratic:

    “[Received] in the two-[and-thirtieth year of the reign of
    Nimmuria], in the first winter month, on the tenth day, the Court
    being at the southern residence (Thebes), in the Residence
    Ka-em-Ekhut. Duplicate of the Naharina letter brought by the
    messenger Pirizzi and (another).”

Tushratta’s dominion was wide, extending from south-eastern Cappadocia to beyond the later
Assyrian capital, Nineveh. But the kingdom of Mitani, occasionally called after the northern
fatherland of its people, Hanirabbat, was nearing its fall.   In the south it had a dangerous
enemy in Babylonia; in the north and west the Hittites were hostile and all the more to be
dreaded since Mitani-Hanirabbat was inhabited by a people related to the Hittite stock. The
kings of Mitani soon realised that their existence was best secured by a steady alliance with
Egypt. To this end Artatama and Shutarna, the two predecessors of Tushratta, had sent their
daughters to the harem of the Pharaohs. The so-called “marriage scarab” of Nimmuria bears witness
to this, and reference to the bond is often made by Tushratta. Before he could ascend the throne
he had various difficulties to contend against, of which a faithful account is sent to Egypt:

    “When I ascended my father’s throne I was still young, for Pirhi
    did evil to my land and had slain its lord. Therefore he did evil
    to me also and to all my friends. But I quailed not before the
    crimes that were committed in my land, but slew the murderers of
    Artashumara my brother, with all their adherents. Know also, oh,
    my royal brother! that the whole army of the Hittites marched
    against my land. But the God Teshup, the lord, delivered them into
    my hand and I destroyed them. Not one man from their midst
    returned to his own land. And now I have sent to thee a chariot
    and two horses, a youth and a maiden, the booty of the land of the
    Hittites.”

This letter betrays itself as one of the earliest written for Tushratta by the fact that it
makes no request for gold. All his later letters are filled with greedy entreaties, completely
giving the lie to the immediate pretext under which they were professedly written. One of them,
more than a yard long and proportionately broad, still keeps its charms to itself, since for
some unknown reason, though written in cuneiform character like the rest, the language is that
of Hanirabbat and this we are still unable to read. Nimmuria indeed, seems to have had a weakness
for this worthy brother-in-law and his ingenuous manner of approaching him, and spared neither
presents nor promises; at his death, however, some of the latter remained unfulfilled. Evidently
neighbouring kings heard at length of Tushratta’s financial success and were naturally envious.
An extract will give the reader a more definite notion of this royal correspondence with its
stylisms and turns of thought. The following is taken from Letter VIII. in the British Museum
edition. The long-winded introduction was already a fixed convention, and occurs in all the
letters from whatever country, but the declaration of affection is peculiar to Tushratta:

    “To Nimmuria, the great king, the king of Egypt, my brother, my
    brother-in-law; who loves me and whom I love: Tushratta, the great
    king, thy (future) father-in-law, king of Mitani; who loves thee
    and is thy brother. It is well with me; may it be well with thee,
    with thy house, with my sister and thy other wives, with thy sons,
    thy chariots, thy horses, thy nobles, thy land, and all that is
    thine, may it be well with them indeed! Whereas thy fathers in
    their time kept fast friendship with my fathers, thou hast
    increased the friendship. Now, therefore, that thou and I are
    friends thou hast made it ten times closer than with my father.
    May the gods cause our friendship to prosper! May Teshup, the
    lord, and Amon ordain it eternally as it now is! I write this to
    my brother that he may show me even more love than he showed my
    father. Now I ask gold from my brother, and it behoves me to ask
    this gold for two causes: in the first place for war equipment (to
    be provided later), and secondly, for the dowry (likewise to be
    provided). So, then, let my brother send me much gold, without
    measure, more than to my father. For in my brother’s land gold is
    as the dust of the earth. May the gods grant that in the land of
    my brother, where already so much gold is, there may be ten times
    more in times to come! Certainly the gold that I require will not
    trouble my brother’s heart, but let him also not grieve my heart.
    Therefore let my brother send gold without measure, in great
    quantity. And I also will grant all the gifts that my brother
    asks. For this land is my brother’s land, and this my house is his
    house.”

All Tushratta’s letters are written in this tone with the exception of the last. Nimmuria felt
his end approaching, and entreated the aid of “Our Lady of Nineveh.” Such an expedient was
not foreign to Egyptian thought. A late inscription professes to tell how a certain divine
image was sent from Thebes to a distant land for the healing of a foreign princess. From Tushratta’s
answer also it appears that the statue of the goddess Ishtar had once before been taken from
Nineveh to Thebes.

This letter begins solemnly:

    “The words of Ishtar of Nineveh, mistress of all lands. ‘To Egypt,
    to the land that I love will I go, and there will I sojourn.’ Now
    I send her and she goes. Let my brother worship her and then let
    her go in gladness that she may return. May Ishtar protect my
    brother and me for a hundred thousand years. May she grant unto us
    both great gladness; may we know nothing but happiness.”

All this notwithstanding, Nimmuria must die, and later Tushratta describes his own grief on
the occasion:

    “And on that day I wept, I sat in sorrow. Food and drink I touched
    not on that day; grieved was my heart. I said, ‘Oh, that it had
    been I who died !’ ”

When he wrote thus the feelings expressed were probably genuine, for times had changed sadly
for him and men of his type.

We have now come to the accession of the reforming king Napkhuria—i.e., Akhenaten. This zealot
succeeded in bringing into the foreign relations of Egypt some of the unrest caused by his
measures in home politics. To begin with, he sought for new political alliances and sacrificed
those already existing, not by breaking off the connections, but by turning a deaf ear to requests,
or by adopting an insolent tone in his answers. On one occasion he showered on the old beggar
Tushratta derision which was no doubt well deserved, but which it was most impolitic to express
so plainly. He gives one the impression of an inexperienced prince, brought up in Oriental
seclusion, who persists at all hazards in playing the part of a shrewd and worldly-wise ruler.
He strained after novelty at the expense of his own security, and attempted to demonstrate
the strength of the supports of his throne by sawing them through.

About the time of Nimmuria’s death Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia also died, and Burnaburiash,
probably his brother or cousin, was prepared on his accession to maintain the traditional friendship
with Egypt. But at the very beginning Napkhuria was guilty of a breach of etiquette in neglecting
to send any expression of sympathy during a long illness of Burnaburiash. In spite of many
fine words, the usual matrimonial negotiations did not run smoothly; moreover, attacks were
made on travelling messengers, and at length Napkhuria’s avarice forced the Babylonian to measures
of retaliation, and he writes:

    “Since ambassadors from thy fathers came to my fathers, they also
    have lived on friendly terms. We should continue in the same.
    Messengers have now come from thee thrice, but thou hast sent with
    them no gift worthy the name. I also shall desist in the same way.
    If nothing is denied me I shall deny thee nothing.”

Meanwhile, the dear brother in Egypt was continually finding opportunities to annoy the Babylonian.
Assyria was then a small state on the middle Tigris, in exactly the same relation to the suzerainty
of Babylonia as Canaan was to that of Egypt. Disregarding this fact, Napkhuria sent a very
large quantity of gold to the prince Assurnadinakhi and ostentatiously received an Assyrian
embassy. Burnaburiash, in remonstrating, referred to the loyal conduct of his father, Kurigalzu,
who had answered the Canaanites with threats when, in an attempted rising against Nimmuria,
they offered to do homage to Kurigalzu.

    “Now there are the Assyrians, my vassals. Have not I already
    written to thee in regard to them? If thou lovest me they will
    gain nothing from thee. Let them depart unsuccessful.”

This exhortation seems to have been vain, for a letter of the next Assyrian king, Assuruballit,
speaks of a regular exchange of messengers, and indicates that the Sutu of the desert—doubtless
at the instigation of the Babylonians—were about to kill every Egyptian who showed himself
in their territory.

A prince of Alashia, who never mentions either his own name or that of the Egyptian king, wrote
short letters, for the most part of a business character. Alashia probably lay on the Cilician
coast. Gold did not tempt him; he asked modestly for silver in return for copper, for oil,
textiles and manufactured articles in return for wood for building. Thus the tablets from Alashia
are rich in information regarding commercial matters and questions of public rights. They are
of special interest for us, owing to the fact that one of them contains the first historic
mention of the plague.

    “Behold! my brother, I have sent thee five hundred talents of
    copper as a gift. Let it not grieve my brother’s heart that it is
    too little. For in my land the hand of Nergal (the god of
    pestilence) has slain all the workers, and copper cannot be
    produced. And, my brother, take it not to heart that thy messenger
    stayed three years in my land. For the hand of Nergal is in it,
    and in my house my young wife died.”

Yet this ruler also had to guard himself against embassies unworthy of a king sent by Napkhuria.
Another prince, in a letter unfortunately much damaged, made the complaint that Napkhuria had
once caused his own name to be written first in a letter. This was, indeed, unparalleled; the
title of the recipient stands first even in a severe reprimand sent to the Egyptian vassal
Aziru. As if to equalise matters, in royal letters the greetings that follow the address begin
with a mention of the welfare of the writer. “It is well with me. May it be well with thee,”
&c. There is, however, one tablet addressed to Napkhuria that committed the offence complained
of, and it was perhaps for this reason that the introductory address was scratched through
anciently. It is fairly certain that this letter, as well as the one complaining of Napkhuria’s
breach of etiquette, came from the Hittite king. The tone throughout is very decided, and complaints
of neglect of proper consideration are not wanting.

A short time before his death Nimmuria had married another daughter of Tushratta, Tadukhipa,
the long inventory of whose dowry was found at Tell el Amarna. On receiving the news—for which
he was already prepared—of the death of his hoary-headed son-in-law, Tushratta at once sent
Pirizzi and Bubri “with lamentations” to Napkhuria. He managed to suppress his personal wishes
up to the third message, but prepared the way for them by calling Teye, the chief wife of Nimmuria,
as a witness. “And all the matters that I negotiated with thy father, Teye, thy mother, knoweth
them; none other besides knoweth of them.” Immediately after this came the request that Napkhuria
should send him the “golden images” (statuettes) that Nimmuria had promised him. And Napkhuria
wasted no words, but sent by the messenger Hamashi—the wooden models! He seems to have thought
he was acting as a good son and a shrewd man of business in fulfilling his father’s promises
at so cheap a rate.

But Tushratta was not easily shaken off. His next move was to send Teye and her son each a
letter at the same time. He gave polite greetings from his wife Yuni to the widow, whose influence
was evidently still strong, sent her presents, and entreated her intercession. This remarkable
letter runs as follows:

    “To Teye, Queen of Egypt, Tushratta, King of Mitani. May it be
    well with thee, may it be well with thy son, may it be well with
    Tadukhipa, my daughter, thy young companion in widowhood. Thou
    knowest that I was in friendship with Nimmuria, thy husband, and
    that Nimmuria was in friendship with me. What I wrote to him and
    negotiated with him, and likewise what Nimmuria thy husband wrote
    to me and negotiated with me, thou and Gilia and Mani (Tushratta’s
    messengers), ye know it. But thou knowest it better than all
    others. And none other knows it. Now thou hast said to Gilia: ‘Say
    to thy lord, Nimmuria my husband was in friendship with thy father
    and sent him the military standards, which he kept. The embassies
    between them were never interrupted. But now, forget not thou
    thine old friendship with thy brother Nimmuria and extend it to
    his son Napkhuria. Send joyful embassies; let them not be
    omitted.’ Lo, I will not forget the friendship with Nimmuria!
    More, tenfold more, words of friendship will I exchange with
    Napkhuria thy son and keep up right good friendship. But the
    promise of Nimmuria, the gift that thy husband ordered to be
    brought to me, thou hast not sent. I asked for golden statuettes.
    But now Napkhuria thy son has had them made of wood, though gold
    is as dust in thy land. Why does this happen just now? Should not
    Napkhuria deliver that to me which his father gave me? And he
    wishes to increase our friendship tenfold! Wherefore then dost
    thou not bring this matter before thy son Napkhuria? Even though
    thou do it not he ought nevertheless to deliver unto me statuettes
    of gold and in no way to slight me. Thus friendship will reign
    between us tenfold. Let thy messengers to Yuni my wife depart with
    Napkhuria’s ambassador, and Yuni’s messenger shall come to thee.
    Lo, I send gifts for thee; boxes filled with good oil (perfume),”
    &c. &c.

To Napkhuria also Tushratta insists on his rights in detail. The messengers from Mitani were
said to have been present at the casting of the images, and even to have started on their journey
home when Nimmuria died. It may thus be assumed that Napkhuria at once ordered the transport
to be brought back. Queen Teye evidently showed no desire to be mixed up in so unpleasant a
business, but Napkhuria demanded that the messenger Gilia should be sent to him.

Most probably this often-mentioned Gilia was the witness present at the casting and despatching
of the images. Tushratta gave evasive answers, and his last letter (more than two hundred lines
in length) is something in the nature of an ultimatum. On both sides fresh complaints are brought
forward, and the settlement of each one of them was made dependent on the settlement of the
principal question. Napkhuria threatened to close his land against all subjects of Mitani,
and, as no later document has been found, it is probable that at this point all intercourse
ceased. A much mutilated letter from Gebal to Egypt announces the departure of the king of
Mitani with an armed force; but it is doubtful whether this can be quoted in the present connection.

The characters of the two irreconcilable monarchs, who show each other up so admirably for
our edification, make any question as to which had right on his side seem comparatively trifling.
Tushratta was evidently much distressed that he dared not venture to send his Gilia back again
and that none of the later letters which he had from Nimmuria contained any word of the golden
images. It is evident also that Napkhuria, supported by Teye, had actually recalled embassies
that his father had already sent out. The old king, who had called Ishtar of Nineveh to his
help, may have been brought by the approach of death into a generous state of mind not uncommon
in such cases. Even now we say, “He must be near his end,” when a man shows unexpected and
unusual gentleness. It is quite possible that Nimmuria had ordered the images in question to
be made for his worthy friend without giving any formal promise to send them, and that as soon
as Tushratta learned what had happened, he promptly interposed with a lie, in hope of appealing
to Napkhuria’s sense of the fitness of things. That, however, was expecting too much.

IV. LETTERS FROM ASIATIC VASSALS.

Four-fifths of the number of letters consist of reports and communications from Egyptian governors,
military commanders, magistrates, and other officials in Western Asia. The form of address
from these subordinates to the Pharaoh is naturally very different from “Royal Brother,” and
in hurried announcements it is often contracted. Written in full the long formula runs:

    “To the king, my lord, my gods, my sun, the sun of heaven; Yitia,
    prefect of Askelon is thy servant, the dust at thy feet, the
    servant of thy horses. At the feet of the king my lord seven times
    and again seven times I prostrate myself upon my back and upon my
    breast.”

The importance of these letters, however, consists in the substance of what they report and
in what they tell us as to the doings of the writers. They are the data by reason of which
the Tell el Amarna archives constitute a unique store of historical material for the study
of the history of civilisation.

Warlike expeditions among the vassal chiefs were the order of the day. Most dangerous of all
the chiefs was Aziru, prefect of the land of the Amorites, whose territory included the district
north of Damascus and part of the valley of the Orontes. In the hope of founding an independent
kingdom, Aziru had swiftly seized on the dominions of all the chiefs on his northern boundary,
and in this action his admirable understanding with the Egyptian officials afforded him invaluable
help. The town of Tunip sent a truly pathetic letter to Pharaoh from which we learn that Aziru
had already taken Nii, was besieging Simyra in Phœnicia, and at the same time, by the aid of
his creatures at Court, had succeeded in preventing the king from reinstating a prince of Tunip
who had been sent into Egypt as a hostage. This prince, a certain Yadi Addu, had already been
released and was on his way home when the allies of Aziru caused him to be recalled.

    “If, however, we have to mourn,” so the complaint proceeds, “the
    king himself will soon have to mourn over those things which Aziru
    has committed against us, for next he will turn his hand against
    his lord. But Tunip, thy city, weeps; her tears flow; nowhere is
    there help for us.”

The most bitter complaints against Aziru and his father Abd-Ashera come from Rib-Addi of Gebal.
His utterances rival the Lamentations of Jeremiah both in volume and in monotonous pathos.
One of these many letters, the contents of which are often stereotyped enough, is also noticeable
for its revelation of the connection of Rib-Addi, who must already have been an elderly man,
with Amanappa:

    “To Amanappa, my father; Rib-Addi, thy son! At my father’s feet I
    fall. Again and again I asked thee, ‘Canst thou not rescue me from
    the hand of Abd-Ashera? All the Habiri are on his side; the
    princes will hear no remonstrances, but are in alliance with him;
    thereby is he become mighty.’ But thou hast answered me, ‘Send thy
    messenger with me to Court, and then will I, if nothing be said
    against it (i.e., by the king), send him again and again with
    royal troops to thee till the Pidati march forth to secure thy
    life.’ Then I answered thee, ‘I will not delay to send the man,
    but nothing of this must come to the ears of Abd-Ashera, for
    [Yanhamu has] taken [silver] from his hand.’ (As much as to say
    that if Abd-Ashera gives Yanhamu a hint, the messenger will never
    get beyond Lower Egypt.) But thou hast said, ‘Fear not, but send a
    ship to the Yarimuta, and money and garments will come to thee
    thence.’ Now, behold, the troops which thou hast given me have
    fled, because thou hast neglected me, while I have obeyed thee. He
    hath spoken with the official (Yanhamu?) nine times [in vain].
    Behold, thou art delaying with regard to this offence as with the
    others. What then can save me? If I receive no troops I shall
    forsake my city, and flee, doing that which seems good to me to
    preserve my life.”

Yanhamu’s bias against Rib-Addi is made evident in many other letters which the poor wretch
addressed to the Court:

    “If I should make a treaty with Abd-Ashera as did Yap-Addi and
    Zimrida, then I should be safe. Furthermore, since Simyra is
    indeed lost to me, and Yanhamu hath received Bit-Arti, he ought to
    send me provision of grain that I may defend the king’s city for
    him. "and manners, so, we learn to assist'i make thou wrote," i. It confine

 Probably he failed to induce his undisciplined officers
to act in unison, and the unhappy man’s sole achievement seems to have been the welding of
his foes into a compact body against himself. He lost his territory, kept up the struggle a
little longer as a freebooter, was taken captive at Megiddo, escaped again on the eve of being
shipped to Egypt, and fell in battle or died a natural death after at length meeting apparently
with some success in Judæa.

Jerusalem was under a royal “Uweu,” a term perhaps best rendered “captain,” named Abdikheba.
A neighbouring prefect, Shuwardata, asserted occasionally that he had entered into conspiracies
with Labaya, and Abdikheba in fact complained of hostilities on all sides. Milki-El and his
father-in-law Tagi, chiefs in the Philistian plain near Gath, were his principal opponents.
They recruited troops from among the Habiri in the hope that Abdikheba, finding himself practically
blockaded, would weary of the struggle and abandon the field. He was evidently very nearly
driven to this when he wrote:

    “Infamous things have been wrought against me. To see it would
    draw tears from the eyes of the king, so do my foes press me.
    Shall the royal cities fall a prey to the Habiri? If the Pidati do
    not come in the course of this year, let the king send messengers
    to fetch me and all my brethren that we may die in the presence of
    the king, our lord.”

By the Habiri we must here understand no other than the Hebrews, who were therefore already
to be found in the “Promised Land,” but had not yet firmly established themselves there. They
swarmed in the Lebanon, where Namyauza had formally enlisted one of their hordes; and yet it
seems as if they already held Shechem and Mount Ephraim as free tribal property. At any rate,
no letter thence to the king has been discovered, although there is one mention of the city
Shakmi (Shechem). The genuinely ancient passages in the scriptural accounts of the conquest
in the Book of Joshua, and still more the valuable fragments in the first chapter of Judges,
are fairly in accordance with what we here learn from the tablets.

Abdikheba’s letters may be considered along with those of Milki-El and Tagi, of whom Yanhamu,
the powerful official, had just made an example. Their voices take up the chorus of complaint:

    ABDIKHEBA. “Lo! Milki-El and Tagi have done as follows.... Thus,
    as the king liveth, hath Milki-El committed treachery against me.
    Send Yanhamu that he may see what is done in the king’s land.”

    MILKI-EL. “The king, my lord, shall know the deed done by Yanhamu
    after I had been dismissed by the king. Lo, he took three thousand
    talents from me and said to me, ‘Give me thy wife and thy sons
    that I may slay them.’ May my lord, the king, remember this deed
    and send us chariots to bring us away.”

    TAGI. “Am I not a servant of the king? But my brother is full of
    wounds so that I can send no message by him to the king. Ask the
    rabisu (a title of Yanhamu) whether my brother is not full of
    wounds. But we turn our eyes to thee, to know whether we may rise
    to heaven or creep into the earth; our heads remain in thy hand.
    Behold, I shall try to make my way to the king by the hand of the
    surgeons.”

    MILKI-EL. “I have received the king’s message. Let him send the
    Pidati to protect his servant, and grains of myrrh gum for
    healing.”

As already pointed out, the blame for such occurrences belongs in the first place to the Egyptian
system of government. How little the petty princes could expect, whether of good or evil, from
their suzerain is shown by glaring examples. King Burnaburiash complained that a Babylonian
trading company established by his ambassador in the Canaanite city of Khinaton had, immediately
after the ambassador’s departure, been attacked and utterly plundered. The principals were
killed, and the rest—some of them mutilated—were sent into slavery. “Canaan is thy land; thou
art king of it,” continues Burnaburiash. “It was in thy land that I suffered this injury; therefore
restrain the doers of it. Replace the stolen gold, and slay the murderers of my subjects to
avenge their blood.” Whether this was done was extremely doubtful, for part of the plunder
had in all probability already sufficed to secure a safe retreat for the brigands, who, furthermore,
were officials from some of whom letters have been found. The natural consequence was that
the ambassadors themselves were attacked. Their caravan with gifts for Napkhuria was robbed
twice in succession, and they themselves were held to ransom. The Egyptian Government nevertheless
remained outrageously slack as ever, as we may see from the following safe conduct granted
on behalf of the Canaanite miscreants: “To the princes in the land of Canaan, the vassals of
my brother. Akiya, my messenger, I send to the King of Egypt my brother. Bring him safe and
quickly to Egypt. Let no violence befall him.”

Prefects of Canaanite ports were naturally in most active communication with Egypt. On some
of the shrewder minds among these men it had dawned that it pleased and amused the king to
have immediate news of messages by sea and land from far and near communicated in their letters.
Abi-milki of Tyre had carried this practice farthest, and he was also admirably skilful in
lodging complaints by the way. We owe to this worthy one of the choicest pieces in the whole
collection, the elegant pæan of a place-hunter of more than three thousand years ago. It will
be noticed that some of his rhetorical expressions repeatedly recall those of the Hebrew Psalter
in the same way as do phrases in the letter of Tagi already quoted. In fact, the Bible critic
has much to learn from the tablets as a whole. After the formal beginning, Abi-milki launches
out as follows:

    “My lord the king is the Sun-God, rising each day over the earth
    according to the will of his gracious father, the heavenly Sun-God
    (Aten). His words give life and prosperity. To all lands his might
    giveth peace. Like the (Phœnician) god Ram-man, so he thunders
    down from heaven, and the earth trembles before him. Behold, thy
    servant writeth as soon as he has good news to send the king. And
    the fear of my lord, the king, fell upon the whole land till the
    messenger made known the good news from the king my lord. When I
    heard through him the command of the king to me, ‘Be at the
    disposal of my high officials,’ then thy servant answered his
    lord, ‘It is already done.’ On my breast and on my back write I
    down for myself the commands of the king. Verily, he who
    hearkeneth to the king his lord, and serveth him with love, the
    Sun-God riseth over him, and a good word from the mouth of his
    lord giveth him life. If he heed not the commands of his lord his
    city will fall, his house will perish, and his name will be known
    no more for ever in all lands. But he who followeth his lord as a
    faithful servant, his city is prosperous, his house is secure, and
    his name shall endure for ever.”

The letter continues for some time in the same strain, but at the end the courtier bethinks
him of his office of informer, and adds hastily:

    “Furthermore, Zimrida, the prefect of Sidon, sends a report every
    day to Aziru, Abd-Ashera’s son. Every word that comes from Egypt
    he telleth to him. I, however, tell it to my lord, that it may
    serve thee, oh my lord!”

Two princes, Adad-nirari of Nukhashi and another whose name is now illegible, apparently take
a higher rank than their neighbours. Nukhashi is often named in these tablets as well as in
Egyptian inscriptions, and it must have been situated on the north-east slope of the Lebanon
range. We have also letters from the towns of Biruta (Beyrout), Hashab, Hazi, Kumidi, Kadesh
on the Orontes, Sidon, Akko, Rubiza, Megiddo, Hazor, Gezer, Gaza, Lachish, Shamhuna, Mushihuma,
Dubu, and others, while there are many more so mutilated that their origin can no longer be
determined.

These letters, though by no means all of them containing important contributions to the history
of political intrigue, are often of interest from the light they throw on manners and customs.
A few further extracts are therefore given here.

    “To the king my lord, my gods, my sun; Yabitiri is thy servant,
    the dust of thy feet, &c. And a faithful servant of the king am I.
    I look hither, and I look thither, but it is not light; then I
    look to the king my lord, then there is light. A brick may be
    removed from its firm bed, but I move not away from the king’s
    feet. Let my lord the king ask Yanhamu, his rabisu. While I was
    still young he brought me to Egypt, and I served my lord the king
    and stood at the gate of the palace (as page). And to-day, let my
    lord the king ask his rabisu, I guard the gates of Gaza and of
    Joppa. I am also attached to the Pidati of my lord the king;
    whither they go thither do I go with them, as even now. On my neck
    rests the yoke of my lord the king, and I bear it.”

The following tablet from the neighbourhood of the Jordan promises good results as the reward
of future research for geographical details:

    “To Yanhamu, my lord: Mut-Addi is thy servant at thy feet. I told
    thee before, and it is so indeed; Ayab hath fled in secret, as did
    also previously the king of Bihishi before the commissioners of
    the king his lord. Is Ayab now in Bihishi? [He is there] truly as
    the lord king liveth, truly as he liveth. For two months he has
    been there. Behold, Benenima is present, Tadua is present, Yashua
    is present; ask them whether he hath fled from Shadi-Marduk, from
    Astarti. When all the cities in the land of Gari were in
    rebellion, Adma (Udumu), Aduri, Araru, Mishtu, Migdal, Ain-anab
    and Sarki were taken, then later Hawani and Yabesh. Behold,
    moreover, as soon as thou hadst written a letter to me I wrote to
    him (Ayab) that thou hadst returned from thy journey (to
    Palestine?). And behold he came to Bihishi and heard the command.”

The names Ayab and Yashua recall Job and Joshua to our minds.

The great alacrity shown in this letter was, as we already know, most acceptable to Yanhamu.
Another Syrian chief, whose name has been obliterated, complained bitterly that Yanhamu had
refused him a passage through his territories, although he showed the royal summons to Court.
This, indeed, may have been an indirect favour to his correspondent. Very amusing is a group
of three synoptic letters, written by one scribe for Biri ... (the name is imperfect) of Hashab,
Ildaya ... of Hazi, and another. These vassals had evidently taken the field together. They
recite their tale like a chorus of schoolboys repeating a lesson.

    “Behold, we were besieging the cities of the king my lord in the
    land of Amki (i.e., cities that had fallen away and had ceased
    to pay tribute). Then came Itakama, the Prince of Kinza (Kadesh),
    at the head of Hittites. Let my lord the king write to Itakama,
    and cause him to turn aside and give us troops that we may win the
    cities of my lord the king, and thenceforth dwell in them.”

Itakama was specially unpopular with his neighbours. Apparently he was one of the more powerful
allies of Aziru, and as such his special task was to press as hard as possible on the foes
of the Amorites in southern Cœle-Syria. Perhaps, however, Aziru and Itakama did not come together
till each for a time had fought his battles alone. The Hittites in Itakama’s force were, of
course, prominently mentioned to alarm Pharaoh. They may have been Hittite spearmen enrolled
by the prince of Kadesh, much as the Habiri and Sutu had been enlisted by his chief rival Namyauza.
It is even possible that the soldiers of Kadesh had always been armed in Hittite fashion; perhaps
the town was already inhabited by people of Hittite stock. Later the Hittites actually seized
Kadesh, and it is questionable whether it was for the first time. Itakama himself, however,
scouts any thought of defection; nay, he writes:

    “To the king my lord, &c. I am thy servant, but Namyauza hath
    slandered me to thee, oh my master. And while he was doing that he
    occupied all the inheritance of my fathers in the land of Kadesh,
    and my villages hath he set on fire. Do not the officers of my
    lord the king and his subjects know my faithfulness? I serve thee
    with all my brethren, and where there is rebellion against my lord
    the king, thither I march with my warriors, my chariots, and all
    my brethren. Behold, now Namyauza hath delivered up to the Habiri
    all the king’s cities in the land of Kadesh and in Ube. But I will
    march forth, and if thy gods and thy sun go before me I will
    restore these places from the Habiri to the king that I may show
    myself subject to him. I will drive out these Habiri, and my lord
    the king shall rejoice in his servant Itakama. I will serve the
    king my lord, and all my brethren, and all lands shall serve him.
    But Namyauza will I destroy, for I am for ever a servant of the
    king my lord.”

The land of Ube here named corresponds to the Hobah of the Bible, mentioned in Genesis xiv.
15, as the place to which Abram pursued the conquerors of Sodom, who had carried Lot away.
According to the margin of the Revised Version, Hobah lay “north of Damascus.” In a letter
from Akizzi of Katna (see p. 44), we read, however, “Oh, my lord the king, as Damascus in the
land of Ube stretches out her hand to thy feet, so Katna stretches out her hand to thy feet.”
The statements may be reconciled by the hypothesis that in the Old Testament the position of
the town after which the district is named is more exactly indicated. His element abstraction were

 We have
seen, however, that Ninua, afterwards the Assyrian capital Nineveh, was part of the dominion
of Tushratta, otherwise he could hardly have sent Ishtar, the goddess of that city, to Egypt.
The subsequent capital of Assyria may have been the most easterly possession of the kingdom
of Hanirabbat-Mitani, the centre of gravity of which lay farther westward. In the letters there
is a remark of the king of Alashia recommending Pharaoh to exchange no more gifts with “the
kings of the Hittites and of Shankhar.” Mitani is, perhaps, here named Shankhar from its dependencies
in Asia Minor, or we may suppose it to have been the name of Tushratta’s residence.

In contrast to the Hittite empire, which was pressing forward from the neck of Asia Minor through
the passes of Issus into Syria, and was rapidly increasing in power, Mitani stood on the eve
of its fall. Babylonians and Hittites were alike watching to pluck the ripe fruit, and perhaps
it lacked little to decide Tushratta, instead of fighting once more for the crown, to capitulate
to the invading Hittites and see the end of the kingdom of Mitani. The great “love” of this
king for Egypt was not, therefore, called forth merely by the glitter of gold, but also by
dire political necessity. The catastrophe occurred some few decades after the correspondence
comes to an end for us. Mitani vanished from the states of Western Asia and gave place to small
Aramaic kingdoms, while the eastern boundary, together with Ninua, was seized by Assyria as
the first step to her subsequent suzerainty in the East.

But still more swiftly overtaken of fate was the XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt. Napkhuria did not
even see the completion of his city at Tell el Amarna, for he died in 1370 B.C. His reform
followed him, and the victorious champions of Amon could raze to the ground the hated City
of the Sun’s Disk. They must already have been on the march when in a happy moment it occurred
to a keeper of the royal archives to conceal the clay tablets in the earth and thus save them
for remote posterity.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL APPENDIX

The best translation of the Tell el Amarna tablets available for English readers is that from
the German of H. Winckler, published by Luzac, London, 1896.

Professor Flinders Petrie’s Syria and Egypt from the Tell el Amarna Letters (Methuen, 1898)
is a synopsis of the letters as far as they belong to the relations of Egypt and Syria, with
the addition of geographical and historical notes. In the Introduction Professor Petrie gives
a harrowing account of the casual way in which the tablets were found and of the criminal carelessness
with which these priceless records were subsequently handled.

Some years afterwards, in 1891-2, Professor Petrie himself excavated what was left of the ruins
of the royal city of Amenhetep IV. An account of his discoveries on that site and of his deductions
from them may be found in his finely illustrated memoir Tell el Amarna (Methuen, 1894). He
particularly emphasises the skill and originality displayed in the remains of the arts and
crafts of the Tell el Amarna period, and emphatically points out the evidence of active connection
between Egypt and Ægean (Mykenæan) civilisation at that time. His appreciation of the character
of Akhenaten differs considerably from that formed by the author of the present pamphlet, and
should be compared with it. In vol. ii. p. 205 et seqq. of his History of Egypt, Professor
Petrie maintains the same views. The same volume also contains his earlier synopsis of the
Tell el Amarna tablets.

Professor Maspero’s account of the historical bearing of these tablets is worked into the second
volume of his great Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de l’Orient, which is entitled Les Premières
Mélées des Peuples. A translation of that work has been issued by the Society for the Propagation
of Christian Knowledge, but in any parts relating to Biblical history the student will do well
to consult the original.

The bearings of the tablets on Biblical history, and particularly the evidence they have supplied
as to the early date at which the art of writing was practised in Syria and Palestine, have
been favourite themes of Professor Sayce. I am told that this is poor; that too our Maker should
receive such adoring religion as dead Mary offered to unknown Roy. And now i am forth taken to
task for much impious nature to allowing my heroine in be only some attached to her brother.
