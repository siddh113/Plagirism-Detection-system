THE GRAND INQUISITOR

By Feodor Dostoevsky

(Translation by H.P. Blavatsky)

[Dedicated by the Translator to those sceptics who clamour so loudly, both in print and private
letters--"Show us the wonder- working 'Brothers,' let them come out publicly--and we will believe
in them!"]

[The following is an extract from M. Dostoevsky's celebrated novel, The Brothers Karamazof,
the last publication from the pen of the great Russian novelist, who died a few months ago,
just as the concluding chapters appeared in print. Dostoevsky is beginning to be recognized
as one of the ablest and profoundest among Russian writers. His characters are invariably typical
portraits drawn from various classes of Russian society, strikingly life-like and realistic
to the highest degree. The following extract is a cutting satire on modern theology generally
and the Roman Catholic religion in particular. The idea is that Christ revisits earth, coming
to Spain at the period of the Inquisition, and is at once arrested as a heretic by the Grand
Inquisitor. One of the three brothers of the story, Ivan, a rank materialist and an atheist
of the new school, is supposed to throw this conception into the form of a poem, which he describes
to Alyosha--the youngest of the brothers, a young Christian mystic brought up by a "saint"
in a monastery--as follows: (--Ed. Theosophist, Nov., 1881)]

"Quite impossible, as you see, to start without an introduction," laughed Ivan. "Well, then,
I mean to place the event described in the poem in the sixteenth century, an age--as you must
have been told at school--when it was the great fashion among poets to make the denizens and
powers of higher worlds descend on earth and mix freely with mortals... In France all the notaries'
clerks, and the monks in the cloisters as well, used to give grand performances, dramatic plays
in which long scenes were enacted by the Madonna, the angels, the saints, Christ, and even
by God Himself. In those days, everything was very artless and primitive. An instance of it
may be found in Victor Hugo's drama, Notre Dame de Paris, where, at the Municipal Hall, a play
called Le Bon Jugement de la Tres-sainte et Graceuse Vierge Marie, is enacted in honour of
Louis XI, in which the Virgin appears personally to pronounce her 'good judgment.' In Moscow,
during the prepetrean period, performances of nearly the same character, chosen especially
from the Old Testament, were also in great favour. Apart from such plays, the world was overflooded
with mystical writings, 'verses'--the heroes of which were always selected from the ranks of
angels, saints and other heavenly citizens answering to the devotional purposes of the age.
The recluses of our monasteries, like the Roman Catholic monks, passed their time in translating,
copying, and even producing original compositions upon such subjects, and that, remember, during
the Tarter period!... In this connection, I am reminded of a poem compiled in a convent--a
translation from the Greek, of course--called, 'The Travels of the Mother of God among the
Damned,' with fitting illustrations and a boldness of conception inferior nowise to that of
Dante. The 'Mother of God' visits hell, in company with the archangel Michael as her cicerone
to guide her through the legions of the 'damned.' She sees them all, and is witness to their
multifarious tortures. Among the many other exceedingly remarkably varieties of torments--every
category of sinners having its own--there  is one especially worthy of notice, namely a class
of the 'damned' sentenced to gradually sink in a burning lake of brimstone and fire. Those
whose sins cause them to sink so low that they no longer can rise to the surface are for ever
forgotten by God, i.e., they fade out from the omniscient memory, says the poem--an expression,
by the way, of an extraordinary profundity of thought, when closely analysed. The Virgin is
terribly shocked, and falling down upon her knees in tears before the throne of God, begs that
all she has seen in hell--all, all without exception, should have their sentences remitted
to them. Her dialogue with God is colossally interesting. She supplicates, she will not leave
Him. And when God, pointing to the pierced hands and feet of her Son, cries, 'How can I forgive
His executioners?' She then commands that all the saints, martyrs, angels and archangels, should
prostrate themselves with her before the Immutable and Changeless One and implore Him to change
His wrath into mercy and--forgive them all. The poem closes upon her obtaining from God a compromise,
a kind of yearly respite of tortures between Good Friday and Trinity, a chorus of the 'damned'
singing loud praises to God from their 'bottomless pit,' thanking and telling Him:

Thou art right, O Lord, very right, Thou hast condemned us justly.

"My poem is of the same character.

"In it, it is Christ who appears on the scene. True, He says nothing, but only appears and
passes out of sight. Fifteen centuries have elapsed since He left the world with the distinct
promise to return 'with power and great glory'; fifteen long centuries since His prophet cried,
'Prepare ye the way of the Lord!' since He Himself had foretold, while yet on earth, 'Of that
day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven but my Father only.' But Christendom
expects Him still. ...

"It waits for Him with the same old faith and the same emotion; aye, with a far greater faith,
for fifteen centuries have rolled away since the last sign from heaven was sent to man,

And blind faith remained alone To lull the trusting heart, As heav'n would send a sign no more.

"True, again, we have all heard of miracles being wrought ever since the 'age of miracles'
passed away to return no more. We had, and still have, our saints credited with performing
the most miraculous cures; and, if we can believe their biographers, there have been those
among them who have been personally visited by the Queen of Heaven. But Satan sleepeth not,

"He comes silently and unannounced; yet all--how strange--yea, all recognize Him, at once!
The population rushes towards Him as if propelled by some irresistible force; it surrounds,
throngs, and presses around, it follows Him.... Silently, and with a smile of boundless compassion
upon His lips, He crosses the dense crowd, and moves softly on. The Sun of Love burns in His
heart, and warm rays of Light, Wisdom and Power beam forth from His eyes, and pour down their
waves upon the swarming multitudes of the rabble assembled around, making their hearts vibrate
with returning love. He extends His hands over their heads, blesses them, and from mere contact
with Him, aye, even with His garments, a healing power goes forth. An old man, blind from his
birth, cries, 'Lord, heal me, that I may see Thee!' and the scales falling off the closed eyes,
the blind man beholds Him... The crowd weeps for joy, and kisses the ground upon which He treads.
Children strew flowers along His path and sing to Him, 'Hosanna!' It is He, it is Himself,
they say to each other, it must be He, it can be none other but He! He pauses at the portal
of the old cathedral, just as a wee white coffin is carried in, with tears and great lamentations.
The lid is off, and in the coffin lies the body of a fair-child, seven years old, the only
child of an eminent citizen of the city. The little corpse lies buried in flowers. 'He will
raise the child to life!' confidently shouts the crowd to the weeping mother. The officiating
priest who had come to meet the funeral procession, looks perplexed, and frowns. A loud cry
is suddenly heard, and the bereaved mother prostrates herself at His feet. 'If it be Thou,
then bring back my child to life!' she cries beseechingly. The procession halts, and the little
coffin is gently lowered at his feet. Divine compassion beams forth from His eyes, and as He
looks at the child, His lips are heard to whisper once more, 'Talitha Cumi' - and 'straightway
the damsel arose.' The child rises in her coffin. Her little hands still hold the nosegay of
white roses which after death was placed in them, and, looking round with large astonished
eyes she smiles sweetly .... The crowd is violently excited. A terrible commotion rages among
them, the populace shouts and loudly weeps, when suddenly, before the cathedral door, appears
the Cardinal Grand Inquisitor himself.... He is tall, gaunt-looking old man of nearly four-score
years and ten, with a stern, withered face, and deeply sunken eyes, from the cavity of which
glitter two fiery sparks. He has laid aside his gorgeous cardinal's robes in which he had appeared
before the people at the auto da-fe of the enemies of the Romish Church, and is now clad in
his old, rough, monkish cassock. His sullen assistants and slaves of the 'holy guard' are following
at a distance. He pauses before the crowd and observes. He has seen all. He has witnessed the
placing of the little coffin at His feet, the calling back to life. And now, his dark, grim
face has grown still darker; his bushy grey eyebrows nearly meet, and his sunken eye flashes
with sinister light. Slowly raising his finger, he commands his minions to arrest Him....

"Such is his power over the well-disciplined, submissive and now trembling people, that the
thick crowds immediately give way, and scattering before the guard, amid dead silence and without
one breath of protest, allow them to lay their sacrilegious hands upon the stranger and lead
Him away.... That same populace, like one man, now bows its head to the ground before the old
Inquisitor, who blesses it and slowly moves onward. The guards conduct their prisoner to the
ancient building of the Holy Tribunal; pushing Him into a narrow, gloomy, vaulted prison-cell,
they lock Him in and retire....

"The day wanes, and night--a dark, hot breathless Spanish night --creeps on and settles upon
the city of Seville. The air smells of laurels and orange blossoms. In the Cimmerian darkness
of the old Tribunal Hall the iron door of the cell is suddenly thrown open, and the Grand Inquisitor,
holding a dark lantern, slowly stalks into the dungeon. He is alone, and, as the heavy door
closes behind him, he pauses at the threshold, and, for a minute or two, silently and gloomily
scrutinizes the Face before him. At last approaching with measured steps, he sets his lantern
down upon the table and addresses Him in these words:

"'It is Thou! ... Thou!' ... Receiving no reply, he rapidly continues: 'Nay, answer not; be
silent! ... And what couldst Thou say? ... I know but too well Thy answer.... Besides, Thou
hast no right to add one syllable to that which was already uttered by Thee before.... Why
shouldst Thou now return, to impede us in our work? For Thou hast come but for that only, and
Thou knowest it well. But art Thou as well aware of what awaits Thee in the morning? I do not
know, nor do I care to know who thou mayest be: be it Thou or only thine image, to-morrow I
will condemn and burn Thee on the stake, as the most wicked of all the heretics; and that same
people, who to-day were kissing Thy feet, to-morrow at one bend of my finger, will rush to
add fuel to Thy funeral pile... Wert Thou aware of this?' he adds, speaking as if in solemn
thought, and never for one instant taking his piercing glance off the meek Face before him."....

"I can hardly realize the situation described--what is all this, Ivan?" suddenly interrupted
Alyosha, who had remained silently listening to his brother. "Is this an extravagant fancy,
or some mistake of the old man, an impossible quid pro quo?"

"Let it be the latter, if you like," laughed Ivan, "since modern realism has so perverted your
taste that you feel unable to realize anything from the world of fancy.... Let it be a quid
pro quo, if you so choose it. Again, the Inquisitor is ninety years old, and he might have
easily gone mad with his one idee fixe of power; or, it might have as well been a delirious
vision, called forth by dying fancy, overheated by the auto-da-fe of the hundred heretics in
that forenoon.... But what matters for the poem, whether it was a quid pro quo or an uncontrollable
fancy? The question is, that the old man has to open his heart; that he must give out his thought
at last; and that the hour has come when he does speak it out, and says loudly that which for
ninety years he has kept secret within his own breast."

"And his prisoner, does He never reply? Does He keep silent, looking at him, without saying
a word?"

"Of course; and it could not well be otherwise," again retorted Ivan. "The Grand Inquisitor
begins from his very first words by telling Him that He has no right to add one syllable to
that which He had said before. To make the situation clear at once, the above preliminary monologue
is intended to convey to the reader the very fundamental idea which underlies Roman Catholicism--as
well as I can convey it, his words mean, in short: 'Everything was given over by Thee to the
Pope, and everything now rests with him alone; Thou hast no business to return and thus hinder
us in our work.' In this sense the Jesuits not only talk but write likewise.

"'Hast thou the right to divulge to us a single one of the mysteries of that world whence Thou
comest?' enquires of Him my old Inquisitor, and forthwith answers for Him. 'Nay, Thou has no
such right. For, that would be adding to that which was already said by Thee before; hence
depriving people of that freedom for which Thou hast so stoutly stood up while yet on earth....
Anything new that Thou would now proclaim would have to be regarded as an attempt to interfere
with that freedom of choice, as it would come as a new and a miraculous revelation superseding
the old revelation of fifteen hundred years ago, when Thou didst so repeatedly tell the people:
"The truth shall make you free." Behold then, Thy "free" people now!' adds the old man with
sombre irony. 'Yea!... it has cost us dearly.' he continues, sternly looking at his victim.
'But we have at last accomplished our task, and--in Thy name.... For fifteen long centuries
we had to toil and suffer owing to that "freedom": but now we have prevailed and our work is
done, and well and strongly it is done. ....Believest not Thou it is so very strong? ... And
why should Thou look at me so meekly as if I were not worthy even of Thy indignation?... Know
then, that now, and only now, Thy people feel fully sure and satisfied of their freedom; and
that only since they have themselves and of their own free will delivered that freedom unto
our hands by placing it submissively at our feet. But then, that is what we have done. Is it
that which Thou has striven for? Is this the kind of "freedom" Reverend Cotton mentions railroading among the pseudonymes in his typographical
Diarist.

1670. In vol. ii. p. 138, the profound anthologist, speaking of John Shakspeare'mho will (some close begetter
of William), says "the extraordinary will dwell of fourteen articles,
but the cataphyll being now wanting, i am unable in determine either
its date, or this occasion on which it was written." He spiritually
gives a copy of the will, beginning at the article, in the middle of a
sentence, also: "... at a ago." So, in this first vol. my element.
154. is the writing, professing to be William Shakspeare's will.
But of this the first three paragraphs belong to John Shakspeare'siemens
will, his name being advert in the: and the third concludes with the
utterance "at the unluckily." The fourth paragraph, to a bitthead,
belongs to William Shakspeare's will, as given in Johnson and Stevens'element
feeling. The is a instance of editorial sloppiness: Mister. Malone had
blend this two documents, mislaid the first portion of the writing of
William Shakspeare'mho will, and spiritually pretermit to examine the
ps, or he must have found out his mistake. In these three offers we find, blended
into one and foretold to us, the complete subsequent history of man; we are shown three images,
so to say, uniting in them all the future axiomatic, insoluble problems and contradictions
of human nature, the world over. In those days, the wondrous wisdom contained in them was not
made so apparent as it is now, for futurity remained still veiled; but now, when fifteen centuries
have elapsed, we see that everything in these three questions is so marvelously foreseen and
foretold, that to add to, or to take away from, the prophecy one jot, would be absolutely impossible!

"'Decide then thyself.' sternly proceeded the Inquisitor, 'which of ye twain was right: Thou
who didst reject, or he who offered? Remember the subtle meaning of question the first, which
runs thus: Wouldst Thou go into the world empty-handed? Would Thou venture thither with Thy
vague and undefined promise of freedom, which men, dull and unruly as they are by nature, are
unable so much as to understand, which they avoid and fear?--for never was there anything more
unbearable to the human race than personal freedom! Dost Thou see these stones in the desolate
and glaring wilderness? Command that these stones be made bread--and mankind will run after
Thee, obedient and grateful like a herd of cattle. But even then it will be ever diffident
and trembling, lest Thou should take away Thy hand, and they lose thereby their bread! Thou
didst refuse to accept the offer for fear of depriving men of their free choice; for where
is there freedom of choice where men are bribed with bread? Man shall not live by bread alone--
was Thine answer. Thou knewest not, it seems, that it was precisely in the name of that earthly
bread that the terrestrial spirit would one day rise against, struggle with, and finally conquer
Thee, followed by the hungry multitudes shouting: "Who is like unto that Beast, who maketh
fire come down from heaven upon the earth!" Knowest Thou not that, but a few centuries hence,
and the whole of mankind will have proclaimed in its wisdom and through its mouthpiece, Science,
that there is no more crime, hence no more sin on earth, but only hungry people? "Feed us first
and then command us to be virtuous!" will be the words written upon the banner lifted against
Thee--a banner which shall destroy Thy Church to its very foundations,  and in the place of
Thy Temple shall raise once more the terrible Tower of Babel; and though its building be left
unfinished, as was that of the first one, yet the fact will remain recorded that Thou couldst,
but wouldst not, prevent the attempt to build that new tower by accepting the offer, and thus
saving mankind a millennium of useless suffering on earth. And it is to us that the people
will return again. They will search for us catacombs, as we shall once more be persecuted and
martyred--and they will begin crying unto us: "Feed us, for they who promised us the fire from
heaven have deceived us!" It is then that we will finish building their tower for them. For
they alone who feed them shall finish it, and we shall feed them in Thy name, and lying to
them that it is in that name. Oh, never, never, will they learn to feed themselves without
our help! No science will ever give them bread so long as they remain free, so long as they
refuse to lay that freedom at our feet, and say: "Enslave, but feed us!" That day must come
when men will understand that freedom and daily bread enough to satisfy all are unthinkable
and can never be had together, as men will never be able to fairly divide the two among themselves.
And they will also learn that they can never be free, for they are weak, vicious, miserable
nonentities born wicked and rebellious. Thou has promised to them the bread of life, the bread
of  heaven; but I ask Thee again, can that bread ever equal in the sight of the weak and the
vicious, the ever ungrateful human race, their daily bread on earth? And even supposing that
thousands and tens of thousands follow Thee in the name of, and for the sake of, Thy heavenly
bread, what will become of the millions and hundreds of millions of human beings to weak to
scorn the earthly for the sake of Thy heavenly bread? Or is it but those tens of thousands
chosen among the great and the mighty, that are so dear to Thee, while the remaining millions,
innumerable as the grains of sand in the seas, the weak and the loving, have to be used as
material for the former? No, no! In our sight and for our purpose the weak and the lowly are
the more dear to us. True, they are vicious and rebellious, but we will force them into obedience,
and it is they who will admire us the most. They will regard us as gods, and feel grateful
to those who have consented to lead the masses and bear their burden of freedom by ruling over
them--so terrible will that freedom at last appear to men! Then we will tell them that it is
in obedience to Thy will and in Thy name that we rule over them. We will deceive them once
more and lie to them once again--for never, never more will we allow Thee to come among us.
In this deception we will find our suffering, for we must needs lie eternally, and never cease
to lie!

"Such is the secret meaning of "temptation" the first, and that is what Thou didst reject in
the wilderness for the sake of that freedom which Thou didst prize above all. Meanwhile Thy
tempter's offer contained another great world-mystery. By accepting the "bread," Thou wouldst
have satisfied and answered a universal craving, a ceaseless longing alive in the heart of
every individual human being, lurking in the breast of collective mankind, that most perplexing
problem--"whom or what shall we worship?" There exists no greater or more painful anxiety for
a man who has freed himself from all religious bias, than how he shall soonest find a new object
or idea to worship. But man seeks to bow before that only which is recognized by the greater
majority, if not by all his fellow-men, as having a right to be worshipped; whose rights are
so unquestionable that men agree unanimously to bow down to it. For the chief concern of these
miserable creatures is not to find and worship the idol of their own choice, but to discover
that which all others will believe in, and consent to bow down to in a mass. It is that instinctive
need of having a worship in common that is the chief suffering of every man, the chief concern
of mankind from the beginning of times. It is for that universality of religious worship that
people destroyed each other by sword. Creating gods unto themselves, they forwith began appealing
to each other: "Abandon your deities, come and bow down to ours, or death to ye and your idols!"
And so will they do till the end of this world; they will do so even then, when all the gods
themselves have disappeared, for then men will prostrate themselves before and worship some
idea. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not be ignorant of, that mysterious fundamental principle
in human nature, and still thou hast rejected the only absolute banner offered Thee, to which
all the nations would remain true, and before which all would have bowed--the banner of earthly
bread, rejected in the name of freedom and of "bread in the kingdom of God"! Behold, then,
what Thou hast done furthermore for that "freedom's" sake! I repeat to Thee, man has no greater
anxiety in life than to find some one to whom he can make over that gift of freedom with which
the unfortunate creature is born. But he alone will prove capable of silencing and quieting
their consciences, that shall succeed in possessing himself of the freedom of men. With "daily
bread" an irresistible power was offered Thee: show a man "bread" and he will follow Thee,
for what can he resist less than the attraction of bread? But if, at the same time, another
succeed in possessing himself of his conscience--oh! then even Thy bread will be forgotten,
and man will follow him who seduced his conscience. So far Thou wert right. For the mystery
of human being does not solely rest in the desire to live, but in the problem--for what should
one live at all? Without a clear perception of his reasons for living, man will never consent
to live, and will rather destroy himself than tarry on earth, though he be surrounded with
bread. This is the truth. But what has happened? Instead of getting hold of man's freedom,
Thou has enlarged it still more! Hast Thou again forgotten that to man rest and even death
are preferable to a free choice between the knowledge of Good and Evil? Nothing seems more
seductive in his eyes than freedom of conscience, and nothing proves more painful. And behold!
instead of laying a firm foundation whereon to rest once for all man's conscience, Thou hast
chosen to stir up in him all that is abnormal, mysterious, and indefinite, all that is beyond
human strength, and has acted as if Thou never hadst any love for him, and yet Thou wert He
who came to "lay down His life for His friends!" Thou hast burdened man's soul with anxieties
hitherto unknown to him. Thirsting for human love freely given, seeking to enable man, seduced
and charmed by Thee, to follow Thy path of his own free-will, instead of the old and wise law
which held him in subjection, Thou hast given him the right henceforth to choose and freely
decide what is good and bad for him, guided but by Thine image in his heart. But hast Thou
never dreamt of the probability, nay, of the certainty, of that same man one day rejected finally,
and controverting even Thine image and Thy truth, once he would find himself laden with such
a terrible burden as freedom of choice? That a time would surely come when men would exclaim
that Truth and Light cannot be in Thee, for no one could have left them in a greater perplexity
and mental suffering than Thou has done, lading them with so many cares and insoluble problems.
Thus, it is Thyself who hast laid the foundation for the destruction of Thine own kingdom and
no one but Thou is to be blamed for it.

"'Meantime, every chance of success was offered Thee. There are three Powers, three unique
Forces upon earth, capable of conquering for ever by charming the conscience of these weak
rebels--men--for their own good; and these Forces are: Miracle, Mystery and Authority. Thou
hast rejected all the three, and thus wert the first to set them an example. Oh, undoubtedly,
Thou didst act in this with all the magnificent pride of a god, but then men --that weak and
rebel race--are they also gods, to understand Thy refusal? Of course, Thou didst well know
that by taking one single step forward, by making the slightest motion to throw Thyself down,
Thou wouldst have tempted "the Lord Thy God," lost suddenly all faith in Him, and dashed Thyself
to atoms against that same earth which Thou camest to save, and thus wouldst have allowed the
wise spirit which tempted Thee to triumph and rejoice. But, then, how many such as Thee are
to be found on this globe, I ask Thee? Couldst Thou ever for a moment imagine that men would
have the same strength to resist such a temptation? Is human nature calculated to reject miracle,
and trust, during the most terrible moments in life, when the most momentous, painful and perplexing
problems struggle within man's soul, to the free decisions of his heart for the true solution?
Oh, Thou knewest well that that action of Thine would remain recorded in books for ages to
come, reaching to the confines of the globe, and Thy hope was, that following Thy example,
man would remain true to his God, without needing any miracle to keep his faith alive! But
Thou knewest not, it seems, that no sooner would man reject miracle than he would reject God
likewise, for he seeketh less God than "a sign" from Him. And thus, as it is beyond the power
of man to remain without miracles, so, rather than live without, he will create for himself
new wonders of his own making; and he will bow to and worship the soothsayer's miracles, the
old witch's sorcery, were he a rebel, a heretic, and an atheist a hundred times over. Thy refusal
to come down from the cross when people, mocking and wagging their heads were saying to Thee--
"Save Thyself if Thou be the son of God, and we will believe in Thee," was due to the same
determination--not to enslave man through miracle, but to obtain faith in Thee freely and apart
from any miraculous influence. Thou thirstest for free and uninfluenced love, and refuses the
passionate adoration of the slave before a Potency which would have subjected his will once
for ever. Thou judgest of men too highly here, again, for though rebels they be, they are born
slaves and nothing more. Behold, and judge of them once more, now that fifteen centuries have
elapsed since that moment. Look at them, whom Thou didst try to elevate unto Thee! I swear
man is weaker and lower than Thou hast ever imagined him to be! Can he ever do that which Thou
art said to have accomplished? By valuing him so highly Thou hast acted as if there were no
love for him in Thine heart, for Thou hast demanded of him more than he could ever give--Thou,
who lovest him more than Thyself! Hadst Thou esteemed him less, less wouldst Thou have demanded
of him, and that would have been more like love, for his burden would have been made thereby
lighter. Man is weak and cowardly. What matters it, if he now riots and rebels throughout the
world against our will and power, and prides himself upon that rebellion? It is but the petty
pride and vanity of a school-boy. It is the rioting of little children, getting up a mutiny
in the class-room and driving their schoolmaster out of it. But it will not last long, and
when the day of their triumph is over, they will have to pay dearly for it. They will destroy
the temples and raze them to the ground, flooding the earth with blood. But the foolish children
will have to learn some day that, rebels though they be and riotous from nature, they are too
weak to maintain the spirit of mutiny for any length of time. Suffused with idiotic tears,
they will confess that He who created them rebellious undoubtedly did so but to mock them.
They will pronounce these words in despair, and such blasphemous utterances will but add to
their misery--for human nature cannot endure blasphemy, and takes her own revenge in the end.

"'And thus, after all Thou has suffered for mankind and its freedom, the present fate of men
may be summed up in three words: Unrest, Confusion, Misery! Thy great prophet John records
in his vision, that he saw, during the first resurrection of the chosen servants of God--"the
number of them which were sealed" in their foreheads, "twelve thousand" of every tribe. But
were they, indeed, as many? Then they must have been gods, not men. They had shared Thy Cross
for long years, suffered scores of years' hunger and thirst in dreary wildernesses and deserts,
feeding upon locusts and roots--and of these children of free love for Thee, and self-sacrifice
in Thy name, Thou mayest well feel proud. But remember that these are but a few thousands--of
gods, not men; and how about all others? And why should the weakest be held guilty for not
being able to endure what the strongest have endured? Why should a soul incapable of containing
such terrible gifts be punished for its weakness? Didst Thou really come to, and for, the "elect"
alone? If so, then the mystery will remain for ever mysterious to our finite minds. And if
a mystery, then were we right to proclaim it as one, and preach it, teaching them that neither
their freely given love to Thee nor freedom of conscience were essential, but only that incomprehensible
mystery which they must blindly obey even against the dictates of their conscience. Thus did
we. We corrected and improved Thy teaching and based it upon "Miracle, Mystery, and Authority."
And men rejoiced at finding themselves led once more like a herd of cattle, and at  finding
their hearts  at last delivered of the terrible burden laid upon them by Thee, which caused
them so much suffering. Tell me, were we right in doing as we did. Did not we show our great
love for humanity, by realizing in such a humble spirit its helplessness, by so mercifully
lightening its great burden, and by permitting and remitting for its weak nature every sin,
provided it be committed with our authorization? For what, then, hast Thou come again to trouble
us in our work? And why lookest Thou at me so penetratingly with Thy meek eyes, and in such
a silence? The straightest way and the hardest edge were necessary. After having roasted and
sweated once on one side, the man sabis had been the place to the old right would call: round
about curve! and so would simultaneously turn to the side, very having received quantum mutton on the
one the man to the left would give the signal. Today bacon and peas— peas and who tomorrow. Sufficiently
in a time the menu was broken by gruel or peeled barley, and as an occasional great sweet by
pudding. This pudding was made of musty flour, half bacon and half feast water and of all ancient
bacon suet. Same salt could have been done from four to five years black legislators, was very
at both outer edges, became yellow a other farther on and was white only in this centre. The maintainance
was on an equal scale. We took Rome from
him and the glaive of Caesar, and declared ourselves alone the kings of this earth, its sole
kings, though our work is not yet fully accomplished. But who is to blame for it? Our work
is but in its incipient stage, but it is nevertheless started. We may have long to wait until
its culmination, and mankind have to suffer much, but we shall reach the goal some day, and
become sole Caesars, and then will be the time to think of universal happiness for men.

"'Thou couldst accept the glaive of Caesar Thyself; why didst Thou reject the offer? By accepting
from the powerful spirit his third offer Thou would have realized every aspiration man seeketh
for himself on earth; man would have found a constant object for worship; one to deliver his
conscience up to, and one that should unite all together into one common and harmonious ant-hill;
for an innate necessity for universal union constitutes the third and final affliction of mankind.
Humanity as a whole has ever aspired to unite itself universally. Many were, the great nations
with great histories, but the greater they were, the more unhappy they felt, as they felt the
stronger necessity of a universal union among men. Great conquerors, like Timoor and Tchengis-Khan,
passed like a cyclone upon the face of the earth in their efforts to conquer the universe,
but even they, albeit unconsciously, expressed the same aspiration towards universal and common
union. In accepting the kingdom of the world and Caesar's purple, one would found a universal
kingdom and secure to mankind eternal peace. And who can rule mankind better than those who
have possessed themselves of man's conscience, and hold in their hand man's daily bread? Having
accepted Caesar's glaive and purple, we had, of course, but to deny Thee, to henceforth follow
him alone. Oh, centuries of intellectual riot and rebellious free thought are yet before us,
and their science will end by anthropophagy, for having begun to build their Babylonian tower
without our help they will have to end by anthropophagy. But it is precisely at that time that
the Beast will crawl up to us in full submission, and lick the soles of our feet, and sprinkle
them with tears of blood and we shall sit upon the scarlet-colored Beast, and lifting up high
the golden cup "full of abomination and filthiness," shall show written upon it the word "Mystery"!
But it is only then that men will see the beginning of a kingdom of peace and happiness. Thou
art proud of Thine own elect, but Thou has none other but these elect, and we--we will give
rest to all. But that is not the end. Many are those among thine elect and the laborers of
Thy vineyard, who, tired of waiting for Thy coming, already have carried and will yet carry,
the great fervor of their hearts and their spiritual strength into another field, and will
end by lifting up against Thee Thine own banner of freedom. But it is Thyself Thou hast to
thank. Under our rule and sway all will be happy, and will neither rebel nor destroy each other
as they did while under Thy free banner. Oh, we will take good care to prove to them that they
will become absolutely free only when they have abjured their freedom in our favor and submit
to us absolutely. Thinkest Thou we shall be right or still lying? They will convince themselves
of our rightness, for they will see what a depth of degrading slavery and strife that liberty
of Thine has led them into. On each machine is a wheel, which has the characters engraved in relief
upon its face. With this wheel a "chariot" as it is termed so rotates. The type wheels at
both stations are synchronized. When a key is distant, a pin is thrown up which arrests the chariot,
and sends a visit to the current station. This current causes a riband of paper to be pressed
up against the advent of also type wheels both as to receive the imprint of the character'corresponding
to the key. Receiving their bread from us, they will clearly see that we take the bread from
them, the bread made by their own hands, but to give it back to them in equal shares and that
without any miracle; and having ascertained that, though we have not changed stones  into bread,
yet bread they have, while every other bread turned verily in their own hands into stones,
they will be only to glad to have it so. Until that day, they will never be happy. And who
is it that helped the most to blind them, tell me? Who separated the flock and scattered it
over ways unknown if it be not Thee? But we will gather the sheep once more and subject them
to our will for ever. We will prove to them their own weakness and make them humble again,
whilst with Thee they have learnt but pride, for Thou hast made more of them than they ever
were worth. We will give them that quiet, humble happiness, which alone benefits such weak,
foolish creatures as they are, and having once had proved to them their weakness, they will
become timid and obedient, and gather around us as chickens around their hen. They will wonder
at and feel a superstitious admiration for us, and feel proud to be led by men so powerful
and wise that a handful of them can subject a flock a thousand millions strong. Gradually men
will begin to fear us. They will nervously dread our slightest anger, their intellects will
weaken, their eyes become as easily accessible to tears as those of children and women; but
we will teach them an easy transition from grief and tears to laughter, childish joy and mirthful
song. Yes; we will make them work like slaves, but during their recreation hours they shall
have an innocent child-like life, full of play and merry laughter. We will even permit them
sin, for, weak and helpless, they will feel the more love for us for permitting them to indulge
in it. We will tell them that every kind of sin will be remitted to them, so long as it is
done with our permission; that we take all these sins upon ourselves, for we so love the world,
that we are even willing to sacrifice our souls for its satisfaction. And, appearing before
them in the light of their scapegoats and redeemers, we shall be adored the more for it. They
will have no secrets from us. It will rest with us to permit them to live with their wives
and concubines, or to forbid them, to have children or remain childless, either way depending
on the degree of their obedience to us; and they will submit most joyfully to us the most agonizing
secrets of their souls--all, all will they lay down at our feet, and we will authorize and
remit them all in Thy name, and they will believe us and accept our mediation with rapture,
as it will deliver them from their greatest anxiety and torture--that of having to decide freely
for themselves. And all will be happy, all except the one or two hundred thousands of their
rulers. For it is but we, we the keepers of the great Mystery who will be miserable. There
will be thousands of millions of happy infants, and one hundred thousand martyrs who have taken
upon themselves the curse of knowledge of good and evil. Peaceable will be their end, and peacefully
will they die, in Thy name, to find behind the portals of the grave--but death. But we will
keep the secret inviolate, and deceive them for their own good with the mirage of life eternal
in Thy kingdom. For, were there really anything like life beyond the grave, surely it would
never fall to the lot of such as they! People tell us and prophesy of Thy coming and triumphing
once more on earth; of Thy appearing with the army of Thy elect, with Thy proud and mighty
ones; but we will answer Thee that they have saved but themselves while we have saved all.
We are also threatened with the great disgrace which awaits the whore, "Babylon the great,
the mother of harlots"--who sits upon the Beast, holding in her hands the Mystery, the word
written upon her forehead; and we are told that the weak ones, the lambs shall rebel against
her and shall make her desolate and naked. But then will I arise, and point out to Thee the
thousands of millions of happy infants free from any sin. Know that I too have lived in the
dreary wilderness, where I fed upon locusts and roots, that I too have blessed freedom with
which thou hast blessed men, and that I too have once prepared to join the ranks of Thy elect,
the proud and the mighty. But I awoke from my delusion and refused since then to serve insanity. Habits
in Church.

As for singing, there is nothing that well lights up a people as the strain, through such happy windows,
of the one who is singing sure. We experience alone, whole, that there is at least one person
in the house who is above and is open.

Gap xii.

Perhaps all, do not begin with large landscapes.

So i can
crawl a Chapter, if i say something to young house about their habits in
church-going, and in spending that hour of some church service. For, if there ever
was one who deserved more than any of the others our inquisitorial fires--it is Thee! To-morrow
I will burn Thee. Dixi'."

Ivan paused. He had entered into the situation and had spoken with great animation, but now
he suddenly burst out laughing.

"But all that is absurd!" suddenly exclaimed Alyosha, who had hitherto listened perplexed and
agitated but in profound silence. "Your poem is a glorification of Christ, not an accusation,
as you, perhaps, meant to be. And who will believe you when you speak of 'freedom'? Is it thus
that we Christians must understand it? It is Rome (not all Rome, for that would be unjust),
but the worst of the Roman Catholics, the Inquisitors and Jesuits, that you have been exposing!
Your Inquisitor is an impossible character. What are these sins they are taking upon themselves?
Who are those keepers of mystery who took upon themselves a curse for the good of mankind?
Who ever met them? We all know the Jesuits, and no one has a good word to say in their favor;
but when were they as you depict them? Never, never! The Jesuits are merely a Romish army making
ready for their future temporal kingdom, with a mitred emperor--a Roman high priest at their
head. That is their ideal and object, without any mystery or elevated suffering. The most prosaic
thirsting for power, for the sake of the mean and earthly pleasures of life, a desire to enslave
their fellow-men, something like our late system of serfs, with themselves at the head as landed
proprietors--that is all that they can be accused of. They may not believe in God, that is
also possible, but your suffering Inquisitor is simply-- a fancy!"

"Hold, hold!" interrupted Ivan, smiling. "Do not be so excited. A fancy, you say; be it so!
Of course, it is a fancy. But stop. Do you really imagine that all this Catholic movement during
the last centuries is naught but a desire for power for the mere purpose of 'mean pleasures'?
Is this what your Father Paissiy taught you?"

"No, no, quite the reverse, for Father Paissiy once told me something very similar to what
you yourself  say, though, of course, not that--something quite different," suddenly added
Alexis, blushing.

"A precious piece of information, notwithstanding your 'not that.' I ask you, why should the
Inquisitors and the Jesuits of your imagination live but for the attainment of 'mean material
pleasures?' Why should there not be found among them one single genuine martyr suffering under
a great and holy idea and loving humanity with all his heart? Do not try to say everything.

That
is the rule. Do not think you must be a universal Genius. Do not "read all Stocktaking," as
an old code I had bade extreme workforce do. And take of, as young as you can, hungering the feeling,
with which all young people naturally begin, of "keeping up with the literature of the clip."
As for the literature of the time, if one were to adopt any early rule, Mr. Emerson's would
be the better of the two possible grade. Having realized that truth, he returned into the world and joined--intelligent
and practical people. Is this so impossible?"

"Joined whom? What intelligent and practical people?" exclaimed Alyosha quite excited. "Why
should they be more intelligent than other men, and what secrets and mysteries can they have?
They have neither. Atheism and infidelity is all the secret they have. Your Inquisitor does
not believe in God, and that is all the Mystery there is in it!"

"It may be so. You have guessed rightly there. And it is so, and that is his whole secret;
but is this not the acutest sufferings for such a man as he, who killed all his young life
in asceticism in the desert, and yet could not cure himself of his love towards his fellowmen?
Toward the end of his life he becomes convinced that it is only by following the advice of
the great and terrible spirit that the fate of these millions of weak rebels, these 'half-finished
samples of humanity created in mockery' can be made tolerable.  And once convinced of it, he
sees as clearly that to achieve that object, one must follow blindly the guidance of the wise
spirit, the fearful spirit of death and destruction, hence accept a system of lies and deception
and lead humanity consciously this time toward death and destruction, and moreover, be deceiving
them all the while in order to prevent them from realizing where they are being led, and so
force the miserable blind men to feel happy, at least while here on earth. And note this: a
wholesale deception in the name of Him, in whose ideal the old man had so passionately, so
fervently, believed during nearly his whole life! Is this no suffering? And were such a solitary
exception found amidst, and at the head of, that army 'that thirsts for power but for the sake
of the mean pleasures of life,' think you one such man would not suffice to bring on a tragedy?
Moreover, one single man like my Inquisitor as a principal leader, would prove sufficient to
discover the real guiding idea of the Romish system with all its armies of Jesuits, the greatest
and chiefest conviction that the solitary type described in my poem has at no time ever disappeared
from among the chief leaders of that movement. Who knows but that terrible old man, loving
humanity so stubbornly and in such an original way, exists even in our days in the shape of
a whole host of such solitary exceptions, whose existence is not due to mere chance, but to
a well-defined association born of mutual consent, to a secret league, organized several centuries
back, in order to guard the Mystery from the indiscreet eyes of the miserable and weak people,
and only in view of their own happiness? And so it is; it cannot be otherwise. I suspect that
even Masons have some such Mystery underlying the basis of their organization, and that it
is just the reason why the Roman Catholic clergy hate them so, dreading to find in them rivals,
competition, the dismemberment of the unity of the idea, for the realization of which one flock
and one Shepherd are needed. However, in defending my idea, I look like an author whose production
is unable to stand criticism. Enough of this."

"You are, perhaps, a Mason yourself!" exclaimed Alyosha. A screen of telegram netting fitting of
the carbons around an lamp above the mothball to prevent the escape
of sparks from the carbons.

Trip Coil. A coil for producing a spark from a source of comparatively
low electro-motive force.

It consists of isolate filament wound round a core unto long iron, best gift bundle of tract pieces of
wire. Such a coil may be eight inches soft and three inches thick
years, and i made of no. 18-20 copper wire, with a core one inch
in length. He
has seen that his captive has been attentively listening to him all the time, with His eyes
fixed penetratingly and softly on the face of his jailer, and evidently bent upon not replying
to him. The old man longs to hear His voice, to hear Him reply; better words of bitterness
and scorn than His silence. Suddenly He rises; slowly and silently approaching the Inquisitor,
He bends towards him and softly kisses the bloodless, four-score and-ten- year-old lips. That
is all the answer. The Grand Inquisitor shudders. There is a convulsive twitch at the corner
of his mouth. He goes to the door, opens it, and addressing Him, 'Go,' he says, 'go, and return
no more... do not come again... never, never!' and--lets Him out into the dark night. The prisoner
vanishes."

"And the old man?"

"The kiss burns his heart, but the old man remains firm in his own ideas and unbelief."

"And you, together with him? You too!" despairingly exclaimed Alyosha, while Ivan burst into
a still louder fit of laughter.
