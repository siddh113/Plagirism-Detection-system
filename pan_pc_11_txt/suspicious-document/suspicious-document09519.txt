An Authentic Narrative of a Haunted House

[The Editor of the UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE submits the following very remarkable statement, with
every detail of which he has been for some years acquainted, upon the ground that it affords
the most authentic and ample relation of a series of marvellous phenoma, in nowise connected
with what is technically termed "spiritualism," which he has anywhere met with. All the persons--and
there are many of them living--upon whose separate evidence some parts, and upon whose united
testimony others, of this most singular recital depend, are, in their several walks of life,
respectable, and such as would in any matter of judicial investigation be deemed wholly unexceptionable
witnesses. There is not an incident here recorded which would not have been distinctly deposed
to on oath had any necessity existed, by the persons who severally, and some of them in great
fear, related their own distinct experiences. The Editor begs most pointedly to meet in limine
the suspicion, that he is elaborating a trick, or vouching for another ghost of Mrs. Veal.
As a mere story the narrative is valueless: its sole claim to attention is its absolute truth.
For the good faith of its relator he pledges his own and the character of this Magazine. With
the Editor's concurrence, the name of the watering-place, and some special circumstances in
no essential way bearing upon the peculiar character of the story, but which might have indicated
the locality, and possibly annoyed persons interested in house property there, have been suppressed
by the narrator. Not the slightest liberty has been taken with the narrative, which is presented
precisely in the terms in which the writer of it, who employs throughout the first person,
would, if need were, fix it in the form of an affidavit.]

Within the last eight years--the precise date I purposely omit--I I was ordered by my physician,
my health being in an unsatisfactory state, to change my residence to one upon the sea-coast;
and accordingly, I took a house for a year in a fashionable watering-place, at a moderate distance
from the city in which I had previously resided, and connected with it by a railway.

Winter was setting in when my removal thither was decided upon; but there was nothing whatever
dismal or depressing in the change. The house I had taken was to all appearance, and in point
of convenience, too, quite a modern one. It formed one in a cheerful row, with small gardens
in front, facing the sea, and commanding sea air and sea views in perfection. In the rear it
had coach-house and stable, and between them and the house a considerable grass-plot, with
some flower-beds, interposed.

Our family consisted of my wife and myself, with three children, the eldest about nine years
old, she and the next in age being girls; and the youngest, between six and seven, a boy. To
these were added six servants, whom, although for certain reasons I decline giving their real
names, I shall indicate, for the sake of clearness, by arbitrary ones. There was a nurse, Mrs.
Southerland; a nursery-maid, Ellen Page; the cook, Mrs. Greenwood; and the housemaid, Ellen
Faith; a butler, whom I shall call Smith, and his son, James, about two-and-twenty.

We came out to take possession at about seven o'clock in the evening; every thing was comfortable
and cheery; good fires lighted, the rooms neat and airy, and a general air of preparation and
comfort, highly conducive to good spirits and pleasant anticipations.

The sitting-rooms were large and cheerful, and they and the bed-rooms more than ordinarily
lofty, the kitchen and servants' rooms, on the same level, were well and comfortably furnished,
and had, like the rest of the house, an air of recent painting and fitting up, and a completely
modern character, which imparted a very cheerful air of cleanliness and convenience.

There had been just enough of the fuss of settling agreeably to occupy us, and to give a pleasant
turn to our thoughts after we had retired to our rooms. Being an invalid, I had a small bed
to myself--resigning the four-poster to my wife. The candle was extinguished, but a night-light
was burning. I was coming up stairs, and she, already in bed, had just dismissed her maid,
when we were both startled by a wild scream from her room; I found her in a state of the extremest
agitation and terror. She insisted that she had seen an unnaturally tall figure come beside
her bed and stand there. The light was too faint to enable her to define any thing respecting
this apparition, beyond the fact of her having most distinctly seen such a shape, colourless
from the insufficiency of the light to disclose more than its dark outline.

We both endeavoured to re-assure her. The room once more looked so cheerful in the candlelight,
that we were quite uninfluenced by the contagion of her terrors. The movements and voices of
the servants down stairs still getting things into their places and completing our comfortable
arrangements, had also their effect in steeling us against any such influence, and we set the
whole thing down as a dream, or an imperfectly-seen outline of the bed-curtains. When, however,
we were alone, my wife reiterated, still in great agitation, her clear assertion that she had
most positively seen, being at the time as completely awake as ever she was, precisely what
she had described to us. And in this conviction she continued perfectly firm.

A day or two after this, it came out that our servants were under an apprehension that, somehow
or other, thieves had established a secret mode of access to the lower part of the house. The
butler, Smith, had seen an ill-looking woman in his room on the first night of our arrival;
and he and other servants constantly saw, for many days subsequently, glimpses of a retreating
figure, which corresponded with that so seen by him, passing through a passage which led to
a back area in which were some coal-vaults.

This figure was seen always in the act of retreating, its back turned, generally getting round
the corner of the passage into the area, in a stealthy and hurried way, and, when closely followed,
imperfectly seen again entering one of the coal-vaults, and when pursued into it, nowhere to
be found.

The idea of any thing supernatural in the matter had, strange to say, not yet entered the mind
of any one of the servants. They had heard some stories of smugglers having secret passages
into houses, and using their means of access for purposes of pillage, or with a view to frighten
superstitious people out of houses which they needed for their own objects, and a suspicion
of similar practices here, caused them extreme uneasiness. The apparent anxiety also manifested
by this retreating figure to escape observation, and her always appearing to make her egress
at the same point, favoured this romantic hypothesis. The men, however, made a most careful
examination of the back area, and of the coal-vaults, with a view to discover some mode of
egress, but entirely without success. Among who submit to Tract there is not an o. To critique when he fix

 They placed the candle, as the most obvious specific, so close to the
infested wall, that the flame all but touched it; and believed for some time that they had
effectually got rid of this annoyance; but one night, notwithstanding this arrangement of the
light, the shadow returned, passing and repassing, as heretofore, upon the same wall, although
their only candle was burning within an inch of it, and it was obvious that no substance capable
of casting such a shadow could have interposed; and, indeed, as they described it, the shadow
seemed to have no sort of relation to the position of the light, and appeared, as I have said,
in manifest defiance of the laws of optics.

I ought to mention that the housemaid was a particularly fearless sort of person, as well as
a very honest one; and her companion, the cook, a scrupulously religious woman, and both agreed
in every particular in their relation of what occurred.

Meanwhile, the nursery was not without its annoyances, though as yet of a comparatively trivial
kind. Sometimes, at night, the handle of the door was turned hurriedly as if by a person trying
to come in, and at others a knocking was made at it. These sounds occurred after the children
had settled to sleep, and while the nurse still remained awake. Whenever she called to know
"who is there," the sounds ceased; but several times, and particularly at first, she was under
the impression that they were caused by her mistress, who had come to see the children, and
thus impressed she had got up and opened the door, expecting to see her, but discovering only
darkness, and receiving no answer to her inquiries.

With respect to this nurse, I must mention that I believe no more perfectly trustworthy servant
was ever employed in her capacity; and, in addition to her integrity, she was remarkably gifted
with sound common sense.

One morning, I think about three or four weeks after our arrival, I was sitting at the parlour
window which looked to the front, when I saw the little iron door which admitted into the small
garden that lay between the window where I was sitting and the public road, pushed open by
a woman who so exactly answered the description given by Smith of the woman who had visited
his room on the night of his arrival as instantaneously to impress me with the conviction that
she must be the identical person. She was a square, short woman, dressed in soiled and tattered
clothes, scarred and pitted with small-pox, and blind of an eye. She stepped hurriedly into
the little enclosure, and peered from a distance of a few yards into the room where I was sitting.
I felt that now was the moment to clear the matter up; but there was something stealthy in
the manner and look of the woman which convinced me that I must not appear to notice her until
her retreat was fairly cut off. Unfortunately, I was suffering from a lame foot, and could
not reach the bell as quickly as I wished. I made all the haste I could, and rang violently
to bring up the servant Smith. In the short interval that intervened, I observed the woman
from the window, who having in a leisurely way, and with a kind of scrutiny, looked along the
front windows of the house, passed quickly out again, closing the gate after her, and followed
a lady who was walking along the footpath at a quick pace, as if with the intention of begging
from her. The moment the man entered I told him--"the blind woman you described to me has this
instant followed a lady in that direction, try to overtake her." He was, if possible, more
eager than I in the chase, but returned in a short time after a vain pursuit, very hot, and
utterly disappointed. And, thereafter, we saw her face no more.

All this time, and up to the period of our leaving the house, which was not for two or three
months later, there occurred at intervals the only phenomenon in the entire series having any
resemblance to what we hear described of "Spiritualism." This was a knocking, like a soft hammering
with a wooden mallet, as it seemed in the timbers between the bedroom ceilings and the roof.
It had this special peculiarity, that it was always rythmical, and, I think, invariably, the
emphasis upon the last stroke. It would sound rapidly "one, two, three, four--one, two, three,
four;" or "one, two, three--one, two, three," and sometimes "one, two--one, two," &c., and
this, with intervals and resumptions, monotonously for hours at a time.

At first this caused my wife, who was a good deal confined to her bed, much annoyance; and
we sent to our neighbours to inquire if any hammering or carpentering was going on in their
houses but were informed that nothing of the sort was taking place. I have myself heard it
frequently, always in the same inaccessible part of the house, and with the same monotonous
emphasis. One odd thing about it was, that on my wife's calling out, as she used to do when
it became more than usually troublesome, "stop that noise," it was invariably arrested for
a longer or shorter time.

Of course none of these occurrences were ever mentioned in hearing of the children. They would
have been, no doubt, like most children, greatly terrified had they heard any thing of the
matter, and known that their elders were unable to account for what was passing; and their
fears would have made them wretched and troublesome.

They used to play for some hours every day in the back garden--the house forming one end of
this oblong inclosure, the stable and coach-house the other, and two parallel walls of considerable
height the sides. Here, as it afforded a perfectly safe playground, they were frequently left
quite to themselves; and in talking over their days' adventures, as children will, they happened
to mention a woman, or rather the woman, for they had long grown familiar with her appearance,
whom they used to see in the garden while they were at play. They assumed that she came in
and went out at the stable door, but they never actually saw her enter or depart. They merely
saw a figure--that of a very poor woman, soiled and ragged--near the stable wall, stooping
over the ground, and apparently grubbing in the loose clay in search of something. She did
not disturb, or appear to observe them; and they left her in undisturbed possession of her
nook of ground. When seen it was always in the same spot, and similarly occupied; and the description
they gave of her general appearance--for they never saw her face--corresponded with that of
the one-eyed woman whom Smith, and subsequently as it seemed, I had seen.

The other man, James, who looked after a mare which I had purchased for the purpose of riding
exercise, had, like every one else in the house, his little trouble to report, though it was
not much. The stall in which, as the most comfortable, it was decided to place her, she peremptorily
declined to enter. Though a very docile and gentle little animal, there was no getting her
into it. She would snort and rear, and, in fact, do or suffer any thing rather than set her
hoof in it. He was fain, therefore, to place her in another. And on several occasions he found
her there, exhibiting all the equine symptoms of extreme fear. Like the rest of us, however,
this man was not troubled in the particular case with any superstitious qualms. The mare had
evidently been frightened; and he was puzzled to find out how, or by whom, for the stable was
well-secured, and had, I am nearly certain, a lock-up yard outside.

One morning I was greeted with the intelligence that robbers had certainly got into the house
in the night; and that one of them had actually been seen in the nursery. The witness, I found,
was my eldest child, then, as I have said, about nine years of age. Having awoke in the night,
and lain awake for some time in her bed, she heard the handle of the door turn, and a person
whom she distinctly saw--for it was a light night, and the window-shutters unclosed--but whom
she had never seen before, stepped in on tiptoe, and with an appearance of great caution. He
was a rather small man, with a very red face; he wore an oddly cut frock coat, the collar of
which stood up, and trousers, rough and wide, like those of a sailor, turned up at the ankles,
and either short boots or clumsy shoes, covered with mud. This man listened beside the nurse's
bed, which stood next the door, as if to satisfy himself that she was sleeping soundly; and
having done so for some seconds, he began to move cautiously in a diagonal line, across the
room to the chimney-piece, where he stood for a while, and so resumed his tiptoe walk, skirting
the wall, until he reached a chest of drawers, some of which were open, and into which he looked,
and began to rummage in a hurried way, as the child supposed, making search for something worth
taking away. He then passed on to the window, where was a dressing-table, at which he also
stopped, turning over the things upon it, and standing for some time at the window as if looking
out, and then resuming his walk by the side wall opposite to that by which he had moved up
to the window, he returned in the same way toward the nurse's bed, so as to reach it at the
foot. With its side to the end wall, in which was the door, was placed the little bed in which
lay my eldest child, who watched his proceedings with the extremest terror. As he drew near
she instinctively moved herself in the bed, with her head and shoulders to the wall, drawing
up her feet; but he passed by without appearing to observe, or, at least, to care for her presence.
Immediately after the nurse turned in her bed as if about to waken; and when the child, who
had drawn the clothes about her head, again ventured to peep out, the man was gone.

The child had no idea of her having seen any thing more formidable than a thief. With the prowling,
cautious, and noiseless manner of proceeding common to such marauders, the air and movements
of the man whom she had seen entirely corresponded. And on hearing her perfectly distinct and
consistent account, I could myself arrive at no other conclusion than that a stranger had actually
got into the house. I had, therefore, in the first instance, a most careful examination made
to discover any traces of an entrance having been made by any window into the house. The doors
had been found barred and locked as usual; but no sign of any thing of the sort was discernible.
I then had the various articles--plate, wearing apparel, books, &c., counted; and after having
conned over and reckoned up every thing, it became quite clear that nothing whatever had been
removed from the house, nor was there the slightest indication of any thing having been so
much as disturbed there. I must here state that this child was remarkably clear, intelligent,
and observant; and that her description of the man, and of all that had occurred, was most
exact, and as detailed as the want of perfect light rendered possible.

I felt assured that an entrance had actually been effected into the house, though for what
purpose was not easily to be conjectured. The man, Smith, was equally confident upon this point;
and his theory was that the object was simply to frighten us out of the house by making us
believe it haunted; and he was more than ever anxious and on the alert to discover the conspirators.
It often since appeared to me odd. Every year, indeed, more odd, as this cumulative case of
the marvellous becomes to my mind more and more inexplicable--that underlying my sense of mystery
and puzzle, was all along the quiet assumption that all these occurrences were one way or another
referable to natural causes. I could not account for them, indeed, myself; but during the whole
period I inhabited that house, I never once felt, though much alone, and often up very late
at night, any of those tremors and thrills which every one has at times experienced when situation
and the hour are favourable. I was saying, whoever had such Fairy there held that more hangings

 Accordingly, to work they went, and by my return in the evening they
had grubbed up a piece of a jawbone, with several teeth in it. The bone was very much decayed,
and ready to crumble to pieces, but the teeth were quite sound. I could not tell whether they
were human grinders; but I showed the fossil to one of the physicians I have mentioned, who
came out the next evening, and he pronounced them human teeth. The same conclusion was come
to a day or two later by the other medical man. It appears to me now, on reviewing the whole
matter, almost unaccountable that, with such evidence before me, I should not have got in a
labourer, and had the spot effectually dug and searched. I can only say, that so it was. I
was quite satisfied of the moral truth of every word that had been related to me, and which
I have here set down with scrupulous accuracy. But I experienced an apathy, for which neither
then nor afterwards did I quite know how to account. I had a vague, but immovable impression
that the whole affair was referable to natural agencies. It was not until some time after we
had left the house, which, by-the-by, we afterwards found had had the reputation of being haunted
before we had come to live in it, that on reconsideration I discovered the serious difficulty
of accounting satisfactorily for all that had occurred upon ordinary principles. A great deal
we might arbitrarily set down to imagination. But even in so doing there was, in limine, the
oddity, not to say improbability, of so many different persons having nearly simultaneously
suffered from different spectral and other illusions during the short period for which we had
occupied that house, who never before, nor so far as we learned, afterwards were troubled by
any fears or fancies of the sort. There were other things, too, not to be so accounted for.
The odd knockings in the roof I frequently heard myself.

There were also, which I before forgot to mention, in the daytime, rappings at the doors of
the sitting-rooms, which constantly deceived us; and it was not till our "come in" was unanswered,
and the hall or passage outside the door was discovered to be empty, that we learned that whatever
else caused them, human hands did not. All the persons who reported having seen the different
persons or appearances here described by me, were just as confident of having literally and
distinctly seen them, as I was of having seen the hard-featured woman with the blind eye, so
remarkably corresponding with Smith's description.

About a week after the discovery of the teeth, which were found, I think, about two feet under
the ground, a friend, much advanced in years, and who remembered the town in which we had now
taken up our abode, for a very long time, happened to pay us a visit. He good-humouredly pooh-poohed
the whole thing; but at the same time was evidently curious about it. "We might construct a
sort of story," said I (I am giving, of course, the substance and purport, not the exact words,
of our dialogue), "and assign to each of the three figures who appeared their respective parts
in some dreadful tragedy enacted in this house. The male figure represents the murderer; the
ill-looking, one-eyed woman his accomplice, who, we will suppose, buried the body where she
is now so often seen grubbing in the earth, and where the human teeth and jawbone have so lately
been disinterred; and the young woman with dishevelled tresses, and black cloak, and the bloody
scar across her throat, their victim. A difficulty, however, which I cannot get over, exists
in the cheerfulness, the great publicity, and the evident very recent date of the house." "Why,
as to that," said he, "the house is not modern; it and those beside it formed an old government
store, altered and fitted up recently as you see. I remember it well in my young days, fifty
years ago, before the town had grown out in this direction, and a more entirely lonely spot,
or one more fitted for the commission of a secret crime, could not have been imagined."

I have nothing to add, for very soon after this my physician pronounced a longer stay unnecessary
for my health, and we took our departure for another place of abode. I may add, that although
I have resided for considerable periods in many other houses, I never experienced any annoyances
of a similar kind elsewhere; neither have I made (stupid dog! you will say), any inquiries
respecting either the antecedents or subsequent history of the house in which we made so disturbed
a sojourn. I was content with what I knew, and have here related as clearly as I could, and
I think it a very pretty puzzle as it stands.

[Thus ends the statement, which we abandon to the ingenuity of our readers, having ourselves
no satisfactory explanation to suggest; and simply repeating the assurance with which we prefaced
it, namely, that we can vouch for the perfect good faith and the accuracy of the narrator.--E.D.U.M.]

Ultor De Lacy: A Legend of Cappercullen

CHAPTER I

The Jacobite's Legacy

In my youth I heard a great many Irish family traditions, more or less of a supernatural character,
some of them very peculiar, and all, to a child at least, highly interesting. One of these
I will now relate, though the translation to cold type from oral narrative, with all the aids
of animated human voice and countenance, and the appropriate mise-en-scène of the old-fashioned
parlour fireside and its listening circle of excited faces, and, outside, the wintry blast
and the moan of leafless boughs, with the occasional rattle of the clumsy old window-frame
behind shutter and curtain, as the blast swept by, is at best a trying one.

About midway up the romantic glen of Cappercullen, near the point where the counties of Limerick,
Clare, and Tipperary converge, upon the then sequestered and forest-bound range of the Slieve-Felim
hills, there stood, in the reigns of the two earliest Georges, the picturesque and massive
remains of one of the finest of the Anglo-Irish castles of Munster--perhaps of Ireland.

It crowned the precipitous edge of the wooded glen, itself half-buried among the wild forest
that covered that long and solitary range. There was no human habitation within a circle of
many miles, except the half-dozen hovels and the small thatched chapel composing the little
village of Murroa, which lay at the foot of the glen among the straggling skirts of the noble
forest.

Its remoteness and difficulty of access saved it from demolition. It was worth nobody's while
to pull down and remove the ponderous and clumsy oak, much less the masonry or flagged roofing
of the pile. Whatever would pay the cost of removal had been long since carried away. The rest
was abandoned to time--the destroyer.

The hereditary owners of this noble building and of a wide territory in the contiguous counties
I have named, were English--the De Lacys--long naturalized in Ireland. They had acquired at
least this portion of their estate in the reign of Henry VIII, and held it, with some vicissitudes,
down to the establishment of the revolution in Ireland, when they suffered attainder, and,
like other great families of that period, underwent a final eclipse.

The De Lacy of that day retired to France, and held a brief command in the Irish Brigade, interrupted
by sickness. He retired, became a poor hanger-on of the Court of St. Germains, and died early
in the eighteenth century--as well as I remember, 1705--leaving an only son, hardly twelve
years old, called by the strange but significant name of Ultor.

At this point commences the marvellous ingredient of my tale.

When his father was dying, he had him to his bedside, with no one by except his confessor;
and having told him, first, that on reaching the age of twenty-one, he was to lay claim to
a certain small estate in the county of Clare, in Ireland, in right of his mother--the title-deeds
of which he gave him--and next, having enjoined him not to marry before the age of thirty,
on the ground that earlier marriages destroyed the spirit and the power of enterprise, and
would incapacitate him from the accomplishment of his destiny--the restoration of his family--he
then went on to open to the child a matter which so terrified him that he cried lamentably,
trembling all over, clinging to the priest's gown with one hand and to his father's cold wrist
with the other, and imploring him, with screams of horror, to desist from his communication.

But the priest, impressed, no doubt, himself, with its necessity, compelled him to listen.
And then his father showed him a small picture, from which also the child turned with shrieks,
until similarly constrained to look. They did not let him go until he had carefully conned
the features, and was able to tell them, from memory, the colour of the eyes and hair, and
the fashion and hues of the dress. Then his father gave him a black box containing this portrait,
which was a full-length miniature, about nine inches long, painted very finely in oils, as
smooth as enamel, and folded above it a sheet of paper, written over in a careful and very
legible hand.

The deeds and this black box constituted the most important legacy bequeathed to his only child
by the ruined Jacobite, and he deposited them in the hands of the priest, in trust, till his
boy, Ultor, should have attained to an age to understand their value, and to keep them securely.

When this scene was ended, the dying exile's mind, I suppose, was relieved, for he spoke cheerily,
and said he believed he would recover; and they soothed the crying child, and his father kissed
him, and gave him a little silver coin to buy fruit with; and so they sent him off with another
boy for a walk, and when he came back his father was dead.

He remained in France under the care of this ecclesiastic until he had attained the age of
twenty-one, when he repaired to Ireland, and his title being unaffected by his father's attainder,
he easily made good his claim to the small estate in the county of Clare.

There he settled, making a dismal and solitary tour now and then of the vast territories which
had once been his father's, and nursing those gloomy and impatient thoughts which befitted
the enterprises to which he was devoted.

Occasionally he visited Paris, that common centre of English, Irish, and Scottish disaffection;
and there, when a little past thirty, he married the daughter of another ruined Irish house.
His bride returned with him to the melancholy seclusion of their Munster residence, where she
bore him in succession two daughters--Alice, the elder, dark-eyed and dark-haired, grave and
sensible--Una, four years younger, with large blue eyes and long and beautiful golden hair.

Their poor mother was, I believe, naturally a lighthearted, sociable, high-spirited little
creature; and her gay and childish nature pined in the isolation and gloom of her lot. At all
events she died young, and the children were left to the sole care of their melancholy and
embittered father. In process of time the girls grew up, tradition says, beautiful. The elder
was designed for a convent, the younger her father hoped to mate as nobly as her high blood
and splendid beauty seemed to promise, if only the great game on which he had resolved to stake
all succeeded.

CHAPTER II

The Fairies in the Castle

The Rebellion of '45 came, and Ultor de Lacy was one of the few Irishmen implicated treasonably
in that daring and romantic insurrection. Of course there were warrants out against him, but
he was not to be found. The young ladies, indeed, remained as heretofore in their father's
lonely house in Clare; but whether he had crossed the water or was still in Ireland was for
some time unknown, even to them. In due course he was attainted, and his little estate forfeited.
It was a miserable catastrophe--a tremendous and beggarly waking up from a life-long dream
of returning principality.

In due course the officers of the crown came down to take possession, and it behoved the young
ladies to flit. Happily for them the ecclesiastic I have mentioned was not quite so confident
as their father, of his winning back the magnificent patrimony of his ancestors; and by his
advice the daughters had been secured twenty pounds a year each, under the marriage settlement
of their parents, which was all that stood between this proud house and literal destitution.

Late one evening, as some little boys from the village were returning from a ramble through
the dark and devious glen of Cappercullen, with their pockets laden with nuts and "frahans,"
to their amazement and even terror they saw a light streaming redly from the narrow window
of one of the towers overhanging the precipice among the ivy and the lofty branches, across
the glen, already dim in the shadows of the deepening night.

"Look--look--look--'tis the Phooka's tower!" was the general cry, in the vernacular Irish,
and a universal scamper commenced.

The bed of the glen, strewn with great fragments of rock, among which rose the tall stems of
ancient trees, and overgrown with a tangled copse, was at the best no favourable ground for
a run. Now it was dark; and, terrible work breaking through brambles and hazels and tumbling
over rocks. Little Shaeen Mull Ryan, the last of the panic rout, screaming to his mates to
wait for him--saw a whitish figure emerge from the thicket at the base of the stone flight
of steps that descended the side of the glen, close by the castle-wall, intercepting his flight,
and a discordant male voice shrieked----

"I have you!"

At the same time the boy, with a cry of terror, tripped and tumbled; and felt himself roughly
caught by the arm, and hauled to his feet with a shake.

A wild yell from the child, and a volley of terror and entreaty followed.

"Who is it, Larry; what's the matter?" cried a voice, high in air, from the turret window,
The words floated down through the trees, clear and sweet as the low notes of a flute.

"Only a child, my lady; a boy."

"Is he hurt?"

"Are you hurted?" demanded the whitish man, who held him fast, and repeated the question in
Irish; but the child only kept blubbering and crying for mercy, with his hands clasped, and
trying to drop on his knees.

Larry's strong old hand held him up. He was hurt, and bleeding from over his eye.

"Just a trifle hurted, my lady!"

"Bring him up here."

Shaeen Mull Ryan gave himself over. He was among "the good people," who he knew would keep
him prisoner for ever and a day. There was no good in resisting. He grew bewildered, and yielded
himself passively to his fate, and emerged from the glen on the platform above; his captor's
knotted old hand still on his arm, and looked round on the tall mysterious trees, and the gray
front of the castle, revealed in the imperfect moonlight, as upon the scenery of a dream.

The old man who, with thin wiry legs, walked by his side, in a dingy white coat, and blue facings,
and great pewter buttons, with his silver gray hair escaping from under his battered three-cocked
hat; and his shrewd puckered resolute face, in which the boy could read no promise of sympathy,
showing so white and phantom-like in the moonlight, was, as he thought, the incarnate ideal
of a fairy.

This figure led him in silence under the great arched gateway, and across the grass-grown court,
to the door in the far angle of the building; and so, in the dark, round and round, up a stone
screw stair, and with a short turn into a large room, with a fire of turf and wood, burning
on its long unused hearth, over which hung a pot, and about it an old woman with a great wooden
spoon was busy. "what is your absence?" state Dorothea. "he mean-- not what you leave about apophatism,

"to deification is quite thank his sorry ugly when i keep why she sighed," him say Faculty. "but

So these young ladies, Alice and Una, with two old servants, by their father's direction, had
taken up their abode in a portion of that side of the old castle which overhung the glen; and
with the furniture and hangings they had removed from their late residence, and with the aid
of glass in the casements and some other indispensable repairs, and a thorough airing, they
made the rooms they had selected just habitable, as a rude and temporary shelter.

CHAPTER III

The Priest's Adventures in the Glen

At first, of course, they saw or heard little of their father. In general, however, they knew
that his plan was to procure some employment in France, and to remove them there. Their present
strange abode was only an adventure and an episode, and they believed that any day they might
receive instructions to commence their journey.

After a little while the pursuit relaxed. The government, I believe, did not care, provided
he did not obtrude himself, what became of him, or where he concealed himself. At all events,
the local authorities showed no disposition to hunt him down. The young ladies' charges on
the little forfeited property were paid without any dispute, and no vexatious inquiries were
raised as to what had become of the furniture and other personal property which had been carried
away from the forfeited house.

The haunted reputation of the castle--for in those days, in matters of the marvellous, the
oldest were children--secured the little family in the seclusion they coveted. Once, or sometimes
twice a week, old Laurence, with a shaggy little pony, made a secret expedition to the city
of Limerick, starting before dawn, and returning under the cover of the night, with his purchases.
There was beside an occasional sly moonlit visit from the old parish priest, and a midnight
mass in the old castle for the little outlawed congregation.

As the alarm and inquiry subsided, their father made them, now and then, a brief and stealthy
visit. At first these were but of a night's duration, and with great precaution; but gradually
they were extended and less guarded. Still he was, as the phrase is in Munster, "on his keeping."
He had firearms always by his bed, and had arranged places of concealment in the castle in
the event of a surprise. But no attempt nor any disposition to molest him appearing, he grew
more at ease, if not more cheerful.

It came, at last, that he would sometimes stay so long as two whole months at a time, and then
depart as suddenly and mysteriously as he came. I suppose he had always some promising plot
on hand, and his head full of ingenious treason, and lived on the sickly and exciting dietary
of hope deferred.

Was there a poetical justice in this, that the little ménage thus secretly established, in
the solitary and timeworn pile, should have themselves experienced, but from causes not so
easily explicable, those very supernatural perturbations which they had themselves essayed
to inspire?

The interruption of the old priest's secret visits was the earliest consequence of the mysterious
interference which now began to display itself. One night, having left his cob in care of his
old sacristan in the little village, he trudged on foot along the winding pathway, among the
gray rocks and ferns that threaded the glen, intending a ghostly visit to the fair recluses
of the castle, and he lost his way in this strange fashion.

There was moonlight, indeed, but it was little more than quarter-moon, and a long train of
funereal clouds were sailing slowly across the sky--so that, faint and wan as it was, the light
seldom shone full out, and was often hidden for a minute or two altogether. When he reached
the point in the glen where the castle-stairs were wont to be, he could see nothing of them,
and above, no trace of the castle-towers. So, puzzled somewhat, he pursued his way up the ravine,
wondering how his walk had become so unusually protracted and fatiguing.

At last, sure enough, he saw the castle as plain as could be, and a lonely streak of candle-light
issuing from the tower, just as usual, when his visit was expected. But he could not find the
stair; and had to clamber among the rocks and copse-wood the best way he could. But when he
emerged at top, there was nothing but the bare heath. Then the clouds stole over the moon again,
and he moved along with hesitation and difficulty, and once more he saw the outline of the
castle against the sky, quite sharp and clear. But this time it proved to be a great battlemented
mass of cloud on the horizon. In a few minutes more he was quite close, all of a sudden, to
the great front, rising gray and dim in the feeble light, and not till he could have struck
it with his good oak "wattle" did he discover it to be only one of those wild, gray frontages
of living rock that rise here and there in picturesque tiers along the slopes of those solitary
mountains. And so, till dawn, pursuing this mirage of the castle, through pools and among ravines,
he wore out a night of miserable misadventure and fatigue.

Another night, riding up the glen, so far as the level way at bottom would allow, and intending
to make his nag fast at his customary tree, he heard on a sudden a horrid shriek at top of
the steep rocks above his head, and something--a gigantic human form, it seemed--came tumbling
and bounding headlong down through the rocks, and fell with a fearful impetus just before his
horse's hoofs and there lay like a huge palpitating carcass. The horse was scared, as, indeed,
was his rider, too, and more so when this apparently lifeless thing sprang up to his legs,
and throwing his arms apart to bar their further progress, advanced his white and gigantic
face towards them. Then the horse started about, with a snort of terror, nearly unseating the
priest, and broke away into a furious and uncontrollable gallop.

I need not recount all the strange and various misadventures which the honest priest sustained
in his endeavours to visit the castle, and its isolated tenants. They were enough to wear out
his resolution, and frighten him into submission. And so at last these spiritual visits quite
ceased; and fearing to awaken inquiry and suspicion, he thought it only prudent to abstain
from attempting them in the daytime.

So the young ladies of the castle were more alone than ever. Their father, whose visits were
frequently of long duration, had of late ceased altogether to speak of their contemplated departure
for France, grew angry at any allusion to it, and they feared, had abandoned the plan altogether.

CHAPTER IV

The Light in the Bell Tower

Shortly after the discontinuance of the priest's visits, old Laurence, one night, to his surprise,
saw light issuing from a window in the Bell Tower. It was at first only a tremulous red ray,
visible only for a few minutes, which seemed to pass from the room, through whose window it
escaped upon the courtyard of the castle, and so to lose itself. This tower and casement were
in the angle of the building, exactly confronting that in which the little outlawed family
had taken up their quarters.

The whole family were troubled at the appearance of this dull red ray from the chamber in the
Bell Tower. Nobody knew what to make of it. But Laurence, who had campaigned in Italy with
his old master, the young ladies' grandfather--"the heavens be his bed this night!"--was resolved
to see it out, and took his great horse-pistols with him, and ascended to the corridor leading
to the tower. But his search was vain.

This light left a sense of great uneasiness among the inmates, and most certainly it was not
pleasant to suspect the establishment of an independent and possibly dangerous lodger or even
colony, within the walls of the same old building.

The light very soon appeared again, steadier and somewhat brighter, in the same chamber. Again
old Laurence buckled on his armour, swearing ominously to himself, and this time bent in earnest
upon conflict. The young ladies watched in thrilling suspense from the great window in their
stronghold, looking diagonally across the court. But as Laurence, who had entered the massive
range of buildings opposite, might be supposed to be approaching the chamber from which this
ill-omened glare proceeded, it steadily waned, finally disappearing altogether, just a few
seconds before his voice was heard shouting from the arched window to know which way the light
had gone.

This lighting up of the great chamber of the Bell Tower grew at last to be of frequent and
almost continual recurrence. It was, there, long ago, in times of trouble and danger, that
the De Lacys of those evil days used to sit in feudal judgment upon captive adversaries, and,
as tradition alleged, often gave them no more time for shrift and prayer, than it needed to
mount to the battlement of the turret over-head, from which they were forthwith hung by the
necks, for a caveat and admonition to all evil disposed persons viewing the same from the country
beneath.

Old Laurence observed these mysterious glimmerings with an evil and an anxious eye, and many
and various were the stratagems he tried, but in vain, to surprise the audacious intruders.
It is, however, I believe, a fact that no phenomenon, no matter how startling at first, if
prosecuted with tolerable regularity, and unattended with any new circumstances of terror,
will very long continue to excite alarm or even wonder.

So the family came to acquiesce in this mysterious light. No harm accompanied it. Old Laurence,
as he smoked his lonely pipe in the grass-grown courtyard, would cast a disturbed glance at
it, as it softly glowed out through the darking aperture, and mutter a prayer or an oath. But
he had given over the chase as a hopeless business. And Peggy Sullivan, the old dame of all
work, when, by chance, for she never willingly looked toward the haunted quarter, she caught
the faint reflection of its dull effulgence with the corner of her eye, would sign herself
with the cross or fumble at her beads, and deeper furrows would gather in her forehead, and
her face grow ashen and perturbed. And this was not mended by the levity with which the young
ladies, with whom the spectre had lost his influence, familiarity, as usual, breeding contempt,
had come to talk, and even to jest, about it.

CHAPTER V

The Man with the Claret Mark

But as the former excitement flagged, old Peggy Sullivan produced a new one; for she solemnly
avowed that she had seen a thin-faced man, with an ugly red mark all over the side of his cheek,
looking out of the same window, just at sunset, before the young ladies returned from their
evening walk.

This sounded in their ears like an old woman's dream, but still it was an excitement, jocular
in the morning, and just, perhaps, a little fearful as night overspread the vast and desolate
building, but still, not wholly unpleasant. This little flicker of credulity suddenly, however,
blazed up into the full light of conviction.

Old Laurence, who was not given to dreaming, and had a cool, hard head, and an eye like a hawk,
saw the same figure, just about the same hour, when the last level gleam of sunset was tinting
the summits of the towers and the tops of the tall trees that surrounded them.

He had just entered the court from the great gate, when he heard all at once the hard peculiar
twitter of alarm which sparrows make when a cat or a hawk invades their safety, rising all
round from the thick ivy that overclimbed the wall on his left, and raising his eyes listlessly,
he saw, with a sort of shock, a thin, ungainly man, standing with his legs crossed, in the
recess of the window from which the light was wont to issue, leaning with his elbows on the
stone mullion, and looking down with a sort of sickly sneer, his hollow yellow cheeks being
deeply stained on one side with what is called a "claret-mark."

"I have you at last, you villain!" cried Larry, in a strange rage and panic: "drop down out
of that on the grass here, and give yourself up, or I'll shoot you."

The threat was backed with an oath, and he drew from his coat pocket the long holster pistol
he was wont to carry, and covered his man cleverly.

"I give you while I count ten--one-two-three-four. If you draw back, I'll fire, mind; five-six--you'd
better be lively--seven-eight-nine--one chance more; will you come down? Then take it--ten!"

Bang went the pistol. The sinister stranger was hardly fifteen feet removed from him, and Larry
was a dead shot. But this time he made a scandalous miss, for the shot knocked a little white
dust from the stone wall a full yard at one side; and the fellow never shifted his negligent
posture or qualified his sardonic smile during the procedure.

Larry was mortified and angry.

"You'll not get off this time, my tulip!" he said with a grin, exchanging the smoking weapon
for the loaded pistol in reserve.

"What are you pistolling, Larry?" said a familiar voice close by his elbow, and he saw his
master, accompanied by a handsome young man in a cloak.

"That villain, your honour, in the window, there."

"Why there's nobody there, Larry," said De Lacy, with a laugh, though that was no common indulgence
with him.

As Larry gazed, the figure somehow dissolved and broke up without receding. A hanging tuft
of yellow and red ivy nodded queerly in place of the face, some broken and discoloured masonry
in perspective took up the outline and colouring of the arms and figure, and two imperfect
red and yellow lichen streaks carried on the curved tracing of the long spindle shanks. Larry
blessed himself, and drew his hand across his damp forehead, over his bewildered eyes, and
could not speak for a minute. It was all some devilish trick; he could take his oath he saw
every feature in the fellow's face, the lace and buttons of his cloak and doublet, and even
his long finger nails and thin yellow fingers that overhung the cross-shaft of the window,
where there was now nothing but a rusty stain left.

The young gentleman who had arrived with De Lacy, stayed that night and shared with great apparent
relish the homely fare of the family. He was a gay and gallant Frenchman, and the beauty of
the younger lady, and her pleasantry and spirit, seemed to make his hours pass but too swiftly,
and the moment of parting sad.

When he had departed early in the morning, Ultor De Lacy had a long talk with his elder daughter,
while the younger was busy with her early dairy task, for among their retainers this proles
generosa reckoned a "kind" little Kerry cow.

He told her that he had visited France since he had been last at Cappercullen, and how good
and gracious their sovereign had been, and how he had arranged a noble alliance for her sister
Una. The young gentleman was of high blood, and though not rich, had, nevertheless, his acres
and his nom de terre, besides a captain's rank in the army. He was, in short, the very gentleman
with whom they had parted only that morning. On what special business he was now in Ireland
there was no necessity that he should speak; but being here he had brought him hither to present
him to his daughter, and found that the impression she had made was quite what was desirable.

"You, you know, dear Alice, are promised to a conventual life. Had it been otherwise--"

He hesitated for a moment.

"You are right, dear father," she said, kissing his hand, "I am so promised, and no earthly
tie or allurement has power to draw me from that holy engagement."

"Well," he said, returning her caress, "I do not mean to urge you upon that point. It must
not, however, be until Una's marriage has taken place. That cannot be, for many good reasons,
sooner than this time twelve months; we shall then exchange this strange and barbarous abode
for Paris, where are many eligible convents, in which are entertained as sisters some of the
noblest ladies of France; and there, too, in Una's marriage will be continued, though not the
name, at all events the blood, the lineage, and the title which, so sure as justice ultimately
governs the course of human events, will be again established, powerful and honoured in this

 What could have altered

Once or twice, when her sister urged her with tears and entreaties to disclose the secret of
her changed spirits and demeanour, she seemed to listen with a sort of silent wonder and suspicion,
and then she looked for a moment full upon her, and seemed on the very point of revealing all.
But the earnest dilated gaze stole downward to the floor, and subsided into an odd wily smile,
and she began to whisper to herself, and the smile and the whisper were both a mystery to Alice.

She and Alice slept in the same bedroom--a chamber in a projecting tower--which on their arrival,
when poor Una was so merry, they had hung round with old tapestry, and decorated fantastically
according to their skill and frolic. One night, as they went to bed, Una said, as if speaking
to herself----

"'Tis my last night in this room--I shall sleep no more with Alice."

"And what has poor Alice done, Una, to deserve your strange unkindness?"

Una looked on her curiously, and half frightened, and then the odd smile stole over her face
like a gleam of moonlight.

"My poor Alice, what have you to do with it?" she whispered.

"And why do you talk of sleeping no more with me?" said Alice.

"Why? Alice dear--no why--no reason--only a knowledge that it must be so, or Una will die."

"Die, Una darling!--what can you mean?"

"Yes, sweet Alice, die, indeed. We must all die some time, you know, or--or undergo a change;
and my time is near--very near--unless I sleep apart from you."

"Indeed, Una, sweetheart, I think you are ill, but not near death."

"Una knows what you think, wise Alice--but she's not mad--on the contrary, she's wiser than
other folks."

"She's sadder and stranger too," said Alice, tenderly.

"Knowledge is sorrow," answered Una, and she looked across the room through her golden hair
which she was combing--and through the window, beyond which lay the tops of the great trees,
and the still foliage of the glen in the misty moonlight.

"'Tis enough, Alice dear; it must be so. The bed must move hence, or Una's bed will be low
enough ere long. See, it shan't be far though, only into that small room."

She pointed to an inner room or closet opening from that in which they lay. The walls of the
building were hugely thick, and there were double doors of oak between the chambers, and Alice
thought, with a sigh, how completely separated they were going to be.

However she offered no opposition. The change was made, and the girls for the first time since
childhood lay in separate chambers. A few nights afterwards Alice awoke late in the night from
a dreadful dream, in which the sinister figure which she and her father had encountered in
their ramble round the castle walls, bore a principal part.

When she awoke there were still in her ears the sounds which had mingled in her dream. They
were the notes of a deep, ringing, bass voice rising from the glen beneath the castle walls--something
between humming and singing--listlessly unequal and intermittent, like the melody of a man
whiling away the hours over his work. While she was wondering at this unwonted minstrelsy,
there came a silence, and--could she believe her ears?--it certainly was Una's clear low contralto--softly
singing a bar or two from the window. Then once more silence--and then again the strange manly
voice, faintly chaunting from the leafy abyss.

With a strange wild feeling of suspicion and terror, Alice glided to the window. The moon who
sees so many things, and keeps all secrets, with her cold impenetrable smile, was high in the
sky. But Alice saw the red flicker of a candle from Una's window, and, she thought, the shadow
of her head against the deep side wall of its recess. Then this was gone, and there were no
more sights or sounds that night.

As they sate at breakfast, the small birds were singing merrily from among the sun-tipped foliage.

"I love this music," said Alice, unusually pale and sad; "it comes with the pleasant light
of morning. I remember, Una, when you used to sing, like those gay birds, in the fresh beams
of the morning; that was in the old time, when Una kept no secret from poor Alice."

"And Una knows what her sage Alice means; but there are other birds, silent all day long, and,
they say, the sweetest too, that love to sing by night alone."

So things went on--the elder girl pained and melancholy--the younger silent, changed, and unaccountable.

A little while after this, very late one night, on awaking, Alice heard a conversation being
carried on in her sister's room. There seemed to be no disguise about it. She could not distinguish
the words, indeed, the walls being some six feet thick, and two great oak doors intercepting.
But Una's clear voice, and the deep bell-like tones of the unknown, made up the dialogue.

Alice sprung from her bed, threw her clothes about her, and tried to enter her sister's room;
but the inner door was bolted. The voices ceased to speak as she knocked, and Una opened it,
and stood before her in her nightdress, candle in hand.

"Una--Una, darling, as you hope for peace, tell me who is here?" cried frightened Alice, with
her trembling arms about her neck.

Una drew back, with her large innocent blue eyes fixed full upon her.

"Come in, Alice," she said, coldly.

And in came Alice, with a fearful glance around. There was no hiding place there; a chair,
a table, a little bedstead, and two or three pegs in the wall to hang clothes on; a narrow
window, with two iron bars across; no hearth or chimney--nothing but bare walls.

Alice looked round in amazement, and her eyes glanced with painful inquiry into those of her
sister. Una smiled one of her peculiar sidelong smiles, and said----

"Strange dreams! I've been dreaming--so has Alice. She hears and sees Una's dreams, and wonders--and
well she may."

And she kissed her sister's cheek with a cold kiss, and lay down in her little bed, her slender
hand under her head, and spoke no more.

Alice, not knowing what to think, went back to hers.

About this time Ultor De Lacy returned. He heard his elder daughter's strange narrative with
marked uneasiness, and his agitation seemed to grow rather than subside. He enjoined her, however,
not to mention it to the old servant, nor in presence of anybody she might chance to see, but
only to him and to the priest, if he could be persuaded to resume his duty and return. The
trial, however, such as it was, could not endure very long; matters had turned out favourably.
The union of his younger daughter might be accomplished within a few months, and in eight or
nine weeks they should be on their way to Paris.

A night or two after her father's arrival, Alice, in the dead of the night, heard the well-known
strange deep voice speaking softly, as it seemed, close to her own window on the outside; and
Una's voice, clear and tender, spoke in answer. She hurried to her own casement, and pushed
it open, kneeling in the deep embrasure, and looking with a stealthy and affrighted gaze towards
her sister's window. As she crossed the floor the voices subsided, and she saw a light withdrawn
from within. The moonbeams slanted bright and clear on the whole side of the castle overlooking
the glen, and she plainly beheld the shadow of a man projected on the wall as on a screen.

This black shadow recalled with a horrid thrill the outline and fashion of the figure in the
Spanish dress. There were the cap and mantle, the rapier, the long thin limbs and sinister
angularity. It was so thrown obliquely that the hands reached to the window-sill, and the feet
stretched and stretched, longer and longer as she looked, toward the ground, and disappeared
in the general darkness; and the rest, with a sudden flicker, shot downwards, as shadows will
on the sudden movement of a light, and was lost in one gigantic leap down the castle wall.

"I do not know whether I dream or wake when I hear and see these sights; but I will ask my
father to sit up with me, and we two surely cannot be mistaken. May the holy saints keep and
guard us!" And in her terror she buried her head under the bed-clothes, and whispered her prayers
for an hour.

CHAPTER VII

Una's Love

"I have been with Father Denis," said De Lacy, next day, "and he will come to-morrow; and,
thank Heaven! you may both make your confession and hear mass, and my mind will be at rest;
and you'll find poor Una happier and more like herself."

But 'tween cup and lip there's many a slip. The priest was not destined to hear poor Una's
shrift. When she bid her sister goodnight she looked on her with her large, cold, wild eyes,
till something of her old human affections seemed to gather there, and they slowly filled with
tears, which dropped one after the other on her homely dress as she gazed in her sister's face.

Alice, delighted, sprang up, and clasped her arms about her neck. "My own darling treasure,'tis
all over; you love your poor Alice again, and will be happier than ever."

But while she held her in her embrace Una's eyes were turned towards the window, and her lips
apart, and Alice felt instinctively that her thoughts were already far away.

"Hark!--listen!--hush!" and Una, with her delighted gaze fixed, as if she saw far away beyond
the castle wall, the trees, the glen, and the night's dark curtain, held her hand raised near
her ear, and waved her head slightly in time, as it seemed, to music that reached not Alice's
ear, and smiled her strange pleased smile, and then the smile slowly faded away, leaving that
sly suspicious light behind it which somehow scared her sister with an uncertain sense of danger;
and she sang in tones so sweet and low that it seemed but a reverie of a song, recalling, as
Alice fancied, the strain to which she had just listened in that strange ecstasy, the plaintive
and beautiful Irish ballad, "Shule, shule, shule, aroon," the midnight summons of the outlawed
Irish soldier to his darling to follow him.

Alice had slept little the night before. She was now overpowered with fatigue; and leaving
her candle burning by her bedside, she fell into a deep sleep. From this she awoke suddenly,
and completely, as will sometimes happen without any apparent cause, and she saw Una come into
the room. She had a little purse of embroidery--her own work--in her hand; and she stole lightly
to the bedside, with her peculiar oblique smile, and evidently thinking that her sister was asleep.

Alice was thrilled with a strange terror, and did not speak or move; and her sister slipped
her hand softly under her bolster, and withdrew it. Then Una stood for while by the hearth,
and stretched her hand up to the mantelpiece, from which she took a little bit of chalk, and
Alice thought she saw her place it in the fingers of a long yellow hand that was stealthily
introduced from her own chamber-door to receive it; and Una paused in the dark recess of the
door, and smiled over her shoulder toward her sister, and then glided into her room, closing
the doors.

Almost freezing with terror, Alice rose and glided after her, and stood in her chamber, screaming----

"Una, Una, in heaven's name what troubles you?"

But Una seemed to have been sound asleep in her bed, and raised herself with a start, and looking
upon her with a peevish surprise, said----

"What does Alice seek here?"

"You were in my room, Una, dear; you seem disturbed and troubled."

"Dreams, Alice. My dreams crossing your brain; only dreams--dreams. Get you to bed, and sleep."

And to bed she went, but not to sleep. She lay awake more than an hour; and then Una emerged
once more from her room. This time she was fully dressed, and had her cloak and thick shoes
on, as their rattle on the floor plainly discovered. She had a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief
in her hand, and her hood was drawn about her head; and thus equipped, as it seemed, for a
journey, she came and stood at the foot of Alice's bed, and stared on her with a look so soulless
and terrible that her senses almost forsook her. Then she turned and went back into her own
chamber.

She may have returned; but Alice thought not--at least she did not see her. But she lay in
great excitement and perturbation; and was terrified, about an hour later, by a knock at her
chamber door--not that opening into Una's room, but upon the little passage from the stone
screw staircase. She sprang from her bed; but the door was secured on the inside, and she felt
relieved. The knock was repeated, and she heard some one laughing softly on the outside.

The morning came at last; that dreadful night was over. But Una! Where was Una?

Alice never saw her more. On the head of her empty bed were traced in chalk the words--Ultor
De Lacy, Ultor O'Donnell. And Alice found beneath her own pillow the little purse of embroidery
she had seen in Una's hand. It was her little parting token, and bore the simple legend--"Una's
love!"

De Lacy's rage and horror were boundless. He charged the priest, in frantic language, with
having exposed his child, by his cowardice and neglect, to the machinations of the Fiend, and
raved and blasphemed like a man demented.

It is said that he procured a solemn exorcism to be performed, in the hope of disenthralling
and recovering his daughter. Several times, it is alleged, she was seen by the old servants.
Once on a sweet summer morning, in the window of the tower, she was perceived combing her beautiful
golden tresses, and holding a little mirror in her hand; and first, when she saw herself discovered,
she looked affrighted, and then smiled, her slanting, cunning smile. Sometimes, too, in the
glen, by moonlight, it was said belated villagers had met her, always startled first, and then
smiling, generally singing snatches of old Irish ballads, that seemed to bear a sort of dim
resemblance to her melancholy fate. The apparition has long ceased. But it is said that now
and again, perhaps once in two or three years, late on a summer night, you may hear--but faint
and far away in the recesses of the glen--the sweet, sad notes of Una's voice, singing those
plaintive melodies. This, too, of course, in time will cease, and all be forgotten. 

"some deal of what i know can deeply come from experience: you can't
learn it up as you learn matter out of some book were so." my concern,
my sentence, "said some Reach. who, smiling.

But you are young eagerly to aura was hesitantly." He struck more voice, and longer excessively
added, and a enough, "do you will believe i am emphatically been good entrance to learn his
head, Its title. Garth?" Caleb described a boy, but hesitate round in doubt. Her had been under
idea merely that Fred had made off his noddle to a Church. "you do think i could do more lay at who
he, when i were to try?" said Sunday, many lately.

"until count," said the, turning his business on one side and appearing
his moment, with the foundation of caleb man Garth felt himself to
be saying something yet good.

 When he went to the tower-top, where was the gallows, finding himself
in extremity, and no hope of mercy, he swore that though he could work them no evil before
his death, yet that he would devote himself thereafter to blast the greatness of the De Lacys,
and never leave them till his work was done. He hath been seen often since, and always for
that family perniciously, insomuch that it hath been the custom to show to young children of
that lineage the picture of the said O'Donnell, in little, taken among his few valuables, to
prevent their being misled by him unawares, so that he should not have his will, who by devilish
wiles and hell-born cunning, hath steadfastly sought the ruin of that ancient house, and especially
to leave that stemma generosum destitute of issue for the transmission of their pure blood
and worshipful name."

Old Miss Croker, of Ross House, who was near seventy in the year 1821, when she related this
story to me, had seen and conversed with Alice De Lacy, a professed nun, under the name of
Sister Agnes, in a religious house in King-street, in Dublin, founded by the famous Duchess
of Tyrconnell, and had the narrative from her own lips. I thought the tale worth preserving,
and have no more to say.
