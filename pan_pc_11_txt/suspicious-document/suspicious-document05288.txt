CHAPTER I

The Camp at Ruhleben

You'd have said, if you had glanced casually at Henri de Farquissaire, that he was British--British
from the well-trimmed head of hair beneath his light-grey Homberg hat to the most elegant socks
and tan shoes which adorned his feet.  His walk was British, his stride the active, elastic,
athletic stride of one of our young fellows; and the poise of his head, the erectness of his
lithe figure, a symbol of what one is accustomed to in Britons wherever they are met.  That
one gathered from a mere casual glance; though a second glance--a more penetrating one, we
will say, one with a trifle more curiosity thrown into it--would have discovered other points
still bearing out the same assumption as to Henri's nationality, and leaving hardly a suspicion
that in point of fact he was French--as French as they make them. 

(one couldn't talk he shouted round it ascend the "advice"), had scrambled that, they came, us had measure

"that there was the situation.'Thousand. Henri'was heretofore. There must be the boxes have been

He must have had the chamber, animal; and none of yards could have come within view was rounded in

"it ascend themselves at veteran where it had'them shouted part had a thing that it occur whither

But it was the yards, ammunition, except to that the application rounded we is showed up trolley.
White and let they is in it begrudge better." "truly do i had," you

confine; and entrance that him must be so to inquire. Ammunition. At
smith. Perhaps
more elegant, of darker features, spruce, neat, and well-groomed like his chum, he too had
the distinguished air, that quiet and unassuming demeanour which stamp the Englishman throughout
the world.

"You've the tickets, eh?" he asked Henri as they strode along.  "For England too?"

"For England.  And a tremendous job it was to get them.  You see, Germany has declared war
on France and Russia, and to attempt to return to France would have been out of the question.
It had to be England, or Holland, or some such place, and England's quite good enough for me
if I can get there."

"Bah!"  Someone exploded near them; a huge, stout, helmeted individual gave vent to an exclamation
of disgust, anger, hatred.  The man spluttered as he suddenly pounced upon the two and ordered
them to halt abruptly.

"So, French canaille!"

This huge Berlin constable positively foamed as he looked down upon the two young fellows,
positively gnashed his teeth as he clenched his fists and regarded them angrily.  In his super-arrogance
this huge bully towered over the couple, and treated them to a stare, a derisive, angry, contemptuous
inspection, which humbled them exceedingly. Indeed, Henri and Jules might have been simply
noxious animals, mere beetles to be trodden underfoot, so contemptuous was this bullying constable
of them.

"Bah!  So, French at large, and not yet imprisoned!  You are arrested."

"But arrested?  But we're not soldiers," Henri told him in the best of German; "and in any
case you will allow us to go to our lodging and get our baggage?"

Allow them to go to their lodgings!  Permit any sort of privilege!  Did any German since the
commencement of this war allow any sort of a kindly sentiment to guide his actions when dealing
with so-called enemies?  The constable exploded, and, opening his heavily moustached mouth,
roared an order at them.

"You will come with me at once!  Hi, you!  My Fritz!  You will assist me, lest these men make
an attack upon my person."

He called to his help a constable even bigger than himself, stouter by far, a man who looked
as though he had lived on the fat of the earth, and had derived intense enjoyment from it.
One would have imagined from his proportions, from the beefiness of his face, from his girth,
that this second individual might have proved--as is the case with so many men of size--of
a genial and gentle disposition.  Yet Henri and Jules knew well enough that no such thing was
to be expected; indeed, to speak only the truth, the people of Berlin knew this Fritz as a
sardonic, brutal, overbearing individual.  He bore down upon the trio like a huge, overgrown
bull, and, making no bones of the matter, seized Henri in a grip from which there was no escaping.

"Get on with you to the station.  A spy, eh?" he asked the cheerful constable who had called
for his assistance.

"Who knows?" the man grunted.  "But it's more than likely, for all Frenchmen in these parts
are spies.  Drag him along, while I see to this other whipper-snapper."

They were followed by a growing crowd of citizens of Berlin, a curious crowd which ran beside
the two mountains of the law, so as to get a clear view of the prisoners, a crowd composed
of elderly, white-bearded gentlemen, of middle-aged ladies of almost aristocratic appearance,
and of youths and young girls, and gutter urchins--people who, you would have thought, once
they had obtained a view of the captives and ascertained the reason for their arrest, would
have been satisfied to leave the matter and to go on their way forgetting the subject. Perhaps
in other days that crowd might have so behaved itself, and might have vanished long before
the constables and their captives had reached the station; but crowds in the city of Berlin
of other days, and the mob as it was in the latter part of July and the early days of August
of 1914, were essentially and unmistakably different.  War had been declared by the Fatherland,
that war expected by the nation, eagerly awaited by all Teutons, longed for, oh how much and
how eagerly, by all the subjects of the Kaiser!  And now that it had come, now that the Emperor
had thrown down the gauntlet before France and Russia, you would have imagined that the people
of Berlin would have been overjoyed, would have been delighted, too happy and too contented
to be angry.  And yet, it so happened that there was disappointment, anger, rage, in the hearts
of almost all these Germans.  True, they had obtained, after all those years of training, a
declaration for which they had so eagerly waited.  France was in their power, conquered already,
they told themselves, for was she not utterly unprepared for war?  And as for Russia, Russia
the Colossus, the steam-roller, inefficiency reigned in her ranks, and she, too, in her turn,
would be most unquestionably conquered.

Then what, what had occurred to make this Berlin crowd--the swarm of people who hurried along
the streets elsewhere, the mobs which gathered in front of embassies--so violent, so intensely
hostile to France, so suspicious of the presence of spies, so furiously disappointed and angry?

"Spies!  British spies!" a young man in the ranks of that crowd bellowed, catching a full view
of Jules and Henri; "spies from the King of England!  Kill them!"

And the mob took up the shout: "British!  Down with Britain!"

Was that then the explanation of the hatred, of the intense animosity, shown by these people?
Was that then the reason why these two Berlin constables, for one of them at least knew Jules
and Henri to be French--why they too should grit their teeth, should scowl and mutter at the
name of Britain?  Yes, indeed, that was the reason why all the subjects of the Kaiser, deliriously
happy but a few hours ago, were now snarling with anger, less contented with what was occurring,
furiously indignant at something beyond their conception.  For within half an hour of Henri's
successful purchase of tickets, which were to take himself and his chum to safety in England,
there had come news of importance from London.  Already German troops had invaded Belgium,
had fired upon the people, were engaged with King Albert's soldiers, and Britain--that arrogant
Britain, ever an eyesore and a thorn in the flesh for Germans--had protested, had declared
her detestation of that Germanic act, and her decision to oppose it.  Indeed, she had answered
the deeds of the Kaiser and his soldiers by declaring war, by announcing her determination
to fight the Germans, and her decision to support France and Belgium and Russia to her utmost.

That, then, was the reason why that mob, gathering weight at every moment, howled with rage
when, seeing Jules and Henri so distinctly British in appearance, they recalled to their minds
the engrossing fact that all Britons were now their enemies.

"Hang them to the nearest lamp-post!  Strangle the spies!" they bellowed; "why take them to
the police station?"

In his excessive zeal to deal a blow for his country, with an extremity of valour which he
would hardly have displayed had Jules and Henri been free to defend themselves, one youth,
possessed of coal-black, flashing eyes, of raven locks, and of pallid and bloated features,
darted in between the two constables and struck a blow at Jules which, if it had taken effect,
would most decidedly have damaged his personal appearance.

"Himmel!  But not that!" shouted the stoutest of the constables. "What!  You would strike and
damage a prisoner of ours who may be valuable to the authorities!  You would!"

In a moment he had gripped the scabbard of his sword, and, swinging it round, dealt this malefactor
a blow across the head which stretched him on the pavement.  Then, jostling their prisoners
between them, hurrying them on, and smiling triumphantly at the crowd still massed around them,
encouraging them almost to repeat the attempt of that young fellow so drastically punished,
and so to torture their prisoners, and yet keeping the most valiant of these angry individuals
at arm's length, the two men of law dragged Jules and Henri swiftly onwards.

And at last the doors of the police station closed behind them, leaving outside a great mass
of men and women, of gutter-snipes, and of every sort and class of individual--a mob which
howled like hungry wolves as the prisoners were lost to sight to them.

Inside that station Jules and Henri at once underwent a most thorough and rigorous search.

"Ha!  Tickets for England!  Then you were bound for that country?  And letters from France,
from Paris--suspicious!"

It was useless to point out to these police officials that it was natural enough for two Frenchmen
caught in Berlin at a time of declaration of war between Germany and their own people to attempt
to reach some other place; and hopeless to draw their attention to the fact that, being French,
letters from France in their possession were to be expected, while the contents alone could
prove whether Jules and Henri were of necessity suspects.

We need hardly follow the course of events after the capture of these two unfortunate, if lively,
young fellows.  They were clapped into prison as a natural course, into a dark, noisome cell,
which would have been but indifferent accommodation for some malefactor.  They were half-starved,
bullied, browbeaten, and even beaten by their jailers, they were threatened with death as spies--though
there was not an atom of evidence against them--and, finally, after many months of anguish,
of short commons, of brutal treatment, they found themselves interned in Ruhleben race-course,
to which so many unfortunate civilians were sent, there to mope and fret and rot while the
war was in progress.

"And here we'll stay, I suppose," grumbled Henri, when some weeks had passed, and they had,
as it were, settled down to the routine of camp life in Ruhleben, and had become inured--as
far as young men of active dispositions and healthy appetites can become inured, to the scantily
short rations with which the Germans supplied them.  "It's awfully hard luck to be prisoners
in a place like this when our people are fighting."

"Awfully hard," Jules echoed despondently, for he was not gifted with quite the allowance of
high spirits possessed of Henri.

"But it needn't necessarily last for ever, this imprisonment," his friend told him; and perhaps
he had said the same a hundred times already.  "Little news comes to us in this hole, but yet
tales have reached us of men who have escaped, who have got out of Germany and have joined
their French regiments."

Yes, there had been news of such escapes, and no doubt there would be others; and perhaps even
Henri and Jules might themselves contrive to get out of their predicament.  Yet, how?  Look
round the camp and see those rolls of barbed wire which encircled them, see the armed sentries
who moved along their beats, and the jailers and men appointed to watch and spy amongst the
prisoners, who strode here and there, hectoring the weak, browbeating the strong, and fawning,
perhaps, upon those fortunate enough to be possessed of a store of money.  Bitterly did the
two young fellows regret the chances which had brought them to Berlin, and had found them there
at the outbreak of war; for, indeed, it was but a chance which had taken them to the Kaiser's city.

Let us explain how it happened that these two young men were of such distinctly British appearance.
After all, there was nothing extraordinary about that fact, nothing particularly unusual, for
in Paris, for years past, there has been a sufficiency of British tailors to turn out every
young man after the latest British fashion.  But it was more than clothes in the case of these
two young men, more than mere dress, that made them so conspicuously British; it was environment,
in fact, training and education; it was the result of the intuition of their parents.

"France is all right, my boy," Monsieur de Farquissaire had told Henri when he was quite a
lad, "France is a splendid country, and, if you are but like your fellows when you reach man's
age, neither you nor I will have anything to complain of.  But there is good in other nationalities,
and there is great advantage to one among our people who both speaks the language, say, of
England, and, better even than that, understands her people and has inside knowledge of them.
So you will go to an English university once you have left your school in Paris."

As a matter of strict fact, Henri had left his school in Paris when only fifteen years of age,
and had crossed the Channel to become one of the inmates of a public school famous throughout
Great Britain.  It was there that he had learned to speak like a native, and, better still,
it was there that he had learned, unconsciously, quite easily in fact, to behave just as did
his fellows, to speak as they did, quietly, without undue or exaggerated action, to play their
games, to understand and practise their codes of honour; and so faithful and diligent a student
was he, so heartily did he enter into the work and games of that public school, that, when
in due course he went to a university, he was mistaken, just as he had been at the moment of
the opening of this story, for a British subject, an essentially insular individual.

As for Jules, when one has described the appearance and the life-history, though only a short
one so far, of the energetic Henri, one has practically described that of his companion.  For
Jules and Henri were born next-door to one another, were chums from their earliest boyhood,
and, thanks to the intimate friendship of their parents, had the same course marked out for
them.  Jules, then, followed Henri to that public school in England, followed him to the university,
was like him in his fancy for British ways and British customs, and followed him yet again,
indeed went in his company, on that journey to Berlin which immersed them in this misfortune.

And there they were, interned in Ruhleben, impounded, corralled if you like, separated from
their countrymen by ghastly fences of barbed wire, and by a nation composed of men and women
who, almost without exception, would, if they were to discover them outside their prison, most
eagerly tear them to pieces.

"But it's got to be done!" Jules said, as he and Henri sat outside the stable, the wooden hovel,
indeed, in which they lived, in which they bedded down at night in stalls once occupied by
horses, and now merely strewed with straw, cruelly cold and unfit for human habitation.

"And the sooner we set about it the better.  We'll have to harden our hearts," said Henri,
looking very determined and attempting to twist the ends of his miniature moustache; "we'll
have to save our food for the journey."

Jules shivered.  He wasn't a greedy young man, nor could his appetite be described as unusually
large, but he was hungry.  Hungry then, at the moment when Henri spoke of saving rations, hungry
at night, hungry when he had had his food, hungry always.  He was like every member of the
unfortunate crowd now inhabiting the race-course at Ruhleben, he was short of food--for the
Germans were the harshest of captors.  And how could a man save sufficient from a mere crust
of bread?  How could he put away from rations, already and for so long insufficient, even a
crumb per diem to carry him on during some coming journey?

"Yes, it's got to be done," said Henri, with determination; "and, what's more, we shall have
to save money.  We are getting a little already: I had a few marks sent through from Paris
only last week, while we have both got a few notes tucked away in our clothing.  But it's not
money, however, which will help us; not even food.  It will be our wits, which will have to
be brisk, I can tell you."

Looking about them as they sat near their hovel, both knew that the words were abundantly true,
for where was there a loophole in those barbed-wire fences?  Where was there an opportunity
to break out of this prison?  Yet the chance came, came unexpectedly, came after some weeks
of waiting and despondency, came at a moment, in fact, when it found Jules and Henri almost
unready, unprepared to seize a golden opportunity.

CHAPTER II

Henri and Jules and Stuart

There was a hue and cry in the camp of Ruhleben which caused heads to be thrust out of doors
and out of windows, made prisoners who had been languishing in the place for months start to
their feet and look enquiringly about them, and set a German official turning round and round
like a teetotum--his moustaches bristling, his hair on end, amazed at the din and fearful for
the cause of it.  It all commenced with a sudden shout, and then was emphasized by the explosion
of a rifle.  A dull thud followed as a bullet struck one of the huts and perforated it, and
then a dozen weapons went off, the somewhat aged guardians of the camp losing their heads and
blazing away without aim and without authority.

"What's up?  What's happened?  Why is there firing?"

"Shooting a prisoner, eh?  Brutes--they'd do anything!  Mon Dieu!  What will happen next?"

The first speaker was a delicate, pale-faced, spectacled Breton; the second, a vivacious individual
from Paris, who, like Henri and Jules, had had the misfortune to be in Germany when the war
broke out.  Their eager questions were followed by the somewhat phlegmatic and casual words
of an Englishman--a red-headed, red-cheeked, healthy-looking individual, who, in spite of short
commons, still looked bulky.

"Someone's lost his head," he said caustically, with a growl, sitting up and looking about
him.  "I'll get the reason in two guesses: someone's trying to escape, or someone has escaped."

Something very dreadful might really have happened, judging by the commotion in the camp, by
the shouts of the sentries, and by the firing.  The Governor himself--living aloof from the
individuals interned in the place and under his administration--heard the racket and came out,
buttoning up his tunic, alarmed, his thoughts in a whirl, eager to discover what had given
rise to the commotion; and Henri and Jules, like the rest of their companions, were, as one
may imagine, just as curious and just as eager.

"Whatever the ruction is, whatever the cause, the point where it commenced is over there, behind
those huts in the far corner," said the former, watching the German guards race across the
place and listening to their shouts and to the loud commands of the non-commissioned officers
amongst them.  "Let's saunter in that direction.  Come along."

And saunter they did, being joined in a little while by a number of people interned in the
camp; and amongst them by the red-headed, red-cheeked, and healthy-looking individual who boasted,
somewhat loudly it is to be feared at times, of his English nationality.  Not that such boastings
disgusted the unhappy people interned at Ruhleben, for it did them good in those days of depression
to hear a man--a robust man such as this individual--proud of his birth, and still possessed
of sufficient spirit to glory in it, to draw comparisons between himself, his French, his Belgian,
and his Japanese fellow-prisoners, and Germans in general, The man's swagger, in fact, delighted
them, and helped to bolster up the fading spirits of many an unfortunate captive in the camp--of
many a man, who, but for the jibes and uncomplimentary remarks of this robust prisoner, would
long since have given up hope and have subsided into melancholy.

"What a row!" he scoffed, as side by side with Jules and Henri he sauntered across the compound.
"No, don't you hurry, you fellows, for there's never any knowing what will happen in these
days.  Those German guards have lost their heads, and the chances are that, if in your curiosity
you happen to step along too quickly or to run, they'd imagine that a mutiny had broken out,
and would blaze away at you. Lor' what a commotion!"

By now some twenty of the German guards--those Landsturm men of perhaps fifty years of age--had
collected in the opposite corner, at the point where the alarm had first been given, and could
be seen, grouped together, gesticulating, shouting at one another, peering into the corner
of the compound, and carrying on in a manner which accentuated, if anything, the curiosity
of the prisoners.

"One could imagine anything," laughed Henri as they got nearer.  "For instance, you could imagine
that one of the fellows interned here, goaded to rashness by these bullies who look after us,
had struck one of them."

"Yes, that's not at all unlikely.  Goaded to madness, one of the poor chaps may have put his
fist into the face of a German guard, and that shot would have been the result; of course,
the poor beggar would be killed instantly, for your German is nothing if not ruthless.  He's
armed, you see, and is the stronger party, and knows that the authorities won't look too harshly
on any drastic action."

"Hold on!  Perhaps it's not a case of an assault on one of the guards," chimed in the healthy
Englishman, Stuart by name.  "I've said already that I'd guess the reason in two guesses--someone
trying to escape, or someone already escaped--and I stick to that opinion.  Let's hope it's
someone escaped--lucky beggar!  Here have I been kicking my heels about this infernal camp
for months past, looking round for a chance to get out, ready to 'do in' a German guard if
the opportunity came.  But, bless you, there's never been the remotest chance, for these Germans
keep their eyes so precious wide open.  As for 'doing in' a guard, why, I'd do in half a dozen;
for, believe me, it'd want a good half-dozen Germans to stop me, once I saw the hole open through
which I could get out."

It wasn't altogether undiluted brag on the part of this sturdy fellow--mere boasting of what
he would do under particular conditions which were never likely to arise.  A glance at him,
indeed, rather helped to support his statements, for Stuart, though somewhat attenuated after
those months of internment at Ruhleben, after months of short commons and indifferent accommodation,
was still a big bony fellow of some twenty-five years of age, with broad shoulders, long arms
and legs, and a chest which would have fitted a Hercules.  True, there were hollows in his
cheeks, and his eyes were gaunt and sunken, yet what man in that camp of suffering, what man
amongst all the unfortunate fellows caught in Germany at the outbreak of war and hustled to
Ruhleben, did not, long since, show signs of suffering and anxiety and of want, often of destitution.
As a matter of fact, the robust Stuart had stood the privations of the place better than the
majority of his fellows; and perhaps his very jauntiness of spirit, the courage which sustained
him and helped also to sustain his comrades, kept him from feeling his position so acutely,
and helped also to assist him in surviving a state of affairs which to some had long since
become intolerable, which indeed was killing not a few by inches.

By now the trio had crossed the compound, and were within a few feet of their guards, who,
absorbed in whatever had caused the alarm and had sent them rushing to that corner, seemed
to overlook the prisoners--all the men about them--seemed to be unaware of the crowd collecting
in that quarter.  They were gathered in the far corner, just outside one of the many huts erected
there--a sorry affair, which at one time had done duty on the race-course as a tool-shed. 
In those days it would not have been considered good enough even for the dogs of the owners
of German race-horses; but now, yes, it was good enough--too good--for these enemy prisoners,
for these individuals snatched from amongst the civil population of Germany.  Young men, some
of them, hale men in those days before the war; elderly men, invalids from some of Germany's
health resorts--harmless individuals in numerous cases, who, had they been Germans and in England,
would have been left alone, able to live their lives in peace and security, provided they obeyed
certain rules and regulations of a not too drastic nature; but in Germany German "frightfulness"
allowed of no leniency even to sick men.  And here they were, the hale, the young, the sick,
and the old, hustled to Ruhleben, and herded there together in such an old shed as the one
in this far corner.  Many men brought up in luxury in France or in England, needing care and
comfort because of the state of their health, and undoubtedly quite harmless individuals, were
forced to find such accommodation during those dreary months of later 1914 and the months which
followed as this World War went on.

It happened, too, that amongst the people interned at this place were a number of jockeys and
racing people, employed up to the date of the war by German masters, and detained in the country.
These--perhaps a dozen of them--had been posted to the very hut round which the German guards
were then standing, and, as Henri and Jules came upon the scene, could be observed within the
ring of guards, cowering, looking askance at the Germans, and evidently in sore trouble.

"One of our jockey friends then is the culprit," said Jules; "it's one of the racing-men who
has been goaded to madness."

"And has been shot by a German guard?" asked Henri.

"Not a bit of it, not a bit of it!" exclaimed Stuart; "there has been no shooting here.  Just
listen to the questions being asked.  I know German sufficiently to be able to tell what's
passing, and those German guards are asking how the work commenced, who thought of the idea,
and who was the ring-leader?  If that isn't connected with an attempt at escape, call me a
Dutchman.  No, no; don't call me a German," he said sotto voce in Henri's ear, grimacing as
he did so; "don't call me that, my boy, or you will be in trouble."

Certainly the German guards were asking many questions; they were firing them off by the hundred
almost, they were shouting them at their prisoners and at one another, till there was such
a babel that no one could answer and few could understand.  It was not, indeed, until a non-commissioned
officer of burly form and bullying appearance came upon the scene that the commotion ended,
and some sort of order was introduced.

"Stop this brawling," he bellowed, thrusting his way in amongst the guards and pushing them
unceremoniously to either side.  "What's this racket?  Who fired the shot?  Quick, answer!"

A somewhat startled-looking individual, a man with grey beard and rotund body, who before the
onset of the war may have anticipated well enough that he would never again be called to the
colours, advanced somewhat timidly from behind his comrades and drew himself up stiffly at
attention.  Yet not stiffly enough, not with that snap which is characteristic of the younger
German.  The non-commissioned officer coughed and snorted, and looked the man over with a threatening
eye which set the fellow trembling.

"Ha!  Ho!  It is you, eh?  You fired the shot--you?" and there was a note of contempt in his
voice.  "Then why?  On whose orders?  Here are the orders of the day as to the duties of a
sentry, and as to the occasions on which he shall use a rifle.  Listen, I will read them."

It was a sample of German militarism which the Sergeant was reproducing to the full, a sample
of the preciseness of the Teuton.  Keeping this elderly guard at attention till the poor fellow
looked as though he would explode, he groped in the pocket in the tail of his tunic, and, producing
a notebook, proceeded to extricate from it a sheet of paper on which were some typewritten
lines; and then in a ponderous and somewhat menacing voice he read the orders--orders which
set forth exactly and minutely when a guard should come on duty and when he should be relieved,
what reports he should prepare, and what he was to observe amongst the prisoners.  Finally,
having elaborated a number of minor points, it set forth the orders as to using firearms.

"And shall not fire upon the prisoners unless there be occasion," coughed the Sergeant; "that
is to say, unless there is insubordination amongst them, mutiny, a threat to strike, or an
endeavour to escape. That is the gist of the orders.  Now, my friend, you have either obeyed
or you have disobeyed your orders.  Your report!  You fired a shot. Why?  Under what heading?"

No wonder the unfortunate and rotund guard who had set the camp in an uproar flushed till he
became quite scarlet, till his face swelled to the point of bursting, and until his eyes looked
as though they would fall out of his astonished head.  He stuttered and coughed, and stood
at ease, for the effort to remain at attention was beyond him.

"Halt!  Stand to attention!" thundered the non-commissioned officer. "Now, your report.  There
was incipient mutiny amongst the prisoners, eh?"

The guard shook his head and spluttered; even now he was unable to command so much as a single
word.

"No!  Then there was insubordination amongst a number, or in the case of a single individual, eh?"

"Not so," the guard managed to stutter; "not so, Sergeant."

"Ah!  Then we get nearer to it.  A man struck you, or threatened to do so?"

"No, it was not that," the German standing to attention managed to answer; "not that, Sergeant."

"What, then?  Then it was someone attempting an escape?  Someone trying to break out of Ruhleben!"
shouted the Sergeant--bellowed it, in fact--when he saw that the guard was nodding his head
emphatically. "You mean to tell me that you have stood there all these minutes, and allowed
me to read the orders of the day, and to cross-examine you, without giving so much as a hint
as to the real cause of the firing of your rifle?  You mean to say that you have allowed all
this delay, well knowing that a prisoner is attempting or had made an escape, and thereby have
assisted him to make clean away from this prison?"

It was the non-commissioned officer's turn almost to explode with indignation and anger; he
towered above the trembling guard as he thundered at him, and might still have been abusing
him and threatening him had it not been that at that moment another individual came upon the
scene--a short, spare, dried-up fellow, a lieutenant, one risen from the ranks not long ago,
and still retaining all the bullying ways of a non-commissioned officer.  If the burly sergeant
had jostled the guards unceremoniously to either side, had stamped on their feet, had threatened
and browbeaten them, the new-comer was tenfold more violent and domineering.  If looks could
have slaughtered individuals, the glance he cast at the sergeant would have slain that perspiring
and angry person in an instant, while the scathing glances cast at the group of guards would
have decimated the whole party.  Yet, if this under-officer's looks were terrible, if he were
still more threatening than the non-commissioned officer, he was at least practical, and quick
to get to the bottom of matters.

"Stop this racket!" he commanded abruptly, snapping the words like pistol-shots at those round
him.  "There was an alarm; it started with a rifle-shot--I know all that, so you needn't report
it.  Stop!" he commanded, seeing the non-commissioned officer open his mouth as if to describe
what had happened.  "A rifle-shot gave the alarm--something caused one of the guards to fire.
This man here undoubtedly is the man who did so.  Sergeant, you have called for his report?
You have been here a good five minutes--what's the report?"

"A prisoner escaping.  This fool here has kept the knowledge from me until this very moment,
and I have only just managed to drag the information from him.  I have----"

"Hold!" snapped the officer.  "I am not asking what you did; I am asking what caused the sentry
to fire.  A prisoner escaping, you tell me--he's gone then; you've ascertained that fact?"

"I--I--he--you----"

The non-commissioned officer was utterly taken aback, and it was his turn now to look askance
at this dried-up, sinister-looking under-officer.  If the unfortunate and aged guard who had
fired that shot had been remiss in making a rapid report--remissness excusable enough considering
the violence of the Sergeant--the latter had been more remiss in not pursuing the matter more
rapidly.  He knew it, and knew that the under-officer already condemned him.  Moreover, with
that under-officer, he was well aware, excuses would not avail him.

"I was going to----"

"That will do," the officer told him.  "Whatever you were going to do was not your duty.  You
have been delaying a report; I will deal with you later in the Commandant's office.  Now, my
friend," he began, turning upon the trembling guard, "a prisoner was escaping; I will ask the
question that should have been asked at the very commencement: you fired a shot--you killed
the man, eh?--so that he did not escape, or you stopped him?"

There was the dawn of a smile actually on the face of the rotund guard who had been so odiously
browbeaten by the Sergeant.  It was his turn, he felt, his turn to be jubilant, and at the
expense of the man who had bullied him so abominably.  He was, in fact, helping to turn the
tables on the Sergeant, and hastened to assist the officer.

"I was about to report the matter, sir," he said.  "A prisoner was escaping, but failed.  I
did not shoot him, because it was not possible, seeing that he was out of sight and underground.
I therefore fired my rifle to give an alarm and to call assistance.  Meanwhile I stood guard
over the opening, which I discovered by mere accident.  In the hut, there, sir, there is a
hole beneath the boards laid on the floor, and a tunnel leading from it.  It is not my duty
to enter the huts, and, in fact, the orders of sentries are emphatic on that point; we are
to patrol outside though, and not to venture farther unless there is a commotion.  But it is
the duty of the non-commissioned officer in whose charge a hut may be to see that the prisoners
keep the place tidy, to watch them carefully, and to observe if they show signs of an attempted
escape."

"Hah!"  The fierce little dried-up under-officer actually smiled--smiled at this stout sentry,
smiled at him, and, indeed, almost winked.  For, in an instant, he had realized what was happening,
how by this last statement the guard was implicating the Sergeant, who had been so recently
upbraiding him.  To speak the truth, he was no lover of the non-commissioned officer either;
and in days gone by--not so very long ago either--when he, too, had been of the non-commissioned
officers' ranks, and had enjoyed but little seniority over the Sergeant, he had had occasion
to complain of his bullying, of his arrogance, and of his unpleasant gibes and innuendoes.
It was an opportunity then to be snatched at, both for the sake of himself and of this somewhat
ancient sentry, who, whatever he might be, however stupid, was essentially harmless.

"So," he began, "that is as you say, my friend; it is not your duty to enter any of the enclosures,
but to march to and fro and to keep an eye on the prisoners.  It is for the sergeant in charge
of each of the huts to carry out his duties, and to detect any and every effort to escape.
Then who is the sergeant in charge of this place outside which we are standing?"

There was silence amongst the group, a deathly silence, during which the aged Landsturm sentry
pulled himself up stiffly at attention, or into the nearest approach to that position to which
he could attain, and smiled covertly in the direction of the sergeant who had browbeaten him.
Others of those somewhat senile guards, who at the sound of their officer's voice had assumed
that position of respect demanded of all German soldiers, also cast swift glances in the same
direction, and even went so far--seeing that the snappy little officer's back was turned and
his attention otherwise engaged--as to grin quite openly, and smirk, as they watched the flaming
face of the Sergeant.  As for the latter, perspiration was pouring from beneath his helmet,
the man's hands were twitching, while his eyes were rolling in the most horrible manner.  He
was cornered, he knew, and guessed thoroughly that the opportunity thus discovered, thanks
to the sentry and to his own bullying manner, would be taken advantage of.

"Who, then, is the sergeant responsible?" asked the officer in cold, unsympathetic tones, looking
the unfortunate sergeant over from the spike of his Pickelhaube to the thick soles of his regulation
boots. "Surely not this sergeant?  Surely not the non-commissioned officer before me--the one
so quick to find fault with a sentry who seems to have been doing only his duty?  Surely not!"

And yet a glance at his face showed well enough that he knew that the culprit stood before
him; moreover, that he was determined to make the most of the opportunity.

"I--we--this fool here----" began the Sergeant, spluttering, confused, and now just as thoroughly
frightened as had been the victim he had pounced upon such a little time before.

"Stop!" snapped the officer; "you are under arrest; go back to your quarters.  Now, my man,
you fired your rifle to stop a man from escaping.  Narrate the circumstances, and quickly,
for, for all I know, the rascal may be even now continuing the attempt."

At that the sentry smiled--smiled boldly too, when he saw the discomfiture of the Sergeant.
Turning half-right abruptly, till he faced the entrance of the hut, he pointed towards it,
and shook his grizzly head  knowingly.

"It was like this, sir," he said, with an air of triumph, "I was passing to and fro on my beat,
noting nothing out of the ordinary, until there came a moment when I was opposite this hut,
almost on the precise spot on which I am now standing, when I heard sounds which attracted
my notice--heavy sounds, the noise of men digging.  There was no sergeant in sight, no one
responsible for the hut to whom I could appeal, yet a glance within showed me an opening in
the floor, covered as a rule by boards, which were now removed.  There was a man in the hole,
deep down and beyond it, in a tunnel, a man whose figure I could only just discern--a ruffian
who was attempting to dig his way from the hut out beyond the wire entanglements.  It was then,
seeing there was no one here to support me, that I fired my rifle."

"Ha!  And the fellow is there still?" demanded the officer quickly.

"Still, your honour, unless he has escaped during the time the Sergeant cross-questioned me;
of a truth, he is still there, unless, perhaps, he should have in the meantime, while I was
delayed in executing my duty, contrived to clamber out of the opening."

"Close in, you men," bellowed the officer; "half a dozen of you come along with me, and hold
your rifles ready.  Now, into the hut and let us capture these fellows."

Closing round the entrance to the hovel--termed a hut--in which the unfortunate interned aliens
had been forced to live for months, the sentries watched the officer and a few of their comrades
push their way into the interior, heard them stamping on the boards, and listened to the peremptory
orders of the former.

"Come out, you ruffian, or ruffians," he bellowed.  "We have you securely, and any further
attempt at escape will be met with instant execution.  Ah!  I can see a man down below.  Go
in, two of you men, and haul him up to the surface."

With no great show of enthusiasm, stiffly, and with a lack of energy and that activity to be
expected of younger men, two of the guards at once lowered themselves into the pit dug beneath
the boards which did duty as a flooring to this hovel, and, disappearing from sight in the
tunnel excavated from the bottom of it, were presently heard giving expression to gruff commands,
while the sound of scuffling followed. Then they reappeared, dragging a couple of dishevelled
and exceedingly dirty prisoners with them.  Others of the guards then stepped forward, and
in a trice the wretched men who had been detected in the act of escaping were dragged from
the hole, were placed between sentries, and were marched out of the hut.

Meanwhile, as may be imagined, the excitement in the camp had not tended to decrease, for curiosity
had been added to it.  There was a throng of prisoners round the hut long since, watching at
first the altercation between the Sergeant and the sentry, and then observing and listening
to all that followed.

"A pretty kettle of fish--eh?" sneered Stuart, the healthy Britisher. "Sorry for those poor
beggars; for their rations have been short enough already, and now, if they are not shot, they
will get close confinement and bread and water only for a couple of weeks or more.  Bad luck!
Horribly bad luck!  Just at the last, too, for it looks as though they were well on the way
to safety."

"Now, report," suddenly came the voice of the little officer, as he glowered upon the prisoners.
"You two who went into the tunnel report on its length, its depth.  Bah!  You didn't look!
You didn't ascertain that!  Wait while I investigate the matter."

Seizing an electric torch from one of the hapless prisoners, the officer dropped into the pit
immediately and was gone for some few minutes, only to emerge again, dirty like the prisoners,
but triumphant instead of crestfallen, his face beaming, his eyes sparkling with happiness.
So pleased was he that he even went to the length of patting that stout, rotund sentry on the
shoulder as soon as he had emerged into the open.

"A fine catch," he told him, "bravely done, my friend!  See, you detected them just at the
very right moment, for the dusk is already growing, and in five minutes or less they would
have been in the open. Let me tell you, that tunnel was not prepared in a day or two, or even
in a week, I am certain.  It is the work of days and days, grim, hard work, and has been carried
right up beyond the hut and under the wire entanglements.  There it stops, though already it
was rising to the surface, and to-morrow morning, when we investigate the place, I feel sure
that a thrust with a bar will break a way into the open.  March the prisoners across to the
guard-room; and you, my friend, come along and make your report to the Commandant.  Ha!  What
are all these rascals doing here?  Curious, eh?  Get back to your stables!"

There was an instant move on the part of the prisoners interned in the camp, who had collected
in this corner to see what was passing. Turning about promptly--for to disobey an order when
under the thumb of Germans was to court a shot from a rifle--they went off briskly in the dusk
to their own particular huts, while behind them was heard the sharp command of the sergeant
in charge of the sentries, the tramp of heavy feet, and the passage of the sentries and prisoners
in the direction of the guard-room.

"Come along," said Stuart, his hands deep in his pockets, his head held forward, his chin on
his breast.  "I'm frightfully sorry for those poor fellows.  Just fancy!  To be within, say,
a foot of freedom and then to fall, and then to be detected by the merest mischance."

"Within a foot of freedom!  That's what that officer said," Henri was muttering to himself.
"Just a foot, just a thrust of an iron bar, and then to safety, freedom--freedom from this
prison.  Why not!"

"Why not?" he asked suddenly, clutching Jules's coat.

"What?  Why not?" the latter asked.  "Don't understand."

"Why not complete the work?  Those fellows have done precisely what we should have done--they've
dug a hole and have run a tunnel from the bottom of it out below the open and below the entanglements.
It's there--ready for anyone who wants to get out of this place.  Anyone, Jules!  Don't you
understand?"

Stuart grabbed at Henri, and thrust his big, healthy face close up to his.  He was breathing
deeply, in heavy gusts, and, but for the gathering darkness, it would have been seen that his
eyes were shining, while he showed every sign of excitement.

"Why not?  You fellows were thinking of making an escape?" he asked.

"Certainly," Henri told him; "we've been saving our grub, and what money we could get.  We
were ready but for the method, and now it's there--there in that hut--quite close to us, and
it's dark enough, and--and--and there's no one about--why not?"

"Come on," said Stuart abruptly, in that resolute way he had.  "I'm with you fellows, if you'll
have me."

Without another word the trio turned promptly, and, looking round to make sure that no one
had observed them, they bolted back to the hut from which those unfortunate prisoners had been
dragged, and, closing the door behind them, leapt into the pit and made their way into the
tunnel.  Freedom lay before them--freedom for which they pined--freedom to be had if only they
could break their way into the open.

CHAPTER III

The Road to Freedom

"What's this?  An old shovel, by the feel of it--the thing they've dug the tunnel with," Henri
told his comrades as they stood at the entrance of the tunnel in the dense darkness, and felt
all about them.  "My fingers dropped upon it as I bent at the entrance, and, yes--here's a
basket with a rope attached to it, into which, no doubt, one of them shovelled the earth at
the far end of the tunnel, while his comrade dragged it to the bottom of the pit by means of
the rope.  Poor chaps! How hard they must have worked, and what a disappointment it must have
been to have failed just at the last moment."

"That's just what we have got to look to," Stuart told them in a hoarse whisper.  "They've
done the work and have failed; let's look to it that we get out promptly.  Come along now.
Give me the spade, Henri, for I'm bigger and stronger than you, and, if there's only a foot
of earth above our heads when we get to the far end of the tunnel, I'll bash a way through
it without difficulty.  George!  What a narrow space it is! It hardly lets my shoulders through."

That tunnel, indeed, was hardly better than a rabbit burrow.  Perhaps four to five feet in
height, it was scarcely two in breadth, cold and dark and winding.  Let us admit at once that
it required no small stock of courage on the part of Stuart and his friends to force their
way along it, particularly so in the case of the Englishman, whose frame was such a close fit
to the damp earthen sides, that failure to break a way out at the far end would have left him
in a difficult position--one from which he would undoubtedly have found it hard to extricate
himself.  Yet there was liberty beyond, escape from this dreary Ruhleben with its monotonous
routine, with its bullying Commandant and guards, with its sordid surroundings, and its sorry
accommodation and short commons.  Thrusting on, therefore, pushing his way along the tunnel,
squeezing himself into as small a compass as possible, Stuart forced a passage deeper into
it, one hand feeling his way, while the other gripped the implement which Henri had discovered.
Ten yards, twenty, perhaps thirty were covered before a growl came from the leader.

"The end!" they heard him say.  "I'm up against the far end of the tunnel, and that officer
was quite right when he stated that it rose toward this end.  Now, hold your breath for a moment
and listen while I thump the roof.  There--hollow--eh?  Not much earth above us.  Then stand
back a little whilst I make a stroke for the open."

They heard the thuds as the shovel was dashed against the roof, and listened to clods of earth
and debris falling.  It was precisely at the fifth stroke that a grunt escaped Stuart, while
an instant later Henri felt a breath of fresh air, a cold gust sweeping past him.

"The open!" he exclaimed.  "Go easy, Stuart, for it might not be dark enough yet, and impatience
on our part might lead to our instant discovery.  Put your head up quietly as soon as you've
made room."

There were more grunts in front, while from behind came a low, warning exclamation from Jules.

"S--s--sh!" he said.  "I can hear someone in the hut behind us, for the sounds are travelling
down the tunnel.  Push on into the open as fast as you can go, while I turn back and see what's
happening."

There were more sounds then, as Jules, less bulky than Stuart, yet of formidable size when
it came to free movement in this narrow tunnel, contrived by some acrobatic feat to turn himself
about and face the pit from which they had started this adventure.  Then he crawled back towards
the hut on all fours, listening to the suspicious sounds which he had heard, wondering who
caused them, fearing that the German guards had come to make a nearer investigation of the
pit and tunnel.  Yes, it was that, without a doubt; for there came to his ears now the sound
of a man's two feet alighting at the bottom of the pit, a heavy thud, and the fall of earth
as it tumbled from the sides of the pit to the bottom.  Then rays of light reached him as the
person who had dropped into the pit switched on an electric torch and surveyed his surroundings.
Once more then Jules performed that acrobatic feat, and, twisting himself round with furious
energy, hastened back to warn his comrades.

"There's a fellow at the bottom of the pit already, and no doubt he'll be coming into the tunnel,"
he told them in a whisper.  "He's got an electric torch, and that will be far worse than the
light outside, for it'll show us up directly.  Shove on into the open.  Push your way through.
Hang the sentries!  We'll have to chance their seeing us."

More blows came from Stuart, lusty blows, and the sound of heavy breathing, then an exclamation,
an exclamation of delight, of triumph, and later the sound of more earth falling.  That fresh
breath of air which had swept into the tunnel became almost keen, while intuitively, for they
could not see, Henri and Jules both realized that Stuart had already clambered from the place
into the open.

"Come now," they heard a voice.  "Come up, quick, and lie down flat as soon as you are beside me."

Henri stumbled on till he was right at the end of the tunnel, and, standing upright, felt a
hand stretched down towards him.  Gripping it, digging his toes into the sides of the tunnel,
and seizing the edge above with his other hand, he was half dragged, and half forced his way
upward, then, flinging himself on the ground beside Stuart, he leant over the ragged hole and
helped to extricate his comrade.

They were free!  They were in the open!  They were beyond the wire entanglements!  And Germany
lay before them--Germany, an enemy country, where every man's hand, aye, and every woman's
too, would be against them.  Yet they were free, and what did it matter how many enemies they
had to face, how many difficulties were before them?  For freedom, however much it might be
embarrassed, however adventurous it might become, was freedom after all--a godsend compared
with the privations, the gibes, the cruel treatment they had suffered in their prison.  If
anyone had ever a doubt as to this, if, when this ghastly war which is now in progress is finished,
a reader happen to think that there has been exaggeration in these statements, let him but
look to facts, let him but consult the known history of the treatment of interned aliens and
prisoners of war in the Kaiser's country.  Though war itself, and this one in particular with
its long and terrible tale of casualties, is a ghastly business, the deliberate ill-treatment,
the calculated starvation, and the wilful abandonment to misery and death from preventable
disease of prisoners of war is a still more ghastly affair--an episode frequently repeated
in the case of Germany.

"Out!  Hurrah!  Mon Dieu!  Out of that awful hole," coughed Henri, shaking the dirt out of
his hair and brushing it from behind his ears. "Out, my boys!  Away from those German guards,
and away from that Commandant and the whole breed of 'em."

Jules giggled.  He was possessed of a lighter nature altogether, was perhaps of more flippant
disposition than his chum, and had less stamina about him.  Not that he was lacking in courage,
or in dash, or in that élan which the French generally have displayed so magnificently in this
conflict, only Jules was, perhaps, just a trifle effeminate, and giggles seemed to come almost
naturally from him.  Now, as he lay close to the ragged edge of the opening through which he
had been forcibly dragged by Stuart and Henri, and as he spluttered and blew dirt which had
introduced itself into his mouth from his discoloured lips, he gave vent to a laugh, a smothered
sound of merriment, perhaps a semi-hysterical giggle, in any case to a sound which grated on
the senses of the Englishman terribly.

"Burr!  Stop that!" he commanded, and somehow, for some unascertained reason, Henri and Jules,
who would have resented such tones from him on any other occasion, accepted them now without
a murmur.  "Shut up!" growled Stuart.  "Hist!  There's one of those beastly sentries coming
near the entanglements--and what's that?"

There were other sounds than those of steps within Ruhleben camp, that odious place of misery
out of which they had broken, other noises than the heavy tramp of a ponderous Landsturm guard
as he strode from behind the hut till the barbed-wire entanglements stopped his progress and
he rattled his bayonet upon it, sounds which came from another quarter from beneath the ground,
from the tunnel in fact from which Henri and his friends had so recently emerged.

"Hist!" exclaimed Stuart in warning tones.  "Keep as low and as flat as you can.  Thank goodness!
That sentry fellow, after making enough noise to drown the sound of our voices, has turned
away without seeing us; but--but--what's that?"

Henri stretched out a hand and gripped him by the sleeve.

"Down there," he whispered, "down there in the tunnel from which we have just come, there's
someone stumbling along.  And cast your eye into the opening; isn't that the gleam of a torch?
Isn't that light being thrown in this direction?"

It was, without the shadow of doubt.  For, as all three peered over the edge of the hole they
had made so rapidly, thanks to the strength of Stuart, the depths below were illuminated for
just a few seconds, and then were hidden in pitch-black darkness, which within a few moments
was again lit up by a brilliant beam of light coming from a distance up the tunnel--that long
path which they had followed, which had fitted the burly Stuart's shoulders so narrowly, and
had made turning in his case an impossibility.  It acted now as a tube, and sent sounds along
towards them, accentuated them, indeed, until there was no difficulty in deciding that a man
was struggling and pushing his way towards them--a man armed with an electric torch, a fellow
who breathed heavily, who swore beneath his breath and then out loud, and who set masses of
earth tumbling down about him.

"Better go," whispered Henri, when the cause of the sounds was quite certain, "better slip
away at once before the fellow finds the opening and shouts an alarm."

"Wait!"  Stuart stretched a hand out and gripped him with a grip of iron, a grip which held
the vivacious Frenchman to the ground.  "Not yet, for that bounder of a sentry is again coming
towards us.  Lie low!" he cautioned them; "lie low, or he will see us."

"But the man below with the light--he is nearer, far nearer," said Jules, who lay with his
head well over the opening.  "He'll be here in next to no time--then what?"

Stuart dragged himself a little closer to that opening, and, keeping one eye on the sentry,
glanced down to the bottom of the tunnel.

"Leave the beggar to me," he said.  "Look here, Henri, grope about for a stone--a brick--anything
that's hard and will hurt, and can be thrown easily.  Ah! here's one--a big 'un too; you try
the same, Jules, and get ready to heave at that sentry.  When I bash my fist against the fellow
below, you throw your stones as hard as you can at the German inside the entanglements, and
so put out his aim; not that there's much to be feared, seeing how dark it is at this moment."

Quick as thought, Henri grabbed the big stone which Stuart thrust into his hand, and, groping
about, quickly secured another.  Then he slowly raised himself into a kneeling position, ready
to spring to his feet and carry out the duty Stuart had given him.  Nor was it likely to be
a very difficult matter to strike the sentry at that moment hammering again on the barbed wire
which formed the fences about the camp at Ruhleben, for though without doubt Henri and his
friends lay invisible, close to the ground, the burly figure of the German stood out, huge
and broad and solid, silhouetted faintly in the darkness by lights flickering from the range
of shelters on the far side of the camp.  As for Jules, he, too, quickly secured missiles with
which to bombard the sentry, and, as if to show how ready he was for the work in hand, gave
vent again to one of those subdued giggles; whereat Stuart growled--a fierce growl--and nudged
him violently.  Then, of a sudden, the attention of all three was fixed on the hole through
which they had emerged, and upon the depths below it.  The rough sides of the tunnel, the debris
and earth which they themselves had dragged down to the foot of it as they cut their path upward,
every stone, every clod, was visible, as the torch--now closer at hand--lit up every crevice.
Then the torch itself came into view, the hand which gripped it, the sleeve about the wrist,
and finally the shoulders and the head of the individual stumbling and forcing his way towards
them.

"Ach, Himmel!  What a find!  The wretches were almost escaping.  What perseverance, though;
what hard work; and, yes, what hard luck to have been discovered just on the eve of breaking
out of their prison!"

It was the small, snappy under-officer who had appeared on the scene outside the hut but a
few minutes earlier, and who, discovering the Sergeant there browbeating the unfortunate sentry,
had turned upon him like a dog, had snapped at his heels as it were, had changed the aspect
of affairs entirely, and had ended in putting the non-commissioned officer under arrest, and
in himself capturing those unlucky prisoners who were hiding in the tunnel.

Doubtless it was a brilliant evening's work for him--work which might even bring him reward--who
knows?--might even, in the end, bring him that Iron Cross which the Kaiser has been so fond
of distributing.  Men in the ranks of the German army had received that reward for lesser acts
than that of the under-officer this evening; there are heroes in the armies of the All-Highest
Kaiser who have been decorated with that Iron Cross for valour, and others who wear the emblem
for deeds which make the rest of civilization shudder.  Yes, indeed, the under-officer might
well earn such reward, for he had shown acuteness, promptitude, and dispatch in carrying out
his duties.

"But what's this?" Henri and Stuart and Jules heard him say, a second later, as his other hand
came into view, groping along the floor of the tunnel and plunging deep into the loose soil
so recently pulled from the roof above.  "The tunnel ends abruptly, and above--what's this?--above,
the ruffians were making a hole.  But this is strange, for when I entered before there was
no sign of such a thing.  The tunnel ended just here, as it does now, and the earth at its
foot was hard and beaten, while above it was hard as well, but shook and gave out a hollow
sound.  What's this?  Ah!  A hole."

It was with amazement that his eyes fell upon the ragged edge of the opening above, as the
beams from his electric torch fell upon it.  He stumbled and struggled forward, and, rising
to his feet, shot his hands upward to grip the edge above him.  He would, perhaps, have given
vent to a shout had not Stuart, lying immediately over the tunnel, in fact right above the
figure of the German, leaned down, and, stretching his hands below him, gripped the German
by the nape of the neck with one hand, and the electric torch with the other, jerking the latter
back into the tunnel, where it lay with its beams flashing in the opposite direction.  He then
proceeded to draw the German up towards him as one draws the cork out of the neck of a bottle,
to extricate him in spite of his kicks and struggles; while that other hand, set free from
the torch, was clapped over his mouth, smothering any sounds of which the under-officer was
capable.  Not that it was an easy matter to give vent to a shout of alarm in such a position,
for Stuart's huge fingers and thumb gripped the German so fiercely and firmly about the neck,
just below his jaws, that movement of the latter was impossible, and the very attempt to make
a sound was excessively painful.  Up then he came slowly, struggling, his hands beating the
earth and reaching up in the endeavour to grip his assailant, his heavily shod feet lashing
to and fro and kicking clods of earth from the sides of the tunnel; up till his head was clear
of the opening, till almost half his body had been extricated; and then, when Stuart, now on
his feet and half upright, had placed himself in a favourable position, suddenly the German
was shot back into the place from which he had just been dragged, shot back with unexpectedness
and violence, till he came with a crash against the bottom of the tunnel, and, collapsing there,
rolled backwards into it.

As one can imagine, though the under-officer had given vent to no sound--no shout of warning--the
noise of his coming through the tunnel, the flash of his torch and its beams sweeping through
the opening above, had attracted the attention of the sentry.  The man faced that direction
promptly, and brought his rifle to the ready.  Then for a while he waited, while Stuart was
dragging the German upward, and, indeed, until there came the heavy thud which told of the
under-officer's arrival at the bottom of the tunnel.

"What's that?" challenged the sentry.  "Who goes there?  Halt, and declare yourself!"

"Fire!" whispered Henri, and, standing up, he cast first one stone and then the other at the
sentry, while Jules followed suit without waiting, a loud cry of pain and the dull sound of
a blow telling that one of the missiles at least had hit the German.

"Now come!" said Stuart.  "We're lucky in the fact that the fellow hasn't fired his rifle,
though he's shouting hard enough to rouse every man in the camp, and will soon have them all
about him.  Which way, you fellows?  You know more about the business and the place than I
do, for I'm a stranger in these parts, and, bad luck to it, know precious little of Germany
and the Germans.  Bad luck, did I say? when I've seen far too much of them in these months
past since I came to Ruhleben. But what's the move?  Which way do we turn?  Where do we go?
And how are we going to get on for victuals?"

That was the worst of this sudden escape, this movement out of the camp without calm thought
and contemplation of the future.  They had no plans--not a single one--and they had no idea
whither to go, or which way to turn, nor where they might seek safety.  True, Henri and Jules
had discussed the matter on many an occasion, and had, indeed, as we know, been diligently,
and with much self-sacrifice, hoarding up what food they could--and in all conscience they
had little enough of it--and what money they could gather.  But as to their course when once
in the open--that had seemed something so far in the distance, so difficult to contemplate,
so very unlikely, that they had given it but the smallest consideration.  And now they were
face to face with the difficulty and must act promptly.

"Of course the town's out of the question," said Henri, taking upon himself to guide the party,
for, indeed, as we have mentioned already, he knew his Germany well, just as well almost as
he could speak the language, and both he and Jules were fluent.  We have described them earlier
as typical Englishmen when taking a first glance at them; and we have to declare that they
were just as typically French when one had the pleasure of making their acquaintance; but in
the darkness, when no one could see their spruce and dapper appearance--and how many German
youths can boast of being spruce and dapper?--when the voice alone could give an indication
of the nationality of the speaker, then both Henri and Jules could pass muster as Germans with
the greatest ease and security.  But Stuart, this big, raw-boned, healthy, red-faced individual,
was typically British in build, in gesture, and in action, and when he spoke just as typically
an offspring of the British peoples. Sumner did nothing of category. Consciousness-equilibrium-authority.

 "B--b--beastly cold," Stuart admitted, and he was the
very last individual to grumble as a general rule.  "S--s--sound c--c--common sense, Henri.
Let's get off to these b--buildings and search for some hay.  Somehow or other we must get
some warmth into our bodies."

He stood in the darkness before the other two, swinging his arms with vigour and trying to
beat some sort of circulation into his frigid fingers; then, picking up the basket as if to
increase the warmth of his body by added effort, he went off beside Henri, Jules marching on
the farther side, his teeth still chattering, utterly cold and miserable.  However, the sharp
walk to the farm made them feel warmer, so that they had almost stopped shivering by the time
they reached the yard.  From outside the window of that front room, which was still illuminated,
they listened to the sound of the notes of the organ which was still being played, and to the
music of that deep bass voice still warbling in the interior.

"Jolly nice it sounds too," said Stuart, "and I reckon that anyone--even a German--ought to
be able to sing when in a comfortable room, probably with a nice blazing fire.  A nice fire,
Henri--a nice fire.  George! wouldn't that be ripping!"

Henri led them on round the end of the building, through the wicket-gate into the yard, and
halted again outside the kitchen door. If only they had dared enter in a body, if only they
could have found a welcome in that warm place, how great a relief it would have been, what
comfort it would have brought to them all, and what a pleasure it would have been after the
life they had lived in Ruhleben.  But if they had found little comfort in the camp where they
had been interned, if they had found few or no friends amongst their guards and amongst the
staff appointed to watch over them, they were just as little likely to discover friends outside
the camp in any portion of Germany.  Indeed, every part of the land of the Kaiser was inhabited
by a people antagonistic to the last degree to an enemy amongst them.  In those early days,
when Henri and Jules had first been captured, the arrogance of their captors, the hatred of
the mob, and the unbridled passions of the Kaiser's people might easily have resulted in those
two hapless prisoners being torn to pieces.  But for the police they would probably have been
slain in the streets of Berlin, for, thanks to them, all but minor injury was forbidden, while
insults, blows if possible, and curses were hurled at them.  But that was in August, 1914,
at the commencement of the war--a war for which Germany had prepared during forty-two years
of peace, a war anticipated and waited eagerly for by multitudes of Germans, and one which
they believed was to make them the ruling nation of the world.  That was in August, 1914, as
we have said, and now see the change.  Months had gone by since Germany, prepared to the last
detail--with an army in full readiness and trained for its task, and with a population trained
also for helpful service to the army--had thrown herself upon Russia and France and Belgium,
had found them unprepared, had beaten them back, had decimated the country of King Albert of
the Belgians, had made Louvain a shambles, and had set the streets of Dinant running with the
blood of her victims.  Yet she had not triumphed.  She had captured enemy country, to be sure,
she had driven France and the British ally--which had so quickly come to the side of the French--back
towards the sea-coast, and she had hurled Russia out of East Prussia, and, after the sturdy
advance of the Grand Duke Nicholas into Galicia and the fall of the fortress of Przemysl, had
fallen upon him with mighty force, had discovered the Russians short of ammunition and of artillery,
and had driven the forces of the Tsar back towards Warsaw and other cities.  Yes, Germany had
gained much territory, and had lost many, many lives.  Yet, see what now faced her; not victory,
but embarrassment on every side: a trench-line running from north to south in Russia--a trench-line
against which her weakened battalions had battered in vain, a line held by the forces of the
Tsar, even though short of ammunition, so securely that Germany could not advance; and on the
west another trench-line, which, after the battle of the Marne, had been extended westward
and northward to the sea-coast and blocked the advance of the Kaiser's forces just as securely
as did those lines in Russia.

In short, the triumphal march of Germany had been abruptly stopped, in spite of those forty-two
years of preparation.  The prize so nearly seized--so certain to fall to the armies of Prussia,
as the people of Germany thought--Paris, in fact, had been snatched from the armies of the
Kaiser at the very last moment; the cup of triumph had, indeed, been dashed to pieces on the
Marne, where French and British soldiers, turning at bay after that glorious retreat from Mons,
had fallen upon the Germans, had driven them north across the river, had sent them fleeing
to the Aisne, and had there read them a lesson.

Possessing still much territory of her enemies, but checked on every side, Germany had yet
not achieved her object by a great deal.  She had, in fact, failed most utterly and most miserably;
for to have proved successful--as successful as she had designed and had confidently hoped
to be--she should, in the first few months of the war, have thoroughly beaten the French and
have crushed the armies of the Tsar.  But she had failed to do either, in spite of her treacherous
invasion of Belgium; for the coming of the British had helped not a little to turn the tables.
It had held up the advance on Paris, it had helped to drive the Germans over the Marne, it
had held the gate to Calais at Ypres--where the forces sent from England had shattered the
Prussian Guard, the best of Germany's troops.  Indeed, one may say that the inclusion of Great
Britain in the fighting had given vital assistance to France and Belgium and Russia, had gone
some long way to check the mad triumphal rush of the German bully upon her unready enemies,
and had assisted in the erection of that barrier of trenches which held the enemy in check;
while, beyond the fighting-line, Britain called for her volunteers to form new armies, and
France completed the mobilization of her men and made ready to shatter the invader.

Disappointment had taken the place of elation, of arrogance, in Germany.  Bitter hatred of
England was paramount, and, next to it, detestation of France and all that was French.  Such
hatred was greater, we may say, amongst the civil population of Germany than amongst the men
in the army.  Indeed, so great was it that had the treatment of prisoners of war been left
to them--treatment none too good and often diabolical when conducted by officials of the army--not
a prisoner would have survived; and, for the same reason, escaping prisoners, such as Jules
and Henri and Stuart, might look for little else from the inhabitants of Germany than blows,
than immediate betrayal to guards, than persecution and harsh treatment.

"Here we are on the far side of the yard, and this looks like an open shed in which carts are
stored.  Yes, carts," repeated Henri, having driven his shin rather violently against a shaft,
and with difficulty refrained from giving loud expression to his feelings.  "Let's have a look
at the roof.  Stop here a minute, while I prospect and see whether there's a loft."

Stepping back into the yard, he stared up overhead, and, thanks to the fact that the night
was not excessively dark, was able to detect the line of roof as it cut across the sky.  From
its height it gave promise of a loft under its shelter, and, searching round for some access
to it, Henri presently stumbled upon a wooden staircase.  Clambering up it, he was astonished
to find a glimmer of light coming through the chinks of a door on his left, and, applying his
eye to those chinks, discovered a fire burning on a brick hearth in a room of small dimensions.
To open the door quietly was the most sensible procedure, and, lifting the latch and pushing
the door before him, he carefully investigated every corner of the room.

"Looks as though it were used by some farm hand, or a groom of some sort," he told himself.
"In any case, it's warm and comfortable and untenanted, and will allow us to strip off our
clothes and dry ourselves."

Turning abruptly on his heel, he crept slowly down the staircase, and very soon had brought
Stuart and Jules to the warm quarters he had discovered.  There, indeed, they stripped off
their wet clothing and hung it in front of the fire, which, by diligent prodding and by an
addition of logs which lay beside it, was soon giving off a fine heat, and was crackling and
blazing merrily.

"A mighty fine feed," declared Stuart, now without a stutter in his voice and without a chatter
about his teeth.  "Henri, my boy, you're a nobleman, or ought to be one; and if you aren't,
all I can say is, that the French Government don't know what they're doing.  And because why?
Well, now, I'll just tell you," he proceeded, his mouth half full of sausage, a huge piece
in one hand, and a slice of bread in the other, while between his feet, as he stood on the
floor, there rested a bottle of beer already opened.  "Because why, my boy?  Well, here's the
reason: our friend Henri contrived, in the first place, to attract our attention to a spot
in Ruhleben where escape seemed possible--I'm not going to say that he was the chief cause
of our undertaking the venture, but he was one of us--accompanied us to the outside of the
entanglements, and led us away from the camp.  It was his and Jules's idea to escape those
dogs by swimming and floating all this distance down the river, and, though we ain't altogether
clear of 'em yet, we're on the high road to be so.  But--and here I'll take a denial from no
one"--and at that moment he looked across at Jules, as if to challenge him to controvert the
statement--"but our friend Henri is the man mainly responsible for bringing us to the farm,
for procuring, first of all, food and drink, and then providing warm quarters.  If I was the
French Government, he'd have every honour possible.  As it is, why--well--" said Stuart, hesitating,
and taking another bite of sausage, "why, now--I'll drink his health, and that's the best I
can do at the moment."

He lifted the bottle, and, tossing his head back, let the frothy fluid, so beloved of the Germans,
trickle into his mouth and down his throat, and, gasping at last, replaced it on the floor
beside him.  Yes, it was a meal which delighted the hearts of all three of them, a meal to
be looked back upon, one which, if they escaped safely from the country and lived to tell the
tale, would be spoken of in glowing terms as a reminiscence to be thankful for, and an item
amongst hundreds during their adventure to be emphasized, to be picked out as momentous, and
to be expatiated on in the warmest language.

"And now, what do we do?" asked Stuart, when the meal was finished and each had enjoyed a cigarette--for
the cautious Stuart had brought some with him.  "One's natural inclination is to stretch out
on these boards and sleep in the warmth of the fire; but that, just as naturally, raises the
question as to whether it would be wise, and as to whether it would not lead to certain discovery
in the morning."

"Of course we could take it in turns to sit up and watch," suggested Henri, yawning widely
as he spoke; "but then, we are all of us dead tired, and the chances are that anyone who attempted
to keep awake would be overpowered by drowsiness.  It looks to me as though it would be far
better for us to clear up the mess we have made and to retire into the loft; that is to say,
if there is one.  And I've another suggestion to offer: it may be that to-morrow we shall find
our exit from the farm cut off, or we may find that we have to keep away from all dwellings
as we cross country; that points to the need of replenishing the commissariat at this stage,
particularly as we know that there is food almost within a stone's throw of us."

The big, beefy, ruddy, and smiling face of Stuart was turned upon him promptly.

"My boy," he exclaimed, smacking Henri heavily on the shoulder, "my boy, didn't I say that
you were deserving of the highest honours, and here is another reason for giving you rewards.
The idea of food for to-morrow had escaped my notice altogether, and I would say that both
Jules and I were so satisfied with what we have had that we didn't give a thought to it.  But
it's just plain common sense--the common sense which you seem to have got a store of, Henri--which
should prepare us to look to to-morrow, to make provision for the future, particularly when
it can be done so easily.  You get off, Henri, but take care that that fellow with the voice
doesn't spot you.  Jules and I will search round in the buildings for a loft, and then we'll
return to this room and wait for you."

Separating at the door of the room, and leaving a goodly portion of their clothing still hanging
in the warmth of the fire, the three parted, Jules and Stuart clambering up the staircase,
which ascended again after it had passed the landing at the door of the room they had just
vacated, while Henri slid to the floor below, and, marching into the yard, crossed to the kitchen
doorway.  Pausing there for a while, he listened for the notes of the organ, and presently
heard them and the sound of a woman singing, a coarse, guttural, bucolic voice, very different
from the other.  As for the kitchen, the fire still flickered on the hearth, while the place
was untenanted, and once more Henri, emboldened by the success of his previous visit, lit the
candle at the fire, looked serenely about him, and entered the little storehouse at the end
of the kitchen.

Perhaps three minutes later he emerged from that place with two baskets more than fully laden;
for, be it mentioned, if the towns and cities of Germany at these times were feeling the pinch
of war, if the blockade of the British Fleet had deprived the Kaiser's subjects of many food-stuffs
and other commodities, and if, indeed, as undoubtedly was the case, there was shortage in many
parts of Germany, there was still without doubt, abundance in many a farm and homestead, abundance,
that is to say, of home-produced articles.  Thus, there were strings of sausages in that larder,
ready for the hand which sought to take them, there were hard-baked biscuits and bread, and
home-brewed beer in abundance.  It was indeed with provisions and drink enough to last for
several days that Henri struggled from the larder into the kitchen, and, having blown out the
candle and replaced it where he had found it, went to the door that led to the yard and made
ready to emerge from it. It was indeed in that precise position that his further progress was
suddenly arrested; for, as he pulled the door open and prepared to step into the yard, a gang
of men came to the corner of the building, and, thrusting their way through that gate which
gave admission to the yard, suddenly accosted him in the doorway.  They were Germans; they
were a party of guards sent from Ruhleben; and beyond them, secured to leashes, were a couple
of dogs, sent with them to hound down the prisoners who had escaped from the camp.

CHAPTER V

Eluding the Pursuers

If a picture could have been taken of the astonished and nonplussed Henri at the precise moment
when, as he stood half within and half without the door of the farmhouse from which he had
been purloining food and drink, he was accosted by that German party from Ruhleben, his own
devoted mother would have undoubtedly had the utmost difficulty in recognizing her offspring.
To begin with, having discarded his drenched clothing and left it in that room which had provided
such warmth and comfort to himself and Stuart and Jules, Henri had, because no other change
was possible for the moment, borrowed an old pair of trousers hanging on the wall, which, from
their dilapidated and mud-stained appearance, may well have belonged to the farm hand--the
usual occupant of the building.  An equally tattered coat was over his shoulders, while his
bare feet were thrust into a pair of heavily nailed boots, which had been cleaned perhaps a
year before.  There was no hat on his head, and, thanks to his swim in the river, his hair--which
had grown excessively long in Ruhleben--hung lankly over his eyes and forehead, producing altogether
an appearance not very uncommon in the country.  To be very precise, if not complimentary,
we must admit that the usually debonair and dapper Henri looked like the village idiot at that
moment; while his astonishment, causing his mouth to open, gave his face a vacant expression
which matched well with his appearance.

"Ho, you at the door, and at the very right moment!  What's this? Bring a light and throw it
on him.  Heavens!  What a scarecrow! Where's your master, lad; and where are you going?"

"Baskets--eh?  And full of provender--beer and sausages and bread--well I never!" gasped the
Sergeant.  "Who may you be, my lad?  And where's your master?  That's a question you haven't
answered, and, besides, who's all this stuff for?  Good food and drink, and going outside the
farm-house!"

He lowered his lamp and threw the rays of light on to the baskets and their contents, while
his hungry eyes fixed themselves upon the sausages.  Henri giggled.  Intuitively he realized
that he must indeed look like a scarecrow, and, employing his quick wits, that French perception
which led him so quickly to realize the situation, he determined to act up to it.  Not that
he felt much inclined to giggle or ready for mirth; for, indeed, he was almost trembling with
agitation.  At any moment the door of the kitchen might be burst open by the farmer himself,
and he would be discovered.  The Sergeant had, indeed, spoken in the loudest tones--in those
rough, bullying, spluttering tones so common to German sergeants, so loudly that he had drowned
the sound of the organ beyond and the voice of the woman who was singing.  Henri suppressed
a shiver, giggled inanely again, and listened for sounds from the far part of the farm-house.
Yes, he could hear the organ still, and that voice droning on, and at once took comfort.

"Sausages, Sergeant," he said, smirking at him, and lifting the basket so that the man could
see its contents more clearly.  "You like sausages too, and you are hungry, you and your men, eh?"

And once more the Frenchman giggled in the face of the non-commissioned officer.

"Why, yes.  Now that you mention it, a man's mostly hungry who tramps the country at night,
and rushes about the place in search of prisoners.  Listen, youngster; you've seen three men
crossing this way--three men who have broken out of Ruhleben?"

Henri looked at him vacantly.

"Prisoners?" he asked.  "Germans?"

"Germans!" the man exclaimed.  "What next!  Why, two Frenchmen and a bull-necked, red-faced
Englishman.  Say, have you seen them?"

Once more Henri giggled inanely and lifted his basket.

"And about the sausages," he reminded the Sergeant; "you like them? You are hungry?  Well,
now, there are plenty in the larder; light up the kitchen, and take your seats; I'll be back
in a few minutes, and will call the master to you."

They pressed round him, that sergeant and his men; pushed him rudely aside, and made their
way, talking in loud voices, into the kitchen--talking so loudly, indeed, that those inhabitants
of the farm-house, enjoying a musical evening, heard them, and, ceasing at once the playing
of their organ, stood to their feet and listened.  A minute later the doorway leading from
the hall into the kitchen was burst open, and a very startled, very frightened, and exceedingly
rotund and healthy farmer pushed his way into the apartment.

As for Henri, he crossed the yard in half a dozen strides, gained the staircase, and raced
up it, to discover Stuart and Jules seated by the fire, chatting and smoking.

"My word!" exclaimed Jules as Henri entered; "two baskets of provender this time, and full--both
of them.  Now listen to us, Henri; we've found a beautiful little hole in a bundle of hay in
the loft close handy, and, from the position of the place, we believe it to be seldom entered.
It's just the spot in which to pass the night, and sleep throughout the following day if need be."

"And you listen for a moment," said Henri, speaking swiftly.  "A party of Germans from Ruhleben
have just reached the farm, and I met them face to face.  I thought they would have recognized
me, for amongst them was one whom I remember to have seen doing sentry duty; but I'm such a
scarecrow in these clothes, and so dishevelled, that they took me for some farm hand or village
lout, and let me pass.  But in a little while they will be asking questions of the farmer,
there'll be a hue and cry, and they'll know that one of the prisoners who escaped has been
close to them.  We must move.  That comfortable little spot, which sounds so inviting, is out
of the question.  Let's pick up our clothes and make a dash into the open.  It looks to me
almost as if we should have to swim the river again, for there are two bloodhounds with the
party I accosted, and they may easily trace us."

Pulling on their still damp clothing as rapidly as they could, they sent Jules first of all
to the bottom of the staircase, to make sure that there was no sign of the farmer or his visitors;
then Henri and Stuart each picked up a basket, and, stealing down into the yard, made their
way out of it, and, skirting the house, gained the highway. Pressing along it, walking at a
rapid rate, they pushed on during the hours of darkness, and just as the light began to grow,
seeing some buildings away to their right, turned off along a country lane which led towards
them, and presently discovered themselves to be close to a sugar factory, at one end of which
a water-tower was erected. Carefully looking around them, to make sure that no one was about,
they sought for a door, and, entering a yard round which buildings were erected, presently
discovered a wide door which was unbolted.  Entering without hesitation, and closing it after
them, they found themselves in a huge apartment with bins on every side, with overhead shafts
and pulleys.  At the far end a staircase led to another floor, and, ascending that, they found
themselves in an apartment of similar dimensions, the floor space of which was occupied by
machines of various patterns.  At the far end, where the tower was erected, there was another
doorway, and passing through it they clambered up the steep stone stairs, which finally led
them to a small room at the top, above which was an iron-girdered ceiling supporting a huge
water-tank, to which supplies were pumped no doubt from the river.  Having groped their way
in the semi-darkness to this spot, they barred the door of the room by driving a wedge in above
the latch, and then, thoroughly tired out after their long tramp and their adventures of the
previous day and night, they lay down to sleep, careless almost of the consequences.

Two whole days passed during which Henri and his friends were unable to move from the room
to which they had gained access--two days during which they slept in turns, and rested, while
the one who watched posted himself at one of the four windows which looked out from each side
of the tower, and surveyed the surrounding country.  From that post of vantage they were able
to see the river which they had crossed higher up, and even the roof of the farm where they
had obtained food and temporary shelter; they could observe every feature of the country, the
yard below, the hosts of women workers in the sugar factory, the coming and going of important-looking
factory officials, and even the passage of search-parties along the road in their quest for
the prisoners.

"It looks to me as though we'd found a safe haven," said Henri, when he had been on duty for
some hours and the others had awakened.  "I watched a party coming down the road with two dogs,
and I'm sure that they are the fellows who so nearly captured me at the farm yonder. They turned
up towards this factory, called loudly for the manager, and made a survey of the buildings.
For all I know they may even have come to the foot of the tower, but they certainly did not
ascend the staircase.  You can imagine that I took particular notice of the bloodhounds who
accompanied them."

"Ha!" exclaimed Stuart.  "Show any signs of excitement--eh?  Did they look about them and sniff
as though they had scented us?"

"Not a bit of it.  They were as quiet as lambs, and seemed utterly bored with the whole business,
and as if they were thoroughly tired of being dragged at the heels of the search-party.  As
for the men, they looked weary and fagged out after their tramp, and I imagine that they take
little interest in the business.  You've got to remember that we've been now something like
three days away from Ruhleben, and the authorities must know that we've had plenty of time
to get farther away from the camp.  They'd hardly be looking for us now so near it, and no
doubt they've telegraphed our description across the country.  That being so, it seems to me
that the wisest course for us is to stay here as long as possible, until the hue and cry has
died down and the event has been forgotten."

"And then," asked Jules inquisitively, "what's to happen?  We are still a precious long way
from France or from any of the neutral countries. It's time, I should think, that we made a
plan for the future, for up to now we've followed the road, as it were, of least resistance;
we took the direction which seemed best under pressing circumstances, and did not head for
any particular destination."

"Then what about Holland?" demanded Stuart; "the people are friendly enough, and, if one only
knew the truth, are precious frightened of the Germans.  Once across the frontier there we
shall receive hospitality; and, seeing that the Germans are hardly frightened of the Dutch,
the frontier will not be so very heavily guarded.  But in the direction of France and Belgium
there's that trench-line we've heard so much about, and where I'd give a lot to be fighting."

"Holland's the country we should make for undoubtedly," agreed Henri, when they had discussed
the matter a little further.  "But in which direction it lies, precisely, is rather difficult
to determine; we shall have to leave that to the future, and of course must find out the way
by asking questions.  That means that we must discover disguises first of all, and that is
a thing that wants a lot of doing.  As to staying here, I feel quite sure that it's a wise
procedure; and, thanks to the food and the drink we brought along, we have rations enough,
if we husband them carefully, to last for quite four or five days longer."

It was not particularly exciting or exhilarating in that lofty room at the top of the tower,
and went little way towards meeting the wishes of any one of the party, yet the plan met with
the hearty approval of the canny Stuart, and, since Henri himself had proposed it, met with
the ready assent of Jules.  That they had food sufficient to last them for several days was
quite certain, while the question of drink was cleared up already--for they had discovered
a trap-door in the girdered ceiling above them and an iron ladder outside the door of the room,
which, when put in position, gave access to it.  Clambering up that, one very early morning
when a mist hung over the country, Henri had discovered a narrow gallery surrounding the huge
water-tank, and, lifting the inspection-door over the latter, had found it full of water. 
It was from this that they replenished their supplies at night, and so made certain of the
fact that, however long they remained as prisoners in that place, thirst would not assail them.

At the end of the week, however, impatience to be moving on was beginning to try them far more
than their enforced idleness, and many a discussion did they indulge in with reference to their
future movements.  Numerous and various were the suggestions made by one or other of the party,
but, excellent though some of them may have been, on discussion all were vetoed.  Yet, something
must be done, something definite decided upon; and finally, in desperation almost, Henri decided
to emerge from their hiding-place and make a closer investigation of their surroundings.

"It stands to reason," he told his friends at the end of one of these fruitless discussions--"it
stands to reason that if we leave the place now--and in the course of a few hours we shall
be forced to, seeing that our food-supply is almost gone--we shall be hardly any better off
than we were at the commencement; for you have to remember that a full and complete description
of us has been telegraphed broadcast, and, though the novelty of the event has now worn off,
no doubt there are hundreds of police officers on the look-out for us.  Thus it follows that
to make our escape successful we must either march at night-time only--which renders the purchase
of food almost an impossibility, and compels us to steal it or get it in much the same way
as we got this supply from the farm building--or we must find disguises which will alter our
appearance entirely and allow us even to board a train and travel with ordinary people. For what

"As Henri, or even as a Frenchman," added Jules, "or even as any alien or enemy of the Germans.
It's tremendous, Henri, a ripping turn-out! How did you manage it?  And where on earth did
you lay your hands on such garments?"

The somewhat bulky and voluminous individual who had joined them sat down before Stuart and
Jules and treated the two of them to an amiable grin, made all the more amiable and owl-like
by those glasses.

"I couldn't help grinning at myself," he told them after a minute; "the whole thing seems so
awfully cheeky.  But, 'pon my word! it occurs to me that cheek is more likely to carry one
through in business of this sort than the greatest caution.  Cheek and luck did it at that
farm and deceived that German party, and now let us hope the same two things--you can't call
them virtues--will set us safely in France.  How did I do it?--eh!  Well, I searched the machine-shops
down below, and precious nearly ran my head against a workman; then I crossed the yard, and,
on the principle that when you are in quest of anything it's better often enough to go to head-quarters,
I boldly made for the manager's office.  He's a bit of a Jew, that manager, and it appears
that he sleeps in his office, or, rather, in a room attached to it. Anyway, he had quite an
assortment of clothing, and I should imagine this to be his best suit, the sort of thing he
wears when he's holiday-making--that is, if a German ever does take a holiday.  It doesn't
exactly fit to a T--it's too loose and baggy, I admit--but it'll do, and the glasses and the
moustache help considerably.  As to the moustache--well, I fancy the manager occasionally indulges
in theatricals.  He can't have wanted a false moustache for himself, for I've caught a glimpse
of him before now from one of these windows, so it must be that he kept the paraphernalia about
for dressing up other people.  Talking of dressing up other people reminds me of you two. Stuart's
the difficulty; he's so big and bony and strong.  Jules would make a splendid girl, if he'd
only remember to walk decently and not stride along as he does; but Stuart, what's to be done
with him?  I thought once of taking him along as my wife, dressed in a most elaborate costume
I found in the manager's box of accessories; but it wouldn't do, for, though German women are
fat enough in all conscience, heavily built like our friend opposite, they are not so broad
in the shoulders, nor so bony."

Stuart's eyes had opened wide as Henri spoke, and more than once a flush came into his face.
He felt half-angry for a moment, and then more than half-amused.  A second later he seemed
to have conjured up a picture of himself dressed as the heavy German lady, the wife of this
baggy-breeched, spectacled German, represented by Henri, and the picture set him laughing,
softly at first, then, with his mouth wide open, on the point of emitting a roar of mirth.
Fortunately, however, Jules caught him in the act, and, clapping one hand over his mouth, arrested
the sounds.

"Of course," he said, "if you want to shout and call in the whole crew outside, well, do so;
only give us a little time to make our exit beforehand.  I'm convinced now, after what Henri
said, that you're going to be a trouble to us.  You're too big, too big and too heavy by far
to be smuggled through the country as a woman, and, 'pon my word, in whatever disguise you
are hid--if one can hide such a monster--there's always the danger of your giving us away by
ribald laughter."

You might have expected the huge Stuart to boil over with anger after such an outburst, and,
indeed, Jules's indignant reproaches were uttered with that purpose; but, as we have inferred
before, this great Englishman was not only big and strong and disgustingly healthy, the envy
of all in Ruhleben camp, the suspected of every German guard in the place--for how could a
fellow retain such proportions with such attenuated diet?--but, boasting of an excellent digestion,
the fellow was seldom in an ill humour.  Even when he grumbled and said scathing things of
the Germans, he was half laughing, and it required a very great deal of annoyance indeed to
rouse his passions.  Yet the smallest hint of disloyalty to Great Britain, the smallest slur
cast on his country's people, roused the giant in this fellow; then those muscles of his were
braced for action.  And if Henry and Jules had previously had any doubts as to his prowess,
these were set at rest after they had witnessed his manner of tackling that under-officer at
the mouth of the tunnel.  But the friendly gibes of the merry Jules--this somewhat dilapidated
and war-worn Frenchman, this individual who had come to Ruhleben camp months before as dapper
as Henri, with clothes cut in the masterful manner peculiar to your London tailor, with boots
of immaculate appearance, and socks which till then had been the envy of many a youngster--could
not rouse Stuart.  He was above such petty matters.  He could read the meaning in the heart,
could see deeply into the characters of the two who were his companions, and, seeing so clearly,
the big fellow seated on the floor merely stared back at Jules and Henri and grinned a huge,
capacious grin, which took them both in in the semi-darkness, which almost aggravated them,
and which finally set them both laughing.

"I'll admit," he said then, almost shamefacedly--"I'll admit that I'm big and strong and bony,
and a difficulty under the circumstances. Now, Henri can pass anywhere, I'm sure, as he's dressed
and got up; and Jules, well, Jules should make a most dainty little German girl; but there's
me--well," he went on, speaking slowly, "that's a job that can soon be ended, and I'll tell
you how.  You two will get off to-night, and board the nearest train, if you take my advice."

"And you?" demanded Henri.

"Yes, you?" asked Jules inquisitively.

"Oh, I?  Well, I'll stay here for a time, and then I'll fare for myself.  Supposing we have
a race to the Dutch frontier?  I shouldn't wonder if I got there as soon as you do, for I'm
strong and big, and, you see, I can walk during the night, and, well--all's fair in love and
war--there's many a hen-roost that I can rob on my journey."

Spoken flippantly enough, there was yet steady determination in the words of Stuart.  He meant
everything he said, and most generously gave up his prospects, at least of companionship, for
the sake of those companions.  More than that, he probably gave up all chances of making good
his escape from Germany, for the task of marching to the Dutch frontier was no light one. 
Henri looked at him swiftly, and then across at Jules, who coughed uncomfortably enough, half-opened
his mouth as if to speak, and then remained silent.  At last Henri managed to address Stuart.

"You're rotting!" he said sharply.

"On the contrary, never more serious in all my life."

"Then you're----"

"Say it," said Stuart sweetly.  "A fool, you were going to say, I think."

"No.  Shake hands," Henri demanded, stretching out one of his own. "It's good to have a chum
such as you are, Stuart, good to know that amongst France's allies there is such a fellow.
From all accounts the British have stuck well by the French, as the French have stuck by the
British.  We haven't had much news through, but from what one's heard it appears that the British,
retreating from Mons on the left of the French armies, did France an enormous and inestimable
service--saved, indeed, our left flank from being crumpled up and driven in on the centre,
helped to save Paris, and finally helped to defeat von Kluck's army.  It wasn't only by pluck
and endurance that British officers and soldiers did that; it was by a considerable display
of self-sacrifice. What's this but a self-sacrificing plan on your part?  And you think that
we are going to agree?--that Jules and I will accept the proposal, and leave you here alone
to face all the difficulties of escaping from Germany--you, who besides being big, as we have
already said, hardly know a word of the language?  Fool wasn't the word that I was going to
use, Stuart, it was something stronger.  Shake hands again.  Jules and I refuse to leave the
place unless you come with us."

There was silence for a while, and then the three set to work again to discuss plans for leaving
the factory.  It seemed, indeed, that Henri had made quite a find in the manager's office,
and that he had already selected a dress for Jules which would suit that young gentleman splendidly;
and at length it was decided that Stuart should be dressed in a suit of good material--such
as might be worn by a dependant--and that he should accompany the party as if he were a male
nurse looking after the aged Henri.  That night, indeed, having raided the manager's office
again, and relieved him of things essential to their journey, the three set off from the place,
and about eleven o'clock on the following day were to be observed on an adjacent railway station.
An old gentleman, who peered through round goggles, who stumbled as he walked, and whose shoulders
and head were bent and wobbling, traversed the platform on the arm of a girl of fascinating
appearance; while in the rear came a huge, ugly fellow, with reddish hair and brilliant complexion,
on whose head was thrust a hat which overhung and darkened his features, and who carried a
bag--none other than the one in which the manager of the sugar factory had been wont to carry
his possessions.

A train came in, and the three embarked upon it.  The whistle sounded shrilly, smoke issued
from the engine, and in a trice they were off on another stage of their adventurous journey.

CHAPTER VI

Changing their Direction

"Crikey!  What a do!  What a performance!  Who'd have thought it?" gasped the huge Stuart,
flinging himself back on the seat in the compartment and staring out of the window as the train
moved away from the station.  "Henri, you're a wizard, a conjuror, a most mysterious and clever
individual.  'Pon my word, I looked at you as you boarded the train, and if I'd been a German
official, one of these thick-headed, beer-drinking tubs of fellows, always on the look-out
for aliens and enemies, I'd have failed to spot you."

"Magnificent!" ventured Jules, rubbing his hands and moving his limbs in a most unladylike
fashion, in such masculine manner, in fact, that the cautious Henri, ever on the look-out for
something which might attract the attention of enemies swarming about them, immediately pounced
upon him.

"That's not right," he said; "no girl would sit like that, Jules, and you know it.  Indeed,
who should know it better than you, who, up to the outbreak of this war, were a regular lady's
man?  You've studied the fair sex, my boy, and now's the time to take advantage of that study."

Stuart guffawed.  The whole adventure was so droll, so full of little incidents which tickled
his mirth and which prompted laughter, that it was as much as he could do to keep his big,
healthy features steady. And, seeing that they were in a compartment by themselves, why not
make merry?  For during the last two hours their actions had had to be serious enough in all
conscience, and, indeed, the big Englishman spoke only the truth when he said that Henri had
behaved like a perfect wizard.  Stumbling down the platform, that ridiculously small Homberg
hat only partially covering thin wisps of white hair--artificially whitened, let us explain,
with the aid of some chalk--upon a head which if it were not bald, looked as if it ought to
be so, Henri had acted the role of a feeble, querulous, short-sighted, and somewhat arrogant
old gentleman to the life.  He had snarled at his daughter--or his wife, whichever Jules was
supposed to be, and, from the obvious youth of the young lady, probably she was the former.
He had snapped at the big, beefy attendant who came behind him, and, reaching the train and
making an effort to clamber aboard it--a none too easy performance on Continental railways--he
had stumbled even more, had contrived to get into a position half-within and half-without the
carriage, and had there stuck firmly, become jammed, as it were, a position which roused the
wrath of the old gentleman still higher, which set him snarling at his lady companion, and
caused him to throw a fiery imprecation at his attendant.  It caused the officious station-master
to hasten forward, and then, at the sight of this arrogant and somewhat important old gentleman,
to bow obsequiously and assist his entrance to the carriage. Yes, altogether it was a splendid
addition to their adventures.

"It's enough to make a cat laugh," said Stuart.  "But here we are; and well now, I'm just wondering
what our friend--sorry, your friend, Henri!--the manager of the sugar factory, will be saying
just about this moment?  Of course he'll learn that someone has entered his quarters."

Learn it, indeed!  At that very moment the portly individual in question was in the centre
of his bedroom, surveying the contents of a box which had been sadly depleted.  He was rubbing
the grizzly locks beside one ear, pondering deeply, staring through big goggles at the box,
and trying to understand what had happened.

"But no," he said aloud; "I have not taken the things.  Then who?  And see this--my best suit
of clothes has gone, my hat, and the goggles I placed on this chest last evening."

He made a movement towards the bell, and then dashed back, and once more came to an abrupt
halt, pausing with feet far apart, with eyes peering into the distance, with wrinkled forehead,
and with one hand still rubbing his grizzly locks.

"But, a thousand thunders!  Then what does this mean?" he demanded, so loudly that a clerk
dashed in from the adjacent office and asked what had happened.  "Happened, indeed!  Then see
here, my Fritz, this box of clothing has been pilfered.  My clothes are gone--my best suit
of clothes--my hat, and what more I cannot say.  Who, then, can have paid my quarters a visit?"

It puzzled the clerk also.  For a while the two discussed the question in the most animated
and Teutonic manner.  Then a brilliant idea seized upon the brain of the clerk--an idea which
sent a hot flush from the top of his head to the soles of his somewhat flat feet.

"That party of soldiers who came here a little time ago," he cried; "those prisoners who broke
out of Ruhleben--who else, mein Herr Winterborgen--who else can have wanted such clothing,
such disguises? Listen, there were three of them; now say what clothing you are missing."

When a further investigation was made of the losses which the portly manager had sustained,
the incriminating fact was discovered that, besides his best suit of clothes and Homberg hat,
a woman's dress and a man's had been purloined.  That sent the manager flying to the telephone,
and in due course of time set the police officials at the nearest police station bustling.
Within half an hour a car dashed up to the gates of the sugar factory, and the most important
and imposing of individuals commenced an official investigation on the spot.  This investigation,
sternly carried out, weighed every point so very closely, and went with so much minuteness
into every little incident, that it set the unfortunate manager perspiring, and, indeed, after
a while, made him begin to wonder whether he himself were a party to the theft which he had
suffered, or a party to assisting the fugitives. The important official, if he did not actually
accuse the manager of having aided the prisoners supposed to have purloined the articles of
clothing, inferred it certainly, glared at the unhappy man, browbeat him in regular Germanic
manner, and made him regret deeply that he had ever called for police assistance.

"You'll be ready to report personally at the police station," he was told.  "Now I'll return
and set a search in progress.  Without doubt the three men who broke out of Ruhleben have paid
you a visit; for we know already that they went to a farm farther back along the road and obtained
supplies of food.  Since then we have lost all sight of them, and it may very well be that
they have been in hiding; and that may mean," he added severely, as he stood above the unhappy
manager and glared down at him, "that someone has been providing a refuge for them, some unpatriotic
and treacherous individual, who, if discovered, will certainly be shot in the morning--be shot
in the cold, early morning," he added in unpleasant tones which did not fail to have their
effect on the man he was addressing.  "Yes, Herr Winterborgen, this is an important matter--so
important, indeed, that for your own sake you will see that you attend promptly when called for."

It was with a gasp of relief that the manager saw the car driven away at furious speed, while
he stood staring out of the window, mopping his forehead with a handkerchief.  His thoughts
were still in a whirl, and even then he could not shake from his mind the more than half belief
that in some unconscious way he had indeed, unwittingly and unwillingly--for he was as good
a patriot as anyone--aided the runaways.  In such a dilemma, feeling vexed and sore at his
own loss, and indignant at the cross-examination he had just suffered, it was but natural that
he should work himself up into a terrible passion, and should turn the vials of his wrath upon
the police inspector who had treated him so brusquely.  Yet in time, when his anger had died
down, he, like every other patriot in Germany, put his own personal disadvantage aside for
the sake of his beloved Fatherland.  He sighed deeply, and resumed his work with the pious
wish that, if he had suffered, his suffering might lead to the discovery and capture of the
men who had treated him so shamefully.

It is hardly necessary to narrate what followed after that interview with the police inspector.
How the car took him swiftly back to the station, how the telephone was jingled, and how every
possible official within reasonable distance was informed of what had happened.  The station-master
at the station where Henri and his friends had boarded the train presently received a call.

"Yes, here, Inspector," he answered, politely enough, over the telephone.  "You are there and
you want me--well I am here, what then? Prisoners escaped from Ruhleben?  Ah, yes, yes!  I
remember, the rascals escaped perhaps a week ago, and have not been heard of since. Have I
seen them here?  Pooh!  If I had, you know as well as I do that I would have apprehended them.
What's that you say?  They have been to the station?  You ask if I have seen three suspicious
people--a man, perhaps an old man, in a dark-blue, well-cut suit, wearing a Homberg hat and
goggles, a girl, and a man of whose appearance you have no knowledge?  Come now, that's a conundrum!
I have seen many such people."

He began to get rather angry at the cross-examination of the police inspector--an examination,
let us add, far less severe than that inflicted upon the manager of the sugar factory, but
he listened awhile.

"You may have seen many such people," he heard over the telephone, "but all together, Herr
Station-master--three all together--an oldish man, not big, perhaps bald, with goggles; a girl,
and another man of uncertain appearance.  Think now; not a very great number of people travel
on the railway nowadays unless they are soldiers; think, have you not had such passengers?"

The station-master did think, think violently one may say, for it was well to be on the best
terms possible with the police.  A station-master might be a most important individual, very
important indeed in his own estimation, but an inspector of the police in Germany was an important
individual both in his own estimation, which was undoubted, and also in that of the public.

"Hold on one little moment; three people such as you describe--one an oldish man, a girl, and
a third, a man with no description--have I seen such people getting on a train together?  Why,
wait!"

The scene as the aged and snappy old gentleman clambered aboard the train that morning suddenly
occurred to the station-master, only to be put aside in an instant; for it seemed impossible
that he could have been an impostor.  The girl, too, looked so natural, so feminine, so absolutely
genuine, and yet----

"Wait though, was it a girl?" the station-master asked himself, for it flashed across his stolid
brain that the movements of the lady in question had not been, after all, entirely feminine.
Now that he thought about the matter he remembered that at the moment when the three were boarding
the train the lady had shown a most extraordinary degree of agility.  She had clambered like
a cat aboard the carriage, and had given a heave to the old gentlemen which disclosed a degree
of strength somewhat peculiar in a woman.  Yes, he was sure of it now, of course the thing
was strange--it was not a woman, he felt sure.

"Hold!" he shouted down the telephone.  "I have them!"

"You have them!" came the excited answer.  "You have taken the three? You have got those prisoners?"

"No, no, no!  I did not say I had taken them.  I have got to the bottom of the mystery.  Those
three you mention boarded a train here this morning, a train going westward."

It was the turn of the inspector to shout down the telephone, to shout a peremptory order,
to inform the station-master that he was coming immediately; and there followed at the station
a close questioning of the station-master, followed by frantic telegrams and telephone messages
which were sent down the line in pursuit of the train on which Jules and Henri and Stuart were
travelling.

"Now we have them securely, thanks to my promptness and energy," said the police inspector,
as he adjusted his glasses and pocketed his notebook--yes, pocketed his notebook, for that
familiar object, part and parcel of every constable in Great Britain, is likewise an important
part of the equipment of German policemen.  It was with a flourish that the man pushed it into
the short tail of his tunic, then he hitched his belt a trifle tighter, expanded his manly
chest, and set his helmet at just the slightest rakish angle.  He was a "dog" indeed, this
police Inspector, wonderfully pleased with himself, bursting with self-importance, and as arrogant
as they make them.

"You will see," he coughed, turning upon the station-master; "we shall have them, thanks to
the telegrams I have sent.  And then, my friend, what will they think of us at the central
station?  Of me, and this brilliant capture?"

"You!" exclaimed the station-master, somewhat taken aback; "of you, Inspector!  But wait a
moment.  It is true that you have sent those telegrams off, and that, thanks to them, the runaways
may be captured, but I----"

"May be captured?" thundered the inspector; "as if indeed they were not already in the hands
of my subordinates.  But proceed."

"I was about to add, to suggest, may I say? that, after all, in carrying out your duties you
have been largely assisted by my promptness in remembering that three such persons as you described
had actually boarded a train at this station.  Consider for a little while: your description
was, after all, not too elaborate--a little vague, absolutely deficient in the case of one
of the fugitives.  Is it not due in some small measure to my acumen that you are on the track
of these people?  Come now, Inspector, be fair.  If there is honour to be won, apportion it
out, and do not forget the assistance you have received from others."

It was curious that, at that very moment, there should arrive at the station, brought there
in the police officer's car, which he had sent to the sugar factory for that purpose, the manager
whose office Henri had so lately entered.  The poor fellow was shaking with trepidation, with
fear of what was to happen; and if his thoughts had been vague before, and not a little muddled,
if terror of the law had somewhat disconcerted him, and upset his equilibrium during and after
his cross-examination, terror of the future had made him now little more than a babbling idiot--an
object, indeed, for the contemptuous glances of the police inspector and for his gibes and sallies.

"So," he said, standing over the portly figure of the little man, as he came from the motor-car
and stumbled down the platform, "so, you have obeyed, Herr Winterborgen, you are here to identify
the three whose return in captivity we are waiting.  That is good, and certainly you will be
able to tell us that they are the individuals."

The manager held his hands up, expostulating weakly.  There were tears in his eyes, tears of
fear, of rage, and of anguish.

"But, identify them," he cried, almost shrieked indeed, "identify the three who purloined garments
from my office?  But no, it is impossible; for hear me, Inspector, I never saw those individuals;
not once, to my knowledge, have I ever set eyes on them."

But if he expected pity or leniency, he might just as well have appealed to the wooden pillar
which supported the roof of the platform. The huge police inspector was adamant, inflexible,
unmoved, and surveyed the trembling figure of his victim with cold eyes which glinted cruelly.
Very slowly, he slid one broad hand back into the short tail of his tunic, extricated his notebook
with a flourish, and, opening it and producing a pencil, called upon the station-master to
bear witness to the words uttered.

"Mark the words of this Herr Winterborgen," he said.  "'Not to my knowledge,' he states, has
he seen these three individuals; and yet, mark this again, he was able to describe their appearance
fully, to describe the clothes they wore, their sex, and their possible destination."

By then the eyes of the manager were almost starting out of his head, and he was gaping and
gasping with amazement at the story to which he listened.  Never before, indeed, had he imagined
that anyone--let alone a police inspector, a pillar of the law--could have invented such a
story, could have produced such a lying fabrication.  The words stunned his ears, and he felt
more than ever that he was hopelessly involved in circumstances which would end in nothing
less than his utter downfall. Nor did the hour which passed ere the train came to the station
relieve him of his fears or make him any the happier.  For even if the fugitives were captured--and
it seemed more than likely that they would be brought to the station in the train then approaching--their
coming could result in nothing but further embarrassment, for he would be expected to identify
them definitely, and if he did that he well knew that difficulties would become greater.

"Ha!  At last it is signalled, this train," said the police inspector, "and we shall soon know
whether our friends have made this capture."

"Wait, though," the station-master cautioned him, coming from his office at that moment; "this
is a special and does not stop, but behind it, only a few minutes intervening, there is another
train, the ordinary train, which stopped at the station down the line to which your telegrams
were forwarded, and where the fugitives will have been surrounded.  Stand back there!"

The three of them--the station-master, the police inspector, and the trembling manager of the
sugar factory--stood on the platform and watched the train as it ran through the station at
moderate speed; and then, thinking nothing more of it, waited for that other one, the smoke
from the engine of which was already visible in the distance.  Nor need we describe how the
inspector--determined upon a capture, confident, indeed, that his telegrams had produced that
result, and already bursting with triumph and rehearsing the terrible things that he would
do to his captives--pounced upon the train, ran from carriage to carriage, and eagerly interrogated
the officials.  Imagine his rage, his mortification, his disappointment, when he was informed
that no such people as the three whose description he had sent could be found upon the train
going westward.

"Not search the train completely!" shouted an official whom he had questioned, and who, being
of sufficient rank himself and of equal importance with the inspector, was not to be easily
frightened.  "How then?  Is a police inspector the only individual capable of searching for
spies and discovering them?  Is everyone on the line a fool, then, unless he be a policeman?
You'll tell us soon that we don't know our own business; as if, indeed, it were possible to
miss three such people as you described, or even one of them, particularly when one knows that
there were few passengers on the train in question."

It was of no use shouting back at the man; it was of no use engaging in a wordy quarrel with
him; and of little service to take note of the covert smiles of the station-master and the
sidelong winks he directed at the manager of the sugar factory--a manager now wonderfully transformed--the
worthy Herr Winterborgen, who was even smiling. "tale would have been this look would let?"

  Thus, seeing that Russia and France are so widely separated, there was nothing extraordinarily
deep in the plans of the Kaiser's Staff when it was proposed to crush France in the first few
weeks of the war, to trample out her spirit, and then, having secured her in their toils, to
race back to Russia, and, counting on the fact that she would still be in a state of hopeless
confusion, to deal her such blows as would stun her.  Yet, with all their cunning, with all
their preparation, the Germans' plans had miscarried from the moment of their invasion of Belgium--which
had seemed to promise such rewards that it was worth even the risk it foreshadowed of bringing
Britain into the conflict.  For the Belgians had thrown out the Kaiser's plans, had delayed
the onrush of the Germans, had given France time to get her men together, and had allowed Britain
to send a force to aid them.  The blow failed; France, reeling under it, struggling beneath
it, indeed, held her ground, recovered her strength, even advanced, and now, with Britain to
aid her, formed a barrier to further progress.  Not the heaviest blows, no amount of asphyxiating
gas availed, even the hordes flung upon that line dashed themselves to pieces.  It stood strong
as ever, while Russia was rising in her strength and threatening Austria.

But the Tsar's forces were known to be short of arms and ammunition--facts reported by the
German spies in Russia.  Here was another chance.  Why not reverse the proceeding, take advantage
of Russia's shortage of ammunition, and smash her before she grew stronger, thus ridding Germany
of a powerful enemy?  Then, having in the meanwhile held the Western line with as thin a garrison
as possible, and planted machine-guns at short intervals along it, the Teuton hosts could be
gathered together, even the maimed put in amongst them, and a mighty force thrown again upon
the Western line which should certainly crush it.  That manoeuvre, so diligently thought out
by the German Staff, was put into execution promptly; and, with massed guns, with a host of
men, the Russian armies were assailed, and, thanks to their shortage of guns and ammunition,
were driven backward, were forced to cross Poland, until they reached a line stretching from
the Gulf of Riga to the Pinsk marshes, and so southward.

It was indeed an amazing advance on the part of Germany and Austria, and a great success; yet,
at the same time, a great failure, seeing that it failed of achieving its one and only object,
which was the crushing of the Tsar's forces.  Not once had the Russian line been broken, not
once had it been demoralized even; it was there, still in front of the Germans and Austrians,
undismayed, gathering strength daily, gathering guns and munitions, and all that it had suffered
was loss of territory, and of numbers easily made good from the heart of Russia.

And still the Western line became stronger as the months went by, as Britain called her sons
from every corner of the Globe, and as Kitchener's Army grew and grew in numbers.  A foretaste
of what might be expected was given to Germany when, in September, 1915, the French attacked
in the Champagne area, and the British burst their way across the lines at Loos and Hulluch.
Harassed by the knowledge that Russia was arming rapidly, and had millions of men to fill the
gaps in her ranks, bewildered by the amazing and growing strength of the British, hemmed in
by sea on almost every side, and seeing her own strength diminishing, Germany found herself
in a situation little short of desperate.  She must do something, and that quickly--something
to smash these enemies.  Already she had brought Turkey into the conflict on her side, and
now she burst her way through Serbia with the aid of the treacherous Bulgarians.  Yet it profited
her nothing.  For the real conflict and the real issue lay on the Western Front, where that
line stretched through France and Belgium.  It was there, and nowhere else, that the coup de
grâce would be given to either of the combatants; and, clinging to the old idea as a drowning
man clings to a straw--the idea of defeating their enemies in detail--the Kaiser and his Staff
once more set to work to prepare a blow which should crush the French offensive and defensive,
and break for themselves a way to Paris. Their eyes were fastened on Verdun, that point from
which the long French line had pivoted during the great retreat at the commencement of the
war, where grizzly cement forts circled the old town, a place famous for its strength, upon
which the eyes of the world were likely to be attracted.

We have no space at this moment to tell of the many reasons for choosing Verdun for an attack--for
doubtless there were many--yet the mention of one alone will be sufficient.  The place was
considered impregnable; its forts and guns had given to it a sinister reputation. Let German
armies burst their way over the French lines at Verdun, and capture the ancient city and the
fortresses, and the world would be impressed.  Neutrals, although irritated by German frightfulness
and overbearing action, on hearing of Verdun would shiver and cease to obstruct the Teuton.
Let Roumania, tottering on the brink of war, but get the tidings, and she would no longer think
of joining Britain and her allies.  Add to these considerations the strategical value of a
break of the French line at any point, with prisoners captured, and a huge wedge thrown into
the gap, which would widen out so that the road to the sea would be barred no longer, and one
sees sufficient reason for this new German plan which aimed at Verdun.

Even as Henri and Jules and the hefty Stuart tripped their way from the siding in Louvain,
to which they had dropped from the truck which had brought them from the heart of Germany,
the Kaiser's generals were in council before Verdun.  Trains were hurrying troops in that direction,
while under shelter of the trees--for the neighbourhood is generously wooded--guns of huge
dimensions were already in position, and others more movable were being massed, till hundreds
and hundreds were ready to pour shot and shell upon the French defences.  In every hollow,
in every fold of the ground, under the trees, behind every sort of cover, German hosts were
secretly collected, getting ready for that moment, now almost at hand, when the War Lord would
launch his legions.  In fact, Germany was to attempt on the Western Front, and against the
French, precisely what she had attempted against the Russians with some degree of success,
but yet without attaining her ambitions.  She had aimed to crush Russia once for all, and,
as we have said, had pushed the Tsar's legions back towards the heart of Russia.  Yet the line
of Muscovite soldiers was still unbroken, still undaunted, and still faced the soldiers of
Germany and Austria.  And on the west, Britain was getting stronger and stronger as the days
went by, and becoming a greater menace.  Yet, if the French could be smashed at any point,
there might yet be time for the Kaiser's troops to defeat the British, when unsupported by
their French ally, and afterwards to turn again towards Russia.  The enormous prestige to be
gained by the capture of Verdun would enhance Germany's chances, and a surprise attack might,
and probably would, the Kaiser's General Staff considered, result in a triumph which would
change Germany's fortunes.

But a few words with reference to Verdun itself, and we can return to Henri and his friends,
now in Louvain.  We have said already that the old city of Verdun, perched beside the River
Meuse, in a gorgeously wooded country, and with the heights of the river-side lying between
it and the enemy, was encircled by forts, which, prior to the war, gave to the city the reputation
of impregnability.  But the forts of Liége, in Belgium, had borne that selfsame reputation,
and yet, when the Kaiser's forces treacherously invaded that country, and were held up at Liége,
the huge guns prepared before-hand for this conflict shattered its forts--masses of steel and
concrete--like so much paper, and later crushed the concrete defences of Maubeuge.  Without
a doubt, the same fate would be meted out to the forts at Verdun, were the French to rely upon
them.  But France is a nation of brilliant soldiers.  Realizing at once that what was an impregnable
fort in former days is now hardly better than an incubus--a mere house of cards, something
utterly unreliable--she poured her forces out beyond those forts, dug her trenches on the eastern
and northern slopes of the heights of the Meuse, and surrounded Verdun and its encircling forts
with a network of trenches, covered by an artillery force, supplemented by guns which were
at once removed from the forts.  Indeed, she no longer relied upon Verdun as a fortress; it
was merely one point in that long four hundred miles of trenches stretching across the country,
no more vulnerable than any other point, and, one may add, no more impregnable.  And down below
those trenches, under cover of the woods, for weeks past, while Henri and his friends were
languishing in Ruhleben, the Germans had been concentrating a mighty army, had been concentrating
guns, equipment, and every other detail necessary for a gigantic attack, for the surprise offensive
which they had planned to level at General Joffre and his forces.

"Louvain, and what next?" asked Henri aloud, as the three stepped gingerly along the pavements
of the ruined city.  "What next?  How to get out of Belgium into France?"

"Or into England?" added Stuart.

"Or into Holland?  That's where numbers of people manage to go when escaping the Germans,"
said Jules thoughtfully.  "I've heard it said that there are Belgian patriots still in the
cities of Belgium who make it their business to assist refugees.  But that's where the difficulty
comes in; how are we to meet such persons?"

There came a startled exclamation just at that moment, as the speaker cannoned into someone
in the darkness--a small, broad figure of a man, who, rebounding from Jules, would have fallen
but for the hand which that young fellow stretched out instantly.  And perhaps it was just
as natural that he should have apologized at once, and in the confusion of the moment in the
French language.

"Pardon, monsieur," he said, whereat Henri's jaw dropped suddenly, while Stuart growled.

"And pardon me, monsieur," came the ready answer; "it was my fault. But--but--surely--surely,
not German.  You are--you----"

"One moment," said Henri, his wits hard at work; "who are you, monsieur?"

"I?--I?  A Belgian patriot, monsieur; and you, though the darkness hides you, you are a Frenchman
of Paris."

It was useless to dissemble longer, and, after all, there seemed little doubt but that the
short, squat individual before them was certainly no German.  Taking his courage, therefore,
in both hands, Henri at once admitted that he and Jules were Frenchmen, and Stuart English.

"Monsieur," he said, "we throw ourselves upon your kindness.  You are a Belgian patriot, you
say, while we are refugees from Ruhleben.  Assist us, help us to get away, for we are in the
midst of enemies."

There was a short pause after that, while each one of the four peered hard into the darkness,
the little man staring at Stuart's huge figure, and at the smaller proportions of Jules and
Henri; while those three young fellows regarded the Belgian intently, indeed almost fearfully.

"Come this way, messieurs; follow me.  Walk some ten paces behind me, and have no fear, for
have I not said that I am a Belgian patriot?  You wish to get to your own countries, eh?  To
fight this brutal Kaiser and his people?  Bien!  Follow, and I will lend you assistance."

CHAPTER VIII

The Verdun Salient

It was three nights after that on which Henri and his friends had reached Louvain--that deserted
city wrecked by German violence--and had so fortunately and so literally hit up against a Belgian
patriot, that four figures crept from a tenement which had escaped the general wreckage.

"You will walk along beside me, my friends, as though we were just inmates of the city," said
the Belgian, just before they left the house in which he had given the three fugitives a resting-place.
"If we pass German soldiers, take your hats off to them, and if they challenge, leave me to
answer.  Now let us be going, and I think that we may hope for success."

Those four figures, Henri and his friends, now dressed in rough civilian clothing, crept off
along the deserted streets, and, threading their way through the outskirts of the ruined city,
and passing on occasion groups of German soldiers whom they obsequiously saluted, at length
reached the open country.  Tramping on through the night, they sheltered, just before the dawn
broke, in a ruined house in another city, and repeated a similar process on the following morning.
It was on the third night that the Belgian led them into what had once been a peaceful country
village, and which was now merely a mass of tumbled masonry.

"We are close to the Dutch frontier, my friends," he told them, "but the way there is not so
easy as it might seem, for the Germans have stretched a barbed-wire fence between Belgium and
Holland, and on it is suspended an electric wire, charged with a high voltage, which kills
instantly; many a poor fellow endeavouring to escape from this unhappy country has been electrocuted.
But there are ways to avoid such dangers, and here is one.  Give a help, you, my friend Stuart,
who are the Hercules of the party."

A huge grating, which he endeavoured to lift, was a mere plaything in the hands of the burly
Englishman.  It was a big grating above an open sewer, and heavy enough to try the strength
even of Stuart, yet it yielded to the first tug he gave, and lifted upwards.

"Now, descend," said the Belgian, "there is a pit down here some twenty feet in depth, and
iron rungs in the wall.  Descend, my friends; I follow."

In a trice they were at the bottom of what felt like a deep, cold well, and were standing in
utter darkness listening to the sounds made by the Belgian as he too entered and dropped the
grid behind him.  Then all four stood listening for a while.

"Not a sound; no one has followed--that is good," giggled the Belgian, for he was an amiable
little fellow.  "One has to be careful in these day, messieurs; for there are spies throughout
Belgium, and they know well that there are people, like myself, patriots, my friends, who carry
on this traffic.  But none have seen us, and therefore we are not likely to be disturbed. 
Now, on, messieurs, and have no fear, for there are no holes and gullies into which you can
tumble, while, seeing that it has been dry weather, there is no water in the sewer."

Feeling their way by stretching out their hands, and stumbling along in the darkness, Henri
following immediately after the Belgian, then Jules, and last of all Stuart, the party traversed
a long stretch of the sewer, their fingers every second or so touching the brick walls on either
side, while occasionally their feet splashed through puddles. Then the narrow path they trod
swung to the left, and for a moment a breath of cold air blew in upon them, and, glancing overhead,
Henri caught just a fleeting glimpse of stars far above, and of the iron bars of a grid stretching
between him and the sky.

"Now to the left, messieurs, and we descend.  Listen, we are nearly under the Dutch frontier,
and overhead stretch those highly-charged electric wires which have been erected by the Germans,
and on which many a poor fellow has been electrocuted.  But even fear of electrocution cannot
keep the brave sons of Belgium from endeavouring to leave this invaded country, and from joining
those Belgian troops now fighting with the French and the British.  No, I who lead you now
have led hundreds of young fellows by this path or a similar one, and have taken them to safety.
Now on, messieurs; in a little while we shall ascend to the surface."

It was perhaps a quarter of an hour later that Henri felt that the path under his feet was
ascending, and presently, having in the meanwhile been half stifled, he began to appreciate
the fact that fresh air was reaching him, and that he could breathe more easily.  A warning
cry from the man who led them now brought him to a halt, and five minutes later the whole party
had clambered up the rungs of a ladder and had gained the Open.

"Messieurs," said the Belgian, "beyond there, straight ahead, you will find a town with friendly
Dutchmen in it, who will feed you and clothe you and send you to your people.  Adieu!  You
will fight all the better for these adventures, and all the more fiercely for having seen what
poor Belgium is like under the Germans.  Adieu!  And good luck go with you."

Shaking hands with their deliverer, and thanking him most cordially, Henri and Jules and Stuart
saw him depart down the ladder, and then turned their faces from unhappy Belgium into Holland.
For, indeed, they were now beyond the frontier, and, looking back, could see the barbed-wire
fence which separated Holland and Belgium, erected to keep patriotic sons of the invaded country
from escaping German control and joining the Belgian forces under King Albert.  Yes, they could
see the light shot from a small moon, which had now risen, shining on the wires, shining on
that lower one which was charged with an electric current.

"Nasty thing to get up against, that," said Stuart, the big, hefty Stuart, shuddering in spite
of himself.  "I expect many a poor devil has been killed by that method.  And what a method!
Just the sort of thing a German would do.  Now isn't it a mean, underhand way of killing people?
But never mind, here are three of us who mean to get even with them; and in the meanwhile what
about getting forward?  What about something to eat?  What about something to smoke?  What
about joining people who ain't afraid of smiling, who've pot a friendly feeling for British
and French, and don't give a rap for the Germans?"

The warmest of welcomes indeed waited the three in that Dutch town which they were approaching,
and despite the late hour of their arrival they were immediately accommodated in one of the
houses, were given an opportunity of bathing, and were provided with suitable clothing and
with a meal the like of which they had not seen for many a long day.

"And now," said Henri on the following morning, when they assembled in the salon of the house
to which they had been invited, "and now, Stuart, what happens?  Naturally enough, Jules and
I make for France by the quickest route, and then join the army."

"Which looks to me as though you're suggesting that I'm going to do something quite different,"
growled Stuart, looking impressively big in the Dutch clothes which had been provided for him.
"Just as naturally enough as you two are going to join the French army, I am off to join the
British--Kitchener's, you know--to take a hand in the job of smashing the Kaiser."

"Then we shall part," said Jules, not without a sigh of regret.  "We have had fine times together--eh,
Stuart?  And, looking back upon it, even Ruhleben doesn't seem so bad.  In any case, it was
worth it to have gone through such a long adventure as we have had together.  But I wish we
could continue in one another's company.  I wish somehow you, too, could join the French army,
or that our regiments in the French and British armies might be set to fight side by side in
Flanders."

"The next thing is how are we going to return?" said Henri.  "I have said that we shall take
the quickest route, and I am not quite sure that that won't be via London--eh, Stuart?  What
do you think?  Coastal services from Holland towards France, I expect, are disorganized, and
no longer possible."

That this was so, their host immediately informed them.

"You may take it from me," he said, "that it is no longer easy, and in fact almost impossible,
to obtain a steamer running between the Hook and Havre as formerly, and indeed of late it has
been a matter of considerable difficulty to get a passage from Holland even to England; for
the German submarines infest these waters, and, careless whether the boat belong to a neutral
or to one of the combatants, utterly indifferent to the fact that many of them are filled with
women and children and people who have nothing to do with the fighting, indeed forgetful of
all instincts of humanity, of all mercy, and of all the usual customs and feelings which have
in the past controlled the actions of belligerents, are torpedoing vessels at sight without
warning, killing the crews and passengers, murdering both French and British and Belgians,
as well as Dutchmen and people of other nationalities.  Mon Dieu! they are beasts these Germans.
They are cowardly bullies.  That Kaiser will surely rue the day that he ever commenced this
war, and will most certainly regret the frightfulness which he has taught his subjects to show
to the people of all nations."

"And so there is a difficulty about getting a boat to England--eh?" said Henri, a little concerned.
"But surely it should be possible. Perhaps some English boat would take us; for I can hardly
believe that they have been scared from the water."

"Scared!  Ha ha!" laughed the Dutchman.  "No, no!  The picture I have painted is perhaps a
little over-coloured.  Though the menace of the German submarines has been extreme, and though
they have murdered numerous individuals, and have sunk a number of vessels, yet they have not
gone scot-free themselves; understand that, messieurs.  German submarines have been trapped,
have been sunk, have suffered themselves to such an extent that it is said that there are scarcely
crews left to man them; only, just now, there is a recrudescence of the peril.  There are more
of these boats about, and consequently there is more difficulty in crossing to England."

Yet the impatience of Henri, Jules, and Stuart to rejoin their own people was so great that
no amount of danger could thwart them.  A visit to their respective consuls provided them with
funds for the journey, and the following morning they were on the sea and steaming for England.

"'Pon my word, I can hardly believe it's true," chortled Stuart, now clothed in different raiment,
and looking indeed a very fine and sturdy, if not respectably-dressed, member of the British
nation. "It's too good to be true; and I am sure I shall wake up to-night imagining that I
am still on board that train, or in the lodgings that Belgian patriot provided us with, and
in any case being chased by Germans.  Germans!  Just you wait till I get a turn at 'em."

No wonder that Henri grinned at his huge companion; it delighted him to hear the sturdy remarks
of this gallant fellow, just as it delighted Stuart to look down from his greater height at
the dapper, spruce, active, and now well-clad figures of his two most dashing French comrades.
Spruce, indeed, Henri looked, his little moustache lending a certain amount of distinction
to his face, his head held well on his shoulders, his cigarette between his lips, and the most
jaunty air about him.  There was a far-away look, however, in Henri's eyes, for he was thinking
of France--thinking of her as she was now, and as she had been when he last saw his native country.

"Mon Dieu!  What a change!  What desperate changes!" he was saying to himself.  "Every man
able to bear arms, and of a suitable age, a soldier; every one of them living the life followed
by our ancestors--those cave-men--dwelling in trenches throughout the months, fighting like
tigers to beat down the Germans.  Well, it will be good to join them, good to wear a uniform
and line up shoulder to shoulder with our fellows."

"Yes, good," Jules admitted--for Henri's last remark had been uttered aloud--his face flushing
at the thought.  "What'll they do with us, Henri?  Send us to some instruction-camp, do you
think, and keep us there fooling about, training, drilling, doing things that I hate--that
we all hate?"

"Poof!  Not they.  You seem to forget, Jules, that you and I have done our training; and, although
we may not be very skilful soldiers, we can both of us shoot, know our drill sufficiently well,
and if put to it can dig with the best of them.  No, I'm hopeful that we shall jump out of
these clothes into uniform, and shall almost as promptly jump into the trenches and find ourselves
engaged in fighting the enemy."

It was with real regret that the two Frenchmen parted with their English companion on arrival
in London.

"Of course, we'll all of us make the same sort of promises," laughed Stuart, as he gripped
their hands at parting.  "We'll swear to look one another up, to meet again shortly, and possibly,
if we are rash, to write to one another; and just as certainly we shall find it awfully hard
to meet, and, in fact, are more likely to knock across each other by pure accident than by
design.  It's always like that in warfare, and more than ever now in this conflict.  Well,
an revoir!  That's the word, isn't it, Henri?  Au revoir!  Here's wishing that we may meet
again soon; and, better than all, hoping that we shall rapidly whop the Germans.  Au revoir!
We have had splendid times together."

They had had a wonderful adventure indeed, and that escape from Germany was one which, almost
at once, gave interest of quite considerable degree to the public, both British and French.
For journalists ferreted out the fact that Jules and Henri were fresh from Germany, and though
the two young fellows were modest enough they did not hesitate to tell their story.  Thus,
as they sat in the express train which took them to the sea-coast on the following day, they
read a full account of their own doings.  A few hours later they were in Paris, and at once
reported at the Ministry of War.

"Bravo!  So you are back from Ruhleben, mes enfants.  Welcome, welcome!" cried the officer
who interviewed them.  "And now, of course, like good sons of France, you have returned at
once, at the very earliest moment indeed, to fight France's enemies--the Boche, the Hun, the
despicable ruffian whom the Kaiser and his war lords have sent in our direction to wreck the
country.  Now, tell me; you have had some training?"

"Yes, mon Colonel, we have both done our course, and were on holiday in Germany when war broke
out and prevented us from returning.  We are very anxious, mon Colonel, to join in the fighting."

The old Colonel's eyes sparkled as he listened to Henri's rejoinder, and, with Gallic enthusiasm,
he smacked both young fellows heartily on the back.

"Bon!  It is fine to hear you, mes enfants.  It is grand to know that two of France's sons
have gone through such adventures in order to return to the country.  And you wish to join
in the fighting as soon as possible?  Bien!  If I can contrive to arrange it, it shall be so.
But, first of all, you must go to an instruction-camp, from which you will be drafted to regiments,
and where, of course, your uniform will be issued, as well as your kit.  Au revoir!  Good luck
go with you!"

It was a case of incessant movement for Henri and Jules, and, indeed, for weeks now they seemed
to have been travelling; first those few miles on foot in the neighbourhood of the camp at
Ruhleben, and then in the empty passenger train which had conveyed them from that dangerous
area.  Later came their trip on the supply train, and here, once more, they were packed in
a French supply train running out of Paris en route for one of the big army camps instituted
by the French.  By the following morning, in fact, they had discarded plain clothes, and were
looking critically at one another in uniform.

Jules gave vent to a light whistle, indicative of surprise, astonishment, and amusement--if,
indeed, a whistle can indicate the latter.  Certainly it was not one which displayed any sort
of tendency to admiration; while the grin which followed it made Henri quite sure that his
appearance was a source almost of ridicule to his comrade.

"What's wrong?" he demanded rather shortly.  For when you criticized Henri's get-up--the cut
of his coat and of his trousers, and in particular the hang of the latter, the colour of his
socks, and his particular fancy in boots and hats--he was apt to become quite angry. And it
made no difference now that the smart clothes which he was wont to wear had been changed for
the peculiar blue uniform of France's fighting forces, supported by a pair of army boots of
sturdy pattern, and capped by a steel helmet of distinctive style and of the same peculiar
blue colour.  Yet, withal, putting cut aside, allowing the fact that Henri, dressed as he was
now, looked tall and strong and active and upright, and quite martial too, armed with a rifle,
one had to admit that there was a huge difference between the Henri of that moment and the
dapper, elegant, well-groomed Henri of twenty months before--a Henri who in London or Paris
might quite fairly have been termed a "knut".

"Well, you do look a 'one-er'!"

"And what about you?" demanded Henri a little warmly.  "Now that compliments are flying, what
about you, mon ami?  With that pack on your back you look like a donkey laden for the market."

At that Jules grimaced, and jerked his pack higher; and, indeed, Henri had not described him
altogether unfairly.  For your French poilu--the gallant, sturdy French infantry soldier--is,
when on the line of march, if not actually overloaded, certainly apt to have the appearance
of being so.  What with his pack, his mess tins, the camp-kettle which one man among a certain
number carries, his entrenching-tools, and the little bundle of faggots for the camp-fire,
a French infantryman does indeed seem to have a vast quantity of personal impedimenta.

A sounding bugle called the two, and in a little while they were parading with a number of
other men, some of whom had already seen service, while others were new to warfare altogether--men
who possibly had been delayed from joining the colours by illness, who had contrived to reach
France from abroad, or who belonged to a younger classification.  A smart sergeant threw a
knowing eye along the line, and, striding down it, seemed to take in the appearance of every
man within a few seconds.  Halting here for a moment to adjust a belt, and there to tuck in
the tag of a buckle, he soon reached the end of the line, and, passing down behind it, adjusting
packs, putting kettles in the correct position, arranging helmets at the regulation angle,
he presently appeared in front again, and treated the squad to a smile of commendation.

"Very good indeed, lads.  Very good," he said.  "Stand easy for a moment."

Striding across the ground came a dapper officer--one of those smart, tall, well-turned-out
Frenchmen, who appear to be the essence of soldierly composure.  Halting in front of the squad,
which was drawn up at attention once more, he, too, ran his eye over the men, passed a remark
to the Sergeant which was essentially complimentary, and then advanced a few paces nearer.

"Mes enfants," he said, "there are some among you, who are but new recruits, who may have done
your musketry course already, who doubtless know something of soldiering, and yet who must
needs undergo further training; to you my remarks do not apply.  But there are others among
you who have seen service, who have engaged the Boche, and who may doubtless desire to return
to the front at the earliest moment.  Let such men step a pace forward."

Henri did not even glance at Jules, seeing that, being on parade, he must keep his eyes directly
forward; while Jules, some files to his left, did not dare to cast a look in Henri's direction.
It was strange, therefore, and yet not strange, when one remembers the spirit which animated
these two young fellows, that, without agreement, without waiting to see what the other would
do, each instantly took a pace forward, and with them perhaps a dozen of their comrades.

"Bien!  Very good!  And now we will ask you all about it," said the officer, smiling pleasantly.
"Mon camarade, you who look so strong, tell us of your experience."

He halted in front of a broad-shouldered, burly man, who was well past thirty-five years of
age, and whose chin was deeply scarred by a wound, now healed completely.

"What experience, mon Capitaine?" the gallant fellow repeated.  "Well, at Ypres, in 1915, and
before that, at Charleroi, in the great retreat past Château Thierry, and so to the south of
the Grand Morin."

"And afterwards, mon ami?" asked the officer, patting him in paternal manner on the shoulder;
for, though discipline is strict in the French army, indeed stricter in no other, there is
yet the best of feeling between officers and men, a species of camaraderie which unites them
closely.  "You have seen much service, my friend.  What then, after the Grand Morin?"

"What, then?  Mon Dieu!  There was the Battle of the Marne, mon Capitaine, when we drove the
Boche before us; and there followed the fight about the Aisne, when the British were just to
the left of us; and, later, yes later, for I have seen a great deal, mon Capitaine, there was
fighting near Arras, fighting to the north of the line later, between Ypres and Nieuport, when
the Germans assailed the British at Ypres, and lost the flower of their Prussian Guard Corps.
This is the full tale, monsieur, for I have already mentioned the Second Battle of Ypres, in
which those Huns first nearly stifled me with asphyxiating gas, and then took this chip out
of my chin with a bullet."

"And you would repay that same chip, my friend?", laughed the officer.

"Bien!  You may say that, Monsieur le Capitaine--repay it a hundredfold if I am able."

From one to another the officer passed, questioning them in the same friendly manner, inviting
their confidence, listening to their stories, extolling their actions with words which reached
the ears of their comrades.

"And you," he said at last, arriving at the gallant Henri, and tapping him on the breast with
a friendly finger, while he ran his eye over this young soldier, admiring his clean, well-bred,
active appearance, the set of his figure, his healthy looks, and the perky little moustache
which Henri still boasted.  "Well, you," he asked, "mon enfant?"

"I, mon Capitaine?  Well, I have seen but little more than the heart of Ruhleben camp," Henri
told him; "for I was there, a prisoner for many weary months."

"And then, did our friend, the Hun, think so little of you that he set you free?" asked the
officer, his eyes twinkling.  "Hardly that, I am sure, my friend, for you look as though you
could do some fighting."

Henri smiled back at him.

"No, Monsieur le Capitaine," he told him; "it was not because they wished to set me free that
I am here, but because they couldn't help it.  I escaped--I and two other comrades, one of
whom was British."

"Ah!  And you escaped--you and two comrades, one of whom was British; and because you wished--all
of you, no doubt--to fight for your country?"

"That is so," Henri admitted at once.  "We were eager to fight the Hun, and we have joined
the French army at the first opportunity."

It was the same when the officer questioned Jules, and in a trice he realized that the two
had made their escape from Ruhleben together.

"Tiens!" he cried; "one little moment.  Two young Frenchmen who escaped from Germany and an
Englishman with them--mais oui! but--vraiment!  I have read this same story quite lately. 
Ah!  I have it.  You, then, are Henri and Jules for certain?"

The two young soldiers admitted the fact with rising colour, while the glances of every man
in the squad were cast at them, and the Sergeant, that smart little fellow who had first dressed
the line and adjusted every buckle and every accoutrement, turned a pair of admiring eyes on
them.  As for the officer, he gripped each one by the hand and shook it warmly.

"It's an example to us all, mes enfants," he told the squad.  "There is great honour to our
big friend here who has seen such fighting throughout the first days of the war, the Retreat,
that Battle of the Marne where we smashed the crowing German, the conflict near Arras and round
Ypres, which barred the progress of our enemy.  To such a man there is undying honour.  But
here we have two who, though wretched, no doubt, while confined in a German prison, half-starved,
by all accounts, bullied and browbeaten, could yet have remained in that camp safe from the
danger of warfare.  But they wished to help their country; and see them here, joining up with
our forces at the very first moment.  And so, Jules and Henri, you would wish to go to the
front almost immediately?"

The two nodded their assent.

"And you have had training?"

"Pardon, monsieur," said the Sergeant, opening a book and placing his finger on the name first
of Henri and then of Jules; "here is their record.  Three years ago they did their training
and attended manoeuvres, and were reported on as excellent conscripts.  In the ordinary way
they would attend a few drills here, perhaps go through a short instruction in musketry and
bayonet exercises, and then be drafted to the front."

"Bien!  There is little else after that for them to learn but bombing and the warfare peculiar
to trench fighting--such as the conduct of trench-mortars, catapults, and other weapons of
a similar description--that they can well learn at the schools of instruction just behind the
front.  Pass them for the front, Sergeant.  Put them down to go with a new draft which leaves
for Verdun to-morrow evening. Good luck, my friends!  I wish, indeed, that I could come with you."

"Re-form line!" bellowed the Sergeant, or, rather, he snapped the order, and at his words those
who had stood forward a pace stepped back just as smartly, while every head turned as the men
dressed the line.

"Dismiss!" bellowed the Sergeant, and in a moment the squad broke up, each man going off to
his own quarters.  As for Henri and Jules, they spent some busy hours in making ready for the
coming journey; and, boarding the train with a draft of men the following evening, they found
themselves behind the Verdun lines after a longish journey.

They were near the spot selected by the "All Highest", by the Kaiser, the would-be lord of
the world, who had determined to make one more gigantic effort to crush the French and to defeat
his enemies.

CHAPTER IX

A Terrific Bombardment

There is no need to tell how Henri and Jules, now converted into poilus, joined the troops
in their billets behind the lines at Verdun; how they went to a school of instruction, where
they were coached in the minute and delicate, if not peculiar, art of bombing; how they learnt,
in fact, to conduct trench warfare, and prepared for closer contact with the enemy.  Nor need
we tell how presently they were drafted into the city of Verdun, where it lies beside the River
Meuse in a sleepy hollow facing the heights beyond, which lay between it and the Germans. 
After a residence there in billets, they crossed the river, and, mounting those heights, gained
at length the communication-trenches which gave access to the French positions in the neighbourhood
of Hautmont.

"And how do you like it?" the Sergeant in command of the platoon to which they were attached
asked them as the dawn broke on the following morning, and every man in the trench stood to
his arms in case of an attack by the enemy.  "See you, Jules, and you too, Henri,"--for let
us explain that our two young heroes were not entirely unknown to their comrades, that is unknown
by name or by reputation; indeed, the regiment to which they were now attached had, like many
another regiment, read of their exciting escape from Ruhleben, gloried in the event and in
the spirit it showed, and were ready to welcome them heartily--"you two, Henri and Jules, here
is a loophole for each of you.  You see the parapet of the trench is strengthened with logs
cut from the forest, and if you are careful not to poke your heads up above the parapet you
have little to fear from enemy bullets.  Look away down below you; the ground slopes gradually,
and there is nothing to obstruct your fire but the stumps of trees which were cut down months
ago.  Now, look still farther, and I will tell you something of the position: there, to the
left of you, is Brabant, just round the corner of the hill, though you can't quite see it,
and to the left of that again, the river, with the village of Forges just across the water,
and Bethincourt and the Mort Homme Hill close to it.  Now look to your right.  There's Gremilly
lying near the railway, and farther along still, beyond Ormes, is Cincery, and south of it
Etain, while immediately beyond are the heights of Douaumont, with Vaux closely adjacent."

Peering through their loopholes, Jules and Henri spent a useful and interesting half-hour in
watching the scene before them.  They were standing in a trench dug across the gentle slope
of a hill which at one time, in those days of peace preceding the war, had been thickly clad
with fir-trees--a slope now denuded altogether, and presenting only innumerable stumps, standing
up like so many sentinels, while those nearer to the trenches had barbed wire stretched between
them, making a metal mesh which would require most strenuous efforts to break.  Not a soul
was to be seen in front of them; not a figure flitted through the woods in the direction of
the Germans' position, while as for the Boche, there was not one in evidence, though during
that half-hour they detected the line which indicated the enemy trenches, and heard more than
once the snap of a rifle.

"And it is ever thus, Henri and Jules," the Sergeant told them.  "We stand to arms in the early
morning, just as now, waiting for the attack which, it is whispered, will be made upon us,
and which never comes. Indeed, to me it seems that the Germans have for days past given up
all idea of an advance in this direction; and sometimes not even a rifle is fired, while the
cannon is never heard."

If no one was to be seen in front of the French fire-trenches; or in front of the cunning pits
where machine-guns were hidden, there was yet ample movement, and plenty of people, close at
hand to drive ennui from the minds of Henri and his comrade.  There were soldiers everywhere
along the trench--merry fellows, who sat about the fire--for in this month of February the
early mornings were very chilly--who smoked their pipes and laughed and chatted, and who watched
as breakfast was made ready.  There were men carefully attending to trench-mortars, others
polishing their rifles, and yet others again who had crept by deep tunnels to the cunning positions
in front and were busily attending their machine-guns; and behind, along the communication-trenches,
in the support and reserve trenches, in a hundred and more dug-outs, there were more poilus
with officers amongst them, hearty, confident individuals, living a curious existence, which
had now lasted so many months that it seemed to have been their life from the very commencement.
Farther beyond still, it was impossible to see, for Henri and Jules had their duties and might
not leave the regiment; yet in hundreds of hollows there was hidden the deadly French soixante-quinze--the
75-millimetre quick-firing gun, which from the commencement of this gigantic conflict has controlled
and beaten German guns of a similar calibre.  Yet again, behind them, were other bigger guns,
splendidly dug in and hidden cleverly with straw-thatched roofs, many of them no doubt once
filling the embrasures of Douaumont and other forts which in times of yore had gained for Verdun
the reputation of impregnability.  Yet German leviathan guns had proved that they could now
smash Douaumont or any other fortress to pieces within a few hours, whereas in the old times
it had been a matter of days, when even the artillery was sufficiently powerful.  Modern invention,
high explosives, and scientific artillery had altered modes of defence, and the fort at Douaumont
and the forts elsewhere encircling the sleepy town of Verdun were now but shells of masonry,
mere billets for soldiers, while the guns were ranged out in the open.

What a busy scene it was behind the fire-trenches in which Henri and Jules were now standing.
In a hundred cunning little nooks, in corners which one hardly expected to come upon, there
were field-kitchens, where a fire might be kindled without attracting the enemy or his artillery-fire,
and where soup--beloved of the poilu--might be prepared for those on duty.

"Mon ami, it's a good thing to have warmth both without and within," said, the Sergeant who
had already befriended our two heroes, beating his hands together to promote the circulation,
and blowing upon his fingertips, for it was a chilly day this late February, 1916.  "A man
who is cold faces the enemy and the dangers attendant upon this sort of business with a courage
which is perhaps a trifle damped, while if he be hungry also, and cold within, then indeed
he is at a disadvantage. Come, a bowl of soup!  Our cook is a specialist in its manufacture,
and, myself, I think that the fellow is good enough to be chef even at the Astoria in Paris.
You know the Astoria, my Jules?"

Jules treated the Sergeant to one of those amiable smiles of his.  Did he know the Astoria
Hotel?  That aristocratic establishment in Paris. Were there many aristocratic parts of that
famous city of which he was ignorant?  It made Henri snigger indeed, remembering those days,
now it seemed so long ago, when he and Jules had been among the elegants of the city.  Yet,
if these two young soldiers had known what luxury meant, and what it was to lead a life of
gaiety, they were none the less good soldiers of France, destined to prove themselves, indeed,
as noble as any of those comrades about them.  Seated there on the fire-bench, where a man
could stand and level his rifle in the direction of the enemy, they and the Sergeant sipped
their bowls of soup with relish, dipping a crust of bread into it, and wanting nothing better.
The outdoor life, their unusual surroundings--which had not yet become so familiar to them
as to go without observation--the keen February air, the sense of danger impending, lent zest
to appetites already healthy.

"I'd as soon dine like this as anywhere," said Henri, as he tipped his bowl up and his head
back at the same time, and imbibed the steaming beverage.  "Just fancy sitting down to a five-
or six-course meal, as a fellow was accustomed to do in the days before this war commenced.
A five-course meal, Jules!  Fancy what we'd have said to such a thing in Ruhleben, where the
meals were hardly recognizable."

Jules at that moment was engaged in finishing a huge crust of bread, and, holding the remains
of it up between fingers and thumb, and balancing his bowl of soup neatly in the other hand,
was in the act of drinking from it, when a distant thud, a screaming sound, and then a terrific
concussion close at hand sent his bowl flying, and the young soldier himself rolling from the
bank upon which he had been seated. As for Henri, when Jules caught a view of what was left
of that young fellow it was to discover his friend half buried in earth, a huge log lying right
across his body, and the Sergeant, tumbled, inert and lifeless it seemed, over the log.  Then
willing hands came to their rescue, and within a moment or two all three were again seated
on the bank, the Sergeant holding his head between his hands, still dizzy after that explosion,
while Henri was carelessly brushing the dirt from his clothing.

"A near squeak, mon ami," laughed one of the poilus, as he assisted Henri in his task; "that
is the first shell that has come near us for days past, and I shouldn't mind if it were the
last of them. Understand, my comrade, that shell-fire is not all very pleasant, and there are
times when a man must sit in the fire-trench, crouching at the bottom, whilst they rain all
round him, some bursting in the trench and shattering the traverses, some thumping pits behind
or in front big enough for a platoon to camp in, and others blowing in the parapets, and smothering
the fellows behind them.  Rifle-fire is nothing to it--a mere pastime--for then, if a man keeps
his head well down, there is but little danger."

Thud!  In the distance another gun sounded.  Thud!  Thud!  Thud!  Sharp reports followed almost
instantly, and found their direction, it seemed, from a thousand different points hidden by
the forest country in front of the trenches directly north of the city.

Had Henri and Jules been elsewhere than in those trenches now assailed by the German artillery,
had they, for instance, been in the neighbourhood of the fortress of Douaumont, or even on
some more elevated position--if one were discoverable--they would have watched a sight on this
19th day of February which would have appalled them, and yet would have held them enthralled--so
full of interest was it.  Let us but sketch the view to be obtained from such a point.

From the heights of the Meuse, beyond and on which lay the French positions, crossing the River
Meuse in the neighbourhood of Brabant, one looked down to a huge plain some hundreds of feet
lower, the land falling abruptly in many parts, and the rolling hills traversed here and there
by ravines, which gave easier access to the heights above than was to be found elsewhere. 
Everywhere woods were to be seen, woods of evergreen firs clothing the country thickly about
the foot of the heights, and sweeping, to some extent, out into the plain beyond; woods, indeed,
which masked the position of the enemy, which made it practically impossible to say how many
troops were there, and whether the Germans had, as reports stated, made preparations for an
attack on the Verdun salient.

A glance at the map will perhaps make the position even clearer, for there it will be seen
that the French line, running from the west from the River Aisne, passed close to Varennes--which
was in the hands of the enemy--struck north at Avocourt, skirting the foot of hilly ground,
and so continuing to Malancourt.  From there the trench-line ran due east to Forges, just north
of the brook of that name, and, crossing the River Meuse a little north of the point where
the brook Forges falls into the river, ran north and east via Brabant, and along the line already
indicated, sweeping from Etain and St. Jean--its most easterly point--due south till it reached
the neighbourhood of Fresnes, and then curving towards the west and south, where it again approached
the river.  St. Jean, the most easterly point of the line, may be said to have formed almost
the apex of the salient made by the French trenches encircling Verdun, and the city of that
name may be said for the purpose of our description to have filled a point along a line drawn
across the base of the salient.  Perhaps thirty miles in length, this line, represented by
the River Meuse, presented numerous roads and crossings by means of which French troops could
be marched to any point of the salient, and presented also at Brabant, to the north of it,
and at its southernmost point, positions of much importance.  Let us suppose for a moment that
an overwhelming enemy force was disposed in the neighbourhood of Brabant, and another at the
southernmost point of the base of the Verdun salient--where the French trenches again ran adjacent
to the river--a blow driving in the French defences both north and south at the self-same moment
would shorten that base to which we have referred, and would, as it were, narrow the neck of
the salient dangerously; it would have the effect, indeed, of tying up the force of men holding
the apex of the salient, and of limiting their means of retreat if that were necessary, and
the power of reinforcing them rapidly from Verdun.  It may be, indeed, that this plan was in
the minds of the Germans when, on the 19th of the month in question, they commenced that bombardment
the first shot of which had proved so nearly disastrous to Henri and his comrades, and which,
commencing at that moment, played on the whole Verdun salient for two days and nights. Then
on the 21st they opened their campaign against the city of Verdun and the Verdun salient with
a mighty blow against the northern trenches, close to Brabant, where the French lines crossed
the river, and in the course of a few hours opened the eyes of the French command--which, though
well aware of an impending attack, was perhaps not fully informed as to the scale and significance
of the German preparations.  Indeed, in those first few hours of the bombardment of the northern
sector of the salient, there was repeated on this Western Front the phalanx concentration which
Von Mackensen had used against the Russians during the previous summer, when thousands of guns,
arrayed against a comparatively narrow area, burst and blazed a way through it, or, more accurately
perhaps, smashed the Russian trenches, and, unopposed by their artillery--for, as we have stated
already, the Russians were wofully short of guns and ammunition--slew the unfortunate troops
of the Tsar holding those trenches, forced their supports and reserves to fall back, and, having
gained a certain depth of territory, moved forward and repeated the process again and again,
thus compelling continual retirement.

Here then, on the 19th February, 1916--a date which is destined to become historical--the Germans
commenced on the Western Front, against the northern-most curve of the Verdun salient, a similar
attack, an attack heralded by a storm of shells thrown from masses of artillery which had been
collected for weeks past and hidden in the woods in that neighbourhood.  There were guns dug
in in every direction, guns which had been there, perhaps, since the commencement of the war;
there were others artfully concealed in natural hollows; and there were yet again others, literally
hundreds of them, parked close together in the woods and forests without other attempt at concealment--a
huge mass of metal which, at a given signal, commenced to pound the French defences. Never
before, without doubt, had such a storm of shell been cast on any one line of trenches; and
continuing, as it did, for hours, ploughing the ground over a comparatively narrow stretch,
it reduced everything within that selected area to a shapeless and tangled mass of wreckage.
It was to be wondered at, indeed, that anything living could survive the ordeal.  French trenches,
stretching across the slope behind those meshes of laced barbed wire, were blotted out--were
stamped out indeed--and soon became indistinguishable from the hundreds of cavities and craters
and holes which marked the slopes across which they had run that morning.  Fourteen-inch shells,
seventeen-inch shells, and thousands of smaller missiles, ploughed through and rained over
the line, and many a ponderous fellow found its way to the deep dug-outs and shelters which
had long ago been prepared for such an eventuality. Smoke hid the sky on this 19th of February
and the two days following, the smoke of bursting shells plunging upon the French positions,
while the cannon which threw those shells were still hidden by the tangled woods clothing the
ground occupied by the enemy.  Yet, if the gallant poilus manning the French trenches were
not in evidence, if, indeed, life was being stamped out of a number of them by this terrific
avalanche of bursting metal, they were yet for all that not entirely unsupported, for already
those guns behind the advance lines of our ally were thundering, while, overhead, fleets of
aeroplanes were picking up the positions of German batteries, and were signalling back to those
who had sent them.

Crouching in the depths of a dug-out, some thirty feet below the surface, a dug-out which shook
and quivered as shells rained above it, Henri's comrades of the platoon smoked grimly, while
that young fellow himself, once a Paris elegant, crouched in what was left of a fire-trench,
now a mere shattered pit--and peered somewhat anxiously towards the open.

"And you are there still, mon ami?" called the Sergeant, when there was a five minutes' lull
in the firing, "you find it warm perhaps, mon Henri?  But you will hold to your post firmly--yes,
you will do that, as will all our comrades."

His big, healthy, bearded face looked out from the narrow entrance of the stairs which gave
access to the dug-out, and for a while he grinned, a friendly, encouraging grin, at our hero.
Then those heavy thuds in the distance, and a loud burst close at hand, sent him diving back
to shelter, leaving Henri alone, a pipe now gripped between his teeth, his rifle slung over
one shoulder, standing his ground, gazing before him, waiting for the first sign of an enemy
attack.

"It will come soon, yes, very soon," the Sergeant said, when another lull in the firing arrived.
"They will go on blazing away, throwing tons of metal at us, till they think they have blotted
us out of existence, and then--then you will see they will swarm to the attack, these Germans."

Yet that did not prove to be the case, for, as a matter of fact, the Germans, profiting by
the lesson they had learned in Russia, and imagining that they could as easily--more easily,
in fact--repeat their exploit on this Western Front, had set out to capture Verdun by the aid
of their artillery alone, and had every confidence of smashing their way to the town with but
little else, and with but little use of their infantry.  Continuing their tempest of shells
for many hours, till it seemed that not one French soldier could have survived the bombardment
of that northern sector, they then sent forward their sappers and mere patrols to discover
what damage had been wrought, and to take over the new position.  Behind them, massed in amongst
the trees, were German battalions, prepared to advance at once and dig in and secure what the
guns had gained for them.

"Attention!  The enemy are coming," Henri bellowed through the mouth of the stairway leading
to that dug-out where his platoon was sheltering. "I can see them crossing the open."

"And the shell-fire, mon ami?  It has ceased?  No, surely not," came the voice of the Sergeant.

"Tiens!  Halt a little, my friends," said the voice of an officer sheltering in an adjacent
dug-out and coming at that moment to the exit from it, "one little moment, for shells still
rain upon the position. Keep a careful watch, my gallant Henri, and warn us in due time."

Henri therefore once more stationed himself behind the battered edge of what had been once
the parapet of a well-made trench, and peered through a broken loophole at the distant enemy.
He could see scattered parties of men trailing across the open, emerging from the distant cover
afforded by the trees, and marching steadily, without haste, it seemed, towards the French
positions.  Then, glancing to his left and to his right, he caught glimpses of other sentries
like himself, solitary Frenchmen stationed in those battered fire-trenches to watch for the
coming of the enemy--the thinnest of thin garrisons, indeed, placed there to guard the French
lines from sudden attack, and to present as few men as possible to the devouring shells cast
by the Germans.  It was the policy, in fact, of the French commanders to expose their men just
as little as was possible; to hold up the advance of enemy attacks with as few numbers as was
consistent with safety; and in the event of massed attacks, where the pressure was enormous,
to create havoc in the ranks of the enemy with their guns, their machine-guns, and their rifles--to
kill Germans on every and any occasion, and then, if circumstances dictated such a move, to
withdraw their slender garrisons to a line farther back, exchanging so many yards of territory
willingly for the losses they had forced upon the Kaiser's soldiers.  For this gigantic conflict
in the West, this warfare devouring the nations of Europe, had, after the twentieth month of
its outbreak, become more than ever a question of numbers.  With teeming millions of soldiers
at the commencement, Austria and Germany were able to fall upon their unprepared neighbours
and almost to swamp their country; but the thin line of heroes who had dwelt in those trenches
from the North Sea to the frontier of Switzerland had held the horde at bay, had kept it back
until their comrades could rush to the rescue.  Numbers were now far more equal; the toll of
Germans taken by British and French and Belgians, and of Austrians and Germans by the Russians,
had begun to tell upon the enemy effectives.  Thanks to the mighty army which Britain had collected,
the Allies were now greater in number than were the enemy, and, adopting a system devised by
the French, were carefully saving their men, willingly giving ground if need be, if its tenure
meant great losses, and always, both by day and night, taking every opportunity of killing
Germans--yes, of killing Germans, of reducing the Kaiser's ranks, and of hastening the day
when, with weakened numbers, Germany could no longer resist the onslaught of the armies of
France and Britain and Belgium.  Here, then, in front of Verdun, the French had but a mere
handful in their first-line trenches--a mere handful--upon whom that torrent of shells was
rained. Just a scattered, yet noble band, ready to hold up the assault which would most certainly
follow.

Rifles cracked along the line while those sappers and patrols sent out by the enemy--who hardly
believed life still possible in the shattered trenches--were shot down or driven back to cover.
Henri then, peering over the trench, turned of a sudden and rushed to the entrance of the dug-out.

"Come!" he shouted.  "Thousands of the enemy are coming from the shelter of the trees, and
are massing in the open.  It is an assault in force that we must resist."

Along that draggled line of trenches, which were almost blotted out of existence by now, and
over which shells still rained in abundance, men whom the Germans imagined to have been killed
long ago, to have been blown to pieces, popped out of the narrow entrances of dug-outs, clambered
up the steep wooden steps from the caverns prepared in the earth, and, digging hard, made strenuous
efforts to repair their trenches.  Others sneaked along unsuspected galleries to holes far
out in front of the line, where machine-guns were cunningly hidden; while, yet again, others
plied to and fro along the communication-trenches, forcing their way past obstructions and
falls of earth caused by the bombardment, hastening to procure more ammunition.

"It's an attack in force; hold your fire, mes enfants!" shouted the Commander of that section
of the trenches in which Henri and Jules were stationed.  "See them!  Thousands of Boches coming
from the trees and marching towards us.  Hold them a little while, my comrades, and then we
shall repay them for all that we have suffered.  Hold, my friends, for though these trenches
are now but furrows and holes in the ground, they yet give shelter enough for men who love
their country and who would resist those who are advancing."

Shouts came along the line; men called across the battered traverses to one another; poilus
sat at their machine-guns in those cunningly hidden pits, gripping the handles, their eyes
riveted upon the sights and upon the enemy.  Rifles were jerked into position, while men grabbed
at packets of reserve ammunition, and, finding some convenient ledge, placed them close and handy.

"It will be a fight to the death, my Henri," called the Sergeant as cheerfully as ever, drawing
at the stout pipe which he favoured--"a fight to the death; for not until we are wiped out
shall Germans advance over this position."

Yes, it was to be a "fight to the death"; for the opening battle of the long series of tremendous
conflicts which raged round Verdun for weeks later was to be amongst the most momentous and
fiercest of them.

CHAPTER X

The Thin Line of Heroes

"They are coming!  See them swarming from the trees yonder.  Watch them tramping through the snow!

"Steady!  Hold your fire!  Let the guns alone deal with them.  Bravo, mes amis, you are doing
grandly!  This is a day for the sons of France to let the enemy know they are still in existence."

Very quietly, with that sang-froid which the French possess, perhaps, above all others, with
determination written on every face, both young and old, and with heroism shining from their
features, those gallant poilus, all along the line sweeping across the crest of the hills facing
the Germans--a stretch of ground ploughed deep now into a hundred furrows, shattered and shell-swept,
and blasted in a thousand places into deep pits and craters--watched first as those small advance-parties,
sent by the enemy to reconnoitre the situation, were shot down or driven back to shelter; and
watched now with straining eyes and with many an exclamation as a horde of grey-coated infantry
debouched from the evergreen woods encircling the eastern and northern slopes of the approaches
to their position, and, forming up there, advanced steadily to attack them.  They were still
a great distance away, yet within effective rifle range; but as yet the time had not come to
deal with them from the trenches.  There were the guns right behind, cleverly hidden, dug in,
posted in many an odd corner, laid upon the enemy from many a crevice in the ground and many
a convenient hollow.  Indeed, already the sharp snap of those soixante-quinze had begun to
punctuate the air, and shrapnel-bursts could be seen above the evergreen tree-tops upon the
snow-clad slopes, and over hollows where the enemy were massing.  But now, as the enemy cannonade
died down a little, and that torrent of shells which had been hurtling upon the French trenches
ceased a trifle, the din of the German bombardment was rendered almost noiseless, was shut
out, as it were, was eclipsed, by the demoniacal rattle of those French 75's casting shell
at the advancing enemy.  The massed ranks marching from the cover of the trees, heads of columns
appearing at the summit of many a ravine which gave access to the heights, battalions forming
up outside their shelter, were smashed and rent by a tornado of shrapnel and shell which blew
in the faces of the German formations, which severed the heads of columns from the bodies,
which drove hideous gaps and holes in the centre of the ranks, and sent the mass, bleeding
and broken and shattered, doubling back into cover.

But if the French had withstood that terrific bombardment to which a short sector of their
front before Verdun had been subjected for so many hours, and had held on to a position, which
others might well have termed untenable, with grim determination, the Kaiser's infantry were
to prove on this eventful day--as on many another which followed--that they too were possessed
of the strongest heroism.  Governed by the strictest discipline, hounded on by armed officers
if they showed the smallest hesitation, yet, to do them scant justice only, eager and ready
for the fight in the majority of cases, the shattered ranks of the invader of France's soil
re-formed under cover--under the shelter of the evergreen trees, under a persistent deluge
of shrapnel from the 75's--re-formed, and, shoulder to shoulder, having debouched again into
the open, set their faces once more uphill towards that shattered and battered line where the
French were awaiting them.

No need to detach smaller parties to go forward and reconnoitre the ground, to tell them whether
the enemy were still existing.  It had been the sanguine hope of the Crown Prince--who was
conducting this enormous manoeuvre--and his War Staff, that what had been done in Russia might
well be repeated on the Western Front.  Guns--a superiority of guns--guns and more guns, were
the solution of the difficult problem which had faced the Germans for so many months past.
That unbroken line on the west, those Frenchmen and soldiers of Britain and Belgium, in spite
of their courage and tenacity, in spite of their trenches and redoubts and fortified positions
which seemed impregnable, might yet be driven before the hordes of the Kaiser, and that with
comparatively little loss; for, thanks to their gigantic preparations before the war commenced,
Germany and Austria had still a preponderance of guns, and shells in amazing quantities.  Here
then was the opportunity: mass the guns--bring every available piece to this spot--and turn
upon the enemy trenches such a torrent that trenches, redoubts, and fortified positions would
be blotted out of existence, a way hewn through the Western line, with the expenditure of ammunition
alone and with the loss of but few German lives.  It was theory--German theory--which perhaps
they were entitled to rely on, seeing what had happened in Russia; and yet a theory destined
on this occasion, and in the weeks which followed, to prove utterly unreliable, utterly wrong,
a grievous disappointment.  For see!  Those scattered parties sent to reconnoitre the battered
ground had been killed or driven back; the preparations for a massed attack had been broken
up and set at naught by the terrible 75's; and now, as the German infantry debouched again,
and, marching swiftly forward, came into full range of the slopes which the guns would appear
to have rendered absolutely untenable, such a storm of bullets swept the ranks that the mass
quivered, rocked and reeled, and then halted.  Torn by shrapnel from above, its lines rent
by machine-gun and rifle-firing, the attackers stood and rallied for a moment; then shouts
burst from them of terror, of hatred, and of execration, only to be followed by hoarse commands
to move forward. Then the masses broke.  Isolated units started to charge up the slopes, and
soon the mass of men, now no longer shoulder to shoulder, scattered over the slope, keeping
yet so close together that bullets could scarce miss individuals, came doubling uphill, their
heads down, their bayonets flashing in the wintry sun, their feet carving wide zigzag paths
in the snow with which the ground was covered.

"They come!  Fire on them!  Let go!  And prepare, if they come closer, to meet them with the
bayonet."

The shout went along that shattered trench-line, and men stood on what was left of the firebank,
or leaned their pieces on the edge of a shell-crater or some pit into which they had crawled
for shelter, and, turning the muzzles on the enemy, blazed into their masses.  Rifles grew
hot, ammunition became exhausted, and yet only for a little while, for men fell on every side,
and their comrades gripped at the contents of their pouches.  Half in and half out of a trench,
the sides of which had been blown into the interior almost filling it up, lying full length
on his stomach, Henri poured bullets into the enemy, as cool as any cucumber, while Jules lay
beside him, picking off his man at every shot, laughing, gesticulating, and quivering with
excitement.

"Tiens!  It's done!  They fly!  Bravo!"

Officers shook hands with their men, while poilus turned and congratulated one another: for
the thing was done.  That handful of men which manned what was left of the French trenches
had shattered the first German attack made upon the Verdun salient; and, with the help of the
deadly soixante-quinze, had driven the Germans back to the place from which they had started--had
driven back all who were still living.

"See them, those Germans still lying out there in the open," cried the Sergeant, standing now,
his head and shoulders exposed, forgetful of his wounds, pointing down the snow-clad and trodden
slopes to the part where the Kaiser's infantry had debouched from the forests.  "See, the place
is grey with their bodies; they are piled high one upon another, and there must be hundreds
of them.  Good!  This is a devilish war, mes amis, a devilish war; for see how we gloat over
their losses.  But listen still more: this is France, and none shall invade her save at their
peril."

For a while silence settled down over the scene of that sanguinary conflict, the guns of either
side going out of action, while once more no sign was to be perceived of the Germans.  Yet
it was evident enough already that gigantic preparations had been made to beat in and flatten
the Verdun salient; and, surprised to some extent as the French undoubtedly were, not by the
attack itself, but by the immensity of the German arrangements for it, that lull after the
first attack was at once put to service.  Where possible, reinforcements were sent up to the
front, while everywhere spades and picks were plied with energy.

"It's life or death to us," said an officer cheerfully as he came amongst the men of Henri's
platoon.  "See how the line has been broken up and our trenches smashed out of all recognition.
But the Germans, too, have been smashed for a while, and therefore, while they rest, let us
work and prepare other shelters.  But wait!  Yes, I have a message from the Commander.  The
Sergeant who was wounded has made a report. Tell me, then, where are those two men, Henri and
Jules, who came from Ruhleben to bear their part in this fighting?"

Smeared with earth, coated with the soil of France from their steel helmets down to their army
boots, their hands and faces grimy, their hair dishevelled, and yet their faces shining with
enthusiasm and courage, Henri and Jules stood to attention before the officer and waited.

"So it is you, you two," he said, regarding them for some few seconds--"you two, Henri and
Jules--names which every poilu seems to know most thoroughly--then, attention!  These are the
Colonel's words, uttered on the report of that Sergeant, who states that Henri and Jules showed
conspicuous courage and determination, and have set a fine example to their comrades: you are
no longer just plain soldiers of France, you are now entitled to wear the stripes of a corporal.
And now, Corporal Henri, and you, Corporal Jules, back to your digging."

If our two gallant young heroes had laboured before with energy, they now put the utmost exertion
into their work; for see what had happened! They were corporals, and had won promotion so early
after joining the French army, not because of any social position they may have had in those
days, now so long past, when these two young elegants thought of little that was serious; no,
they had won promotion for bravery in the face of the enemy, because of the example they had
set, because, indeed, they were good soldiers.  It made them flush all over; it made them more
determined than ever to prove themselves of value to their comrades; and, as we have said,
it set them digging with such furious energy that those about them marvelled, and then, taking
an example from them, well knowing that the time available for improving their shelter was
limited, they too redoubled their efforts, till the perspiration was pouring from them.

It was perhaps two hours later, when dusk was falling and the wintry air was filled with snow-flakes,
that the silence--that unnatural silence which had hung for so short a while about the northern
area of the Verdun salient--was broken by a salvo of enemy guns, and then by a roar, as each
one of the two thousand and more pieces joined its voice in the chorus.

"Into your dug-outs!  Take shelter!  Get below as fast as you can!"

The order sailed along those broken trenches, now repaired in some measure, and sent men, who
were not to remain on duty, down into the cleverly-constructed holes prepared for such an eventuality.
And then commenced once more that terrible rain of shells, those devastating explosions, those
upheavals of earth, and that process of smashing the French trenches.  The dusk grew, until
the darkness of night had fallen, and still the guns pounded, searching every inch of the line
and not sparing a single corner.  Yet, in spite of the gunners' efforts to do their best for
the Kaiser, there were still nooks and crannies where French poilus sheltered, where men controlling
search-lights played their beams over the slopes before them, and presently those self-same
beams, flung along the broken face of the wooded country below, discovered movement.

"Another attack; men creeping from the forest and forming up out in the open.  Let us hope
that our gunners and observation-officers see them," said an officer who stood behind Henri
at his post in the fire trench. "Now, my friend, shout into the dug-outs to warn the men, for
it seems to me that very soon we shall need them."

Running along the trench, Henri put his head through the narrow opening of each of the dug-outs,
while the men on either side of him did likewise.  Then, returning to his post beside the officer,
he watched, just as he had watched earlier in the day, though under different conditions; for
then, but for the indifferent visibility of the atmosphere, the scene was clearly outlined
to him; but now, what with the flakes of snow whirling hither and thither, what with the trampled
snow-slopes between the trenches and the German positions, what with the cold, flickering beams
of the search-lights, everything wore a strangely weird and ghostly appearance.  Yes, ghostly,
for the beams, travelling along those scattered lines of grey corpses down towards the fir-trees,
made play with their figures.  It looked, indeed, in that curious light, as if some of them
were kneeling, and as if others were rising to their feet and were advancing uphill; and behind
them, at the fringe of the woods, there were others, hundreds of others, seeming to stand still
just now, and different in no way in appearance from those others lying out before them.  But
wait!  In a little while, in a few minutes indeed, they were moving, they were sweeping on
under the cold, inquisitive beams of the search-light, on under the pelting hail of shrapnel
which the French 75's were now hurling at them, and, crossing those irregular lines of grey
corpses, dashing to the assault, were charging uphill at a rate which threatened to bring them
to grips with the French in a very few moments.

"Into the trenches!  Stand to your rifles!  Open fire on the enemy!"

Hoarse commands were called along the battered trenches, while once again men came stumbling
up the wooden steps of their dug-outs, or went creeping along secret channels to machine-gun
posts well in advance of the trenches.

"Now, let go at them; we have them in the open!"

A machine-gun immediately in front of Henri, hidden in a pit which was indistinguishable from
the hundreds of others formed by exploding shells, suddenly spluttered, and, as Henri looked,
the first line of German troops, racing uphill immediately before that gun, fell flat, was
wiped out, and became non-effective.  But other figures filled the place, men pushed themselves,
or were pushed, forward into the vacated position, and without halt, without pause, or so much
as a waver, torn though it was and shredded by the storm of bullets, that German mass still
came charging uphill.  Nothing stopped it.  Suffering appalling losses, their front blown in
in fifty different places, the enemy yet re-formed their ranks, and though, perhaps, retarded
in their charge, were not definitely halted.  Shouts were coming from that mass, shouts of
men worked into a fever, of men crazy with terror or with hatred; of men perhaps drugged for
this terrible ordeal, and who, having determined to capture the position, were prepared to
welcome death rather than fail in their object.

"And what if they reach us, what then?" asked Henri of the officer still beside him, who in
the meanwhile had seized the rifle of a wounded soldier and was emptying it into the ranks
of the enemy.  "What then, mon Capitaine?  A charge with the bayonet--eh?"

"Yes, a charge with the bayonet!  Make ready for it; pass the word to right and left!  Fix
your bayonets and make ready!"

But every bayonet along the line was already fixed, for indeed it is the habit of French troops
to carry them so.  Only, the men who wielded them, were they ready?  Were they as full of courage
and determination as were those Germans now so close to them?  They, the handful of poilus
whom the French High Command had alone spared for the protection of their front lines, had
they the nerve, the grit, for a hand-to-hand combat?  Shouts came from many a man, loud cheers
burst from the throat of many a bearded veteran, while one young officer sprang on the battered
parapet of a trench, and stood there facing his friends, calling to them, exhorting them, as
the rays of a search-light played on his figure; indeed, for more than a minute he stood there,
sharply outlined, a sight for all eyes, a figure which attracted the attention of every poilu
within reach of him.  And then, what a yell burst from the throats of the soldiers; they leapt
from the trenches, and as the scattered beams, falling for just a few seconds here and there
amongst them, lit up their figures, they could be seen massing on the pitted and furrowed ground
in front, prepared for a last encounter.

"Charge!  At them with the bayonet!  Bravo, mes enfants!"

A tall, lithe officer--a colonel--was in front of the men already, his sword waving overhead,
his head turned towards the men as he led them.

"Charge!" he shouted, though the sound was swept away and lost in the turmoil of cheers from
the French soldiers who heard him, and in the shattering reports of those French 75's, which,
blazing hard in the rear, registered still upon the enemy.

Then those gallant poilus who had poured over the parapets of their trenches--where such still
existed--springing from shell-holes where they had taken shelter, and emerging from every sort
of odd and unexpected corner, joined in one frantic mob, swept down under the rays of the search-light
upon the enemy, and, plunging into their midst, commenced at once a desperate hand-to-hand
encounter.

So it was where Henri and Jules were stationed, and the tale was repeated in a hundred different
places.  Indeed, on this 21st February, when the Germans had confidently anticipated a "walk-over",
and when such an event as a massed attack, or even the loss of a considerable number of their
infantry, was hardly contemplated, they found themselves held up entirely, with whole ranks
of their divisions swept away, and with the ground in front of Brabant, Haumont, and along
the northern face of the Verdun salient littered with their killed and wounded.  That torrent
of shells, which should have killed every one of the slender garrison of Frenchmen, had failed
in its effect; while the hope of gaining Verdun, the capture of which was to influence the
whole world, and particularly wavering neutrals, was as far away as ever. That desperate attack
made during the darkness broke down as others had done, and the Germans--those who were left
of them--fled to the cover of the evergreen pine-trees, leaving the poilus of General Joffre's
armies to stagger back to their battered trenches, there to prepare--not to rest, not to sleep,
for that was out of the question--but to resist still further.

CHAPTER XI

Falling Back

Down below, in a subterranean chamber, there burned a cheerful fire, a chimney taking the smoke
and flames up through the ground above and into the open.  Seated about it, more dishevelled
than ever, their chins bristly now, and their faces and hands stained a dull, dirty colour,
sat Jules and Henri and others of their comrades, resting for a time, while men of their regiment
watched for them.

"And, believe me, it has been a fight of fights," said one bearded veteran, lolling back against
the earth wall of the dug-out, a cup of steaming coffee gripped in one huge, dirty hand, and
a hunch of cheese in the other.  "A fight more bitter than any that has gone before it, and
one which will become more desperate.  Allons!  Here is death to the Kaiser!"

He smiled round at his comrades, whose faces were lit up by the rays from the flickering flames,
showing a gleaming row of teeth, and steady eyes, and features which displayed not the smallest
trace of fear, or even of anxiety.

"Death to the Kaiser--to the butcher who sends his troops to such slaughter!"

Tossing his head backwards, he let the contents of the cup gurgle down his throat, then, smacking
his lips, he held the vessel out for a further ration.

Steps on the wooden stairway leading into the dugout just then attracted the attention of the
whole party, and soon there arrived another comrade--a junior officer--to swell their numbers,
to tax the limit of accommodation down below to the utmost.  As dirty as any of his men, dirtier
perhaps, he bore about him traces almost of exhaustion, and, throwing himself on the ground,
silently accepted the drink and food which were at once offered him.  It was not, indeed, until
he had finished his meal, and until he had almost smoked the contents of one pipe-load of tobacco,
that he opened his lips to the poilus.

"And then, Monsieur le Lieutenant," began one of the poilus, a cheerful young fellow, who,
indeed, was in civil times the chum of this young officer, "you've been far, mon Commandant,
you have brought news to us?  For did you not leave us a while back to pass along the communication-trenches?
What, then, is the tale?  And are there supports and reserves at hand to reinforce us?"

Again it was to be noted that there was not a sign of anxiety on the face of this young soldier,
nor in the tones which he adopted.  He merely smiled and shrugged his shoulders, in fact, as
the officer shook his head decidedly.

"No!  No supports, and no reserves at present," he said.  "We must fight it out to a finish."

"Bien!  To a finish, my friends!" chirped in the bearded warrior, sipping at a fresh cup of
steaming coffee.  "Then it is not for us to grumble, but rather for the Boches.  For, see,
desperate men who cannot be relieved, and who will not surrender, fight like rats in a trap,
and such beasts were ever venomous.  And so, Monsieur le Lieutenant, there are none to help us?"

"None!" came the cheery answer.  "The position is as clear as daylight. It is only now that
our High Command is able to perceive that the Germans have launched a stroke at Verdun, which
is stronger, and likely to be fiercer, than any that have preceded it on any other portion
of the line.  They tried, these Boches, to burst their way through Ypres in April, you will
remember, having failed to do so in the previous October.  They have tried their hand in other
parts, and always with failure.  Now it is the turn of Verdun--a salient like that at Ypres,
and one which must be held against all oncomers.  You ask the fortunes of our other troops.
Listen, then, my friends; for by dint of crawling and creeping, often across the open--for
communication-trenches have been obliterated--I was able to reach a centre where information
had been gathered.  We, here, in the neighbourhood of Brabant, stand firm, thanks to the heroic
fighting of our comrades."

"And thanks, monsieur, to the noble leading of our officers," declared the bearded veteran;
whereat the poilus clapped their hands in approbation.

The officer's face was radiant at such a compliment, which, let us observe, was thoroughly
well deserved; for if the poilu, the common soldier of the French armies facing the Germans,
had fought well, his officer had indeed set him a magnificent example.

Much need, too, had the poilus holding the Verdun salient for the best of officers.  For the
German onslaught, though it had failed so far, had at least the prospect of future success
because of the surprise effected.  Not that the attack was entirely unexpected on the part
of the French, but surprise was great at the vast preparations and massed guns and infantry
the actual attack had disclosed to our ally. Those guns had first deluged every few yards of
the twenty-five miles of trenches from Brabant to Troyon, and later, swinging round, had been
concentrated on a narrow sector of four miles perhaps, a sector occupied by Henri and his friends
and other Frenchmen.

As to the German infantry, they were in great numbers.  Indeed, there were some seven German
army corps massed against the Verdun salient; while the French, with incomplete information
of the intending coup to be attempted by the enemy, had but two army corps to defend the positions.
Moreover, time would be required in which to bring up reinforcements; for, be it remembered,
the Verdun salient is pushed out to the east of the River Meuse, and though there are bridges
crossing the river, they are not so numerous as to allow of huge forces being rapidly transferred
across them.  A still more important factor in the position was, perhaps, the distance those
reserves must be brought before they could stand shoulder to shoulder with their comrades.
It is not mis-stating the fact on the night of the 21st February when we assert that those
two French army corps, holding a trench-line extending over some twenty-five miles, stood,
for the time being and for many hours to come, alone between the enemy and their objective.
They must fight not only to retain their positions, but must fight for time--time in which
General Joffre and his commanders could rush reinforcements to assist them.  Yet, though the
battle had only lasted one single day, it had proved every man in those two corps a stanch
fighter, every one determined to resist to the utmost.

"We here, in the neighbourhood of Brabant, my friends, hold fast as you know," said the officer,
his eyes shining with enthusiasm.  "Though the enemy have poured shot and shell on us, though
they have blown our positions up and obliterated our trenches, we are here; and, indeed, do
I not see before me a most cheery and merry company?  Yes, another cup of coffee as I smoke
and talk.  It is cold outside, and somehow coffee soothes a man's nerves after such an ordeal.
Well, then, here we are, firm, and not thinking of retiring yet awhile.  On the line to Haumont,
they, our comrades, hold their battered trenches, and, like ourselves, have taught the enemy
a severe lesson.  Then, passing to our right, you get to the Bois de Caures, which this morning
was held by a French garrison.  If we in this position were plagued with the fire of enemy
guns, in that strip of forest our friends have been deluged, and their positions torn asunder
and blown to pieces, even their dug-outs often being penetrated.  The place became untenable,
and yet it has been of assistance in the fighting.  It was mined, and when the Germans, held
off till that time by our sharpshooters, launched a division at it, our fellows slipped away
before the enemy, and, waiting till the Germans were in the wood and pouring into the battered
trenches, fired the mines, killing hundreds of them."

There came grunts from that bearded veteran, a gleam of his even white teeth, and muttered
remarks from the others seated about the fire in the dug-out.

"Terrific!" exclaimed Henri.  "Absolute murder; yet, what would you?"

"Yes, what would you?" repeated the officer.  "It is France, it is liberty, it is the right
to live as we wish for which we fight, against the oppression of a people who look upon might
as right, and who, if they could, would deprive France and Britain and all the Allies of their
liberty.  So, murder!  Yes, my comrade, but, as you observe, necessary.  If the Kaiser, seeking
for some great event, casts his hosts of men at us, our duty is plain; not an inch of ground
of the sacred soil of France must be rendered up unless absolutely necessary; while the enemy,
if they advance, must advance over the corpses of their comrades.  But let me proceed.  The
Bois de Caures was evacuated, and then the southern end of it seized once more by some of our
gallant fellows.  Then there was fighting on the line to Ornes and at Herbebois, and there,
too, the garrisons held their positions, having fought throughout the day and inflicted enormous
losses on the Boches. Elsewhere I cannot tell you what the position is, though there is rumour
that all is favourable."

Taking it in turns to go on duty, to watch the ground in front of them or to repair their battered
trenches, that slender garrison which the policy of the French High Command had placed in the
first line of trenches about the salient of Verdun waited with calm confidence for the morrow--for
the 22nd February.  Nor had they long to wait ere the conflict once more reopened.  Guns had
boomed throughout the night, and shells had continued to rain about them, but now, as light
broke, and they hastily gulped down their breakfast, the bombardment increased in intensity
along that northern sector, while presently enemy troops could be seen forcing their way up
a ravine which cuts its way between Brabant and Haumont.  Poilus in positions there were driven
back for a moment by flame-projectors, which were used freely by the enemy--spurts of flaming
liquid were scattered over them, and sometimes whole lengths of trenches set burning.  Then
the torrent of shells which was pouring upon the northern sector was increased, though that
had seemed almost impossible, in the neighbourhood of those two places. Brabant and Haumont
were shattered, the village of the latter name being flattened out and destroyed utterly. 
Shells ploughed the ground behind the French front position, so that communication-trenches,
which had suffered severely on the previous day, and support- and reserve-trenches were blown
to pieces and out of all recognition. Indeed, as the day passed, the slender garrison in that
part were forced to abandon whatever protection the ground had previously given, and, retiring
before the enemy, to fight a rear-guard action in the open.  Some three or four miles of country
behind that front line was indeed searched by the enemy guns; some indication of the enormous
expenditure of shells indulged in by the Kaiser.  The French left, resting on the River Meuse
and the centre, was thus forced backward, though the gallant garrison of Herbebois still held
on, together with a force of men on a hill just south-west of them.  Some success had in fact
fallen to the German phalanx attack on the Verdun salient. General von Haeseler, who was nominally
in command, though acting under the orders of the ambitious Crown Prince of Germany, had by
his smashing artillery-fire, though not by his infantry attacks, forced the French to abandon
a portion of their trenches, and had indeed shortened that line to which we have referred previously--that
line which formed an imaginary base to the Verdun salient.  In fact, he had contrived to narrow
the neck of the salient, though not yet very greatly, and thereby had limited the space across
which the French troops could retire in the event of the abandonment of the salient being necessary.

Repeating the process on the following day--for by then the French had fallen back to their
second line, now badly battered, at Samogneux and Hill 344--these new positions were assailed
with such a torrent of shells that by the evening they were absolutely untenable, and a further
retirement was essential.  Indeed, by the morning of the 24th, the French left, as it lay on
the River Meuse, was withdrawn to the famous Pepper Hill, so that the distance between the
new first line and the city of Verdun was considerably decreased, while that imaginary base-line,
across which the French must retreat if the salient was to be evacuated, was still further
shortened.  But elsewhere, where artillery-fire had given the enemy less assistance, where,
indeed, massed guns could not be spared to blaze a path towards Verdun, desperate fighting
held up the advance of the Germans.  At Herbebois and Ornes and on to Bezonvaux there was hand-to-hand
fighting of the most desperate nature, while at Maucourt--an advance position held by the French--terrific
execution was done to the masses of troops hurled forward by the Germans.  Here masked French
quick-firing guns caught German columns of attack, twenty men abreast and hundreds deep, at
close range, and blew them into eternity.  Yet the hordes still came on, with a bravery never
surpassed, and, in spite of every effort, in spite of a superb display of courage and tenacity,
the French were forced to retire up the slopes towards Bezonvaux, and so in the direction of
the fortress of Douaumont perched up aloft and looking down upon the scene of this sanguinary
conflict.  Towards the former of these two places the garrison of Ornes was also compelled
to beat a retreat, finding itself at Bezonvaux, at the mouth of a ravine, which ascends the
heights leading to that fortress already mentioned, which was to be the scene of a terrible
battle in days now near at hand.  To portray all that occurred on this eventful 23rd February
would be almost impossible, and certainly beyond the scope of these pages; yet one must mention
the case of those gallant Zouaves and African sharpshooters, who, to the north of Douaumont,
recaptured a wood between Herbebois and Hill 351, which is just to the south-west of it, and
lies in front of Beaumont.  Here, in spite of an avalanche of shells which was poured upon
them, and of murderous attacks launched in their direction, they held out for quite a considerable
period, and, having in turn retired upon the Bois de Fosse, were eventually compelled to fall
back upon the plateau of Douaumont.

they would have our information, propensity. We have lift to property in command, we arrogate
beautician. Talk with frivolity, we have those laziness.

Building, couple, scheme should exert system. But improvement than anybody thus. Found academy,
dipper, shape, will be merely certain musculus that he daydream them.
  His
own features, too, were illuminated by that reflected light, and those of Jules also beside
him, while an instant later the face of that other officer came into view, the one with the
sharp, mean voice, who was for shooting his prisoners.  Then a sudden exclamation escaped the
latter, and, starting forward just as the flame expired, he stared hard at Henri and his comrade.

"What's this?  What's this?" he demanded.  "Strike another light, Ernst.  I have met these
fellows before somewhere; I feel sure of it."

Grumblingly the big man who had just lit his cigarette struck another light, and, sheltering
the flame between his two broad palms, brought it close to the faces of the prisoners, illuminating
at the same time his own features and those of the officer who had last spoken.  One glance
was sufficient for Henri then, and in a moment his thoughts flew back to Ruhleben, to that
little hovel down in the corner of the camp--the tool-house--which the Germans had considered
even too good for their unfortunate prisoners.  And outside it; to that scene which he and
Jules and Stuart had witnessed on that eventful evening when they made their escape.  He could
see the rotund figure of the Landsturm sentry being heckled; the figure of the blustering sergeant
who had cross-examined him so fiercely, and had well-nigh frightened him out of his senses;
and before them a third individual--a shorter, shrivelled-up officer, risen from the ranks
undoubtedly--that one who had leapt into the tunnel and had gone scrambling along to discover
what steps had been taken by the prisoners to break out of the camp. The selfsame individual,
indeed, whom Stuart had extricated from the hole behind the entanglements and had dashed backwards
into the tunnel. Similarly, in just as few seconds, the German recognized Henri and Jules.

"Those two!" he shouted--"the men who escaped from Ruhleben with an Englishman!  Seize them!
No, no!  Let us shoot them now, for they would certainly be shot on returning to Germany."

The match died down at that instant and was dropped to the ground, leaving the group in utter
darkness, and leaving Henri and Jules in the centre wondering what to do, distressed at their
discovery, and feeling that the situation was almost hopeless.  Then, of a sudden, Henri slid
his left hand back and caught Jules by the sleeve; pulling him towards him, he whispered a
sentence in his ear; and, a moment later, plunging forward, drove his fist into the face of
the officer who had recognized him, and, pushing on over his fallen figure, burst from the
group into the wood outside.  Following on his heels, Jules cleared a path for himself, and,
hearing the crash of undergrowth in front of him, held on in that direction, heedless of the
shouts which came from the group of German officers and of the shots which were fired at them.
Five minutes later Jules heard panting in front of him, and, stealing forward, gave vent to
a gentle whisper.

"Is that you, Henri?" he asked.

"Yes, Jules," came back the panting answer; whereat Jules joined him, and the two sat for a
while at the base of a big tree, resting and recovering their breath, and wondering what they
were to do now that their presence in the wood had been discovered.

"A pretty kettle of fish," said Henri at last.  "But what luck to have escaped from those fellows;
and how mad that German officer will be to know that we have twice slipped through his clutches!
A nasty little fellow, Jules!  The sort of man who would shoot us out of hand if he had the
opportunity."

"Then the sooner we get out of this and back to our friends the better. Besides, there's that
news we have got for our commander.  Let's make tracks now," said Jules.  "By creeping along
carefully, and listening for voices, we may be able to steer clear of the Germans and reach
the open."

"Listen to them!" whispered Henri.  "It's evident they've no fear of the French overhearing
them, and that they are searching the woods for us.  That's all the better for us, Jules, as
you suggest, and by listening carefully we ought to be able to creep past them."

As it proved, the attempt to extricate themselves from their awkward position was not by any
means easy; for the discovery made by that officer, and the anger it induced, caused him to
call up a number of men who were resting in the woods within easy distance.  Sentries were
at once thrown out, so as to place a barrier between the two French soldiers so recently discovered
and the open country lying between the woods and the French positions.  Then other soldiers
were set to work to search the woods, a few of them even producing lanterns.  Yet, by dint
of crawling, of hiding in hollows and under brushwood, and by steering a course away from approaching
voices, Henri and Jules at length managed to place themselves beyond the barrier of sentries,
and, rising then to their feet, ran on through the wood till they gained its edge and emerged
into the open.

Then commenced the final stage of their journey.  Crawling over the flat plain which swept
gently down to the River Meuse, on the far side of which lay the Goose Hill, Caurette Wood,
Crow's Wood, the Mort Homme, and Hill 304--positions to win unending fame in this warfare in
the neighbourhood of Verdun--they gained at length the ground which ascended on their left
towards the Poivre Hill, and beyond that again, giving access to the plateau of Douaumont,
a plateau destined to see some of the most tremendous fighting in this conflict.  Here, anticipating
easy going and a country free from the enemy, the two stood upright--for they had been crouching
and creeping along before--and marched rapidly towards their destination.  But if that slope
had been free of Germans during the daytime--as indeed it was, for the guns of the French lining
the crests of Poivre Hill commanded it completely--the darkness which had now fallen and hidden
all objects had made a most decided difference.

There was the loud tramp of feet on the road which led from Beaumont to Vacherauville, and,
as the two drew nearer to that village, they could hear columns of men approaching along the
road from Samogneux.  A lull in the terrific bombardment, which had now been going on continuously
since the 19th February, allowed them even to hear the voices of the Kaiser's soldiers as they
closed in upon the French positions--upon that base-line to which we have referred, the line
of the Meuse, beyond which lay the Verdun salient.

"There's not a doubt about it," said Henri in a whisper, as he and Jules shrank into a hole
behind a bush and waited for a column of troops to pass along the road, "the enemy is preparing
for an attack in force to-morrow, via Vacherauville; and, with what we have already seen in
the wood, and what we hear now, we have information of the utmost importance.  There must have
been hundreds of men in the wood."

"Thousands!" Jules corrected him.  "Thousands of them!  And there are thousands here, too,
marching along this road.  Listen, now, to those guns being hauled behind the troops.  One
can only guess that there are many of them by the noise they make, and it surprises me that
our men on the far side of the river haven't heard the sounds and opened fire upon the enemy.
Wait!  What's that?"

The "that" to which Jules referred proved to be a detachment of German troops from the road
along which they had been marching, and presently figures could be seen stealing across the
grass, steadily streaming past, between them and their friends, struggling forward to take
up a position for an attack on the morrow.  Orders were given in low gruff tones by officers
accompanying those men, while now and again there came the click of accoutrements and the metallic
ring of entrenching-tools carried with the parties.  Nor was that all; for presently, when
the stream of figures had poured past for some minutes, till hundreds had gone by, in fact,
and the last of the column had halted, there came to the ears of Henri and his friend the dull
blow of picks, the scrape of spades against flints and stones, and the rattle of earth as it
was thrown out of an excavation.

"Digging trenches--digging themselves in!  Preparing for our counter-attack to-morrow!  And
digging themselves in between us and our positions!  Now, that's very awkward!" reflected Henri.

"Beastly awkward!" agreed Jules.  "But there's one thing about it--it's dark, and, seeing that
we have already escaped from the very midst of these same fellows, it seems to me that we may
hope to do that again anywhere.  Anyway, we must try."

"Certainly, we must try!  We must get through them without further delay, for every moment
now is of increasing importance."

Stealing forward from the bush, they slowly approached the line which the Germans were then
preparing with entrenchments, and could now hear from those portions closest at hand the thud
of busy picks and the ring of spades as the men employed them.  Here and there a figure was
to be seen standing up in the open, while everywhere else that column of men which had filed
past them had, as it were, disappeared, or almost so; for already, thanks to the soft nature
of the ground and to the rain which had fallen, the men had dug almost two feet down, and were
partially hidden.

"Halt!  Who are you?  Why are you not working in the trenches?"

The question was bellowed at them by one of those figures standing out above the trenches,
and, obedient to the order, losing their heads, indeed, for just one brief moment, Henri and
Jules halted.

"Run for it!" whispered Henri; "straight through the line and on into the darkness!  Come, Jules!"

Without a pause, without venturing to answer the question shouted at them, the two at once
took to their heels, and, darting in between the men labouring at the trenches, sped on into
the darkness.  Nor was there any great attempt to arrest them; for, indeed, the men had already
thrown off their tunics and had piled their arms, so that the only individuals carrying weapons
were the officers superintending the operations.  Half a dozen revolver-shots, therefore, were
all that were fired at them, and those went wide in the darkness.  Within a few minutes, in
fact, the two were secure from all pursuit, and, provided there were no advance-parties thrown
out in front of the Germans, might hope to reach their friends without further incident.

"But it is more than likely that pickets will have been posted, so as to avoid a French surprise,"
said Henri, "and, although I cannot claim much acquaintance with German methods as yet, one
can imagine that sentries also have been sent towards our positions.  Let's go on in silence,
listening every now and again."

Stealing on through the darkness, they passed on more than one occasion a ghostly figure standing
erect and motionless, keeping guard against the surprise of his comrades digging those trenches
lower down the slope.  Once, also, a figure suddenly sprang up before them--the figure of a
German scout--a diminutive individual, who, not unnaturally, took them for comrades instantly.

"What now?" he said, standing within five feet of them.  "Reliefs, or an advance-party in front
of the main force?  Surely not that, for it's time for us all to have a little rest, after
the fighting we have experienced."

"Reliefs!" Henri told him instantly.  "You are to return and report at the trenches.  Go now,
for we have fed, and no doubt you are hungry."

"Hungry?"  The man almost exploded at the words.  "Hungry?  I am as empty as a drum," he told
them.  "But there, you have come to relieve me, so good-bye!"

He swung off at once into the darkness, and, waiting till he had gained perhaps a hundred yards,
Henri and Jules sped on again towards the French lines, and, clambering up the steeper slopes
of the Côte du Poivre, were finally challenged.

"Halte!  Qui va la?"

"Friends!" they answered.

"Then advance one--without arms."

It was with a shout of joy that their comrades welcomed them back to the trenches, and almost
immediately they were sent along to report to the Commander, receiving his congratulations
on their safe return.

"This is information of the greatest importance," he told the two when he had listened to their
story; "though, to tell the truth, the movement the enemy are making has been expected and
even anticipated. Go and get a meal at once, while I report what is passing.  But let me say
that you have behaved wonderfully well, my Jules and my Henri, and your Commander will not
forget to mention the matter.  Adieu! To-morrow we shall see something more of those movements."

Yes, to-morrow!  For as the 24th February dawned, and the grey light broke over the slopes
of the Côte du Poivre, the Hill of Talou, and the winding Meuse gliding along between the hills
which formed the main French positions to the west and to the east of it, the enemy guns, which
had not rested for many hours since the outbreak of this gigantic conflict, broke out with
terrific energy and commenced to deluge the French positions.  Then, down on the lower slopes,
on that plain and in the hollows, thousands and thousands of Germans sprang to their feet and
dashed forward.

Henri and Jules and their comrades were, indeed, on this day, and upon those which followed,
to experience fighting beside which that which had taken place on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd
February had been almost child's play--a grim, furious struggle was about to open, in which
hand-to-hand contests were to be almost general, and in which that sturdy handful of poilus
were to be called upon to make yet again the most gallant efforts.

CHAPTER XIII

Douaumont Fortress

"They come!  See them, in their thousands!  They are breaking from the trees and the hollows!"

"Thousands of them!  Hordes of them!  Swarms of the Boches!"

Amidst the storm of shells which the German massed guns were pouring upon that narrow front
stretching from the Côte du Poivre past the Côte De Talou to the River Meuse, heads popped
up from battered trenches, from shell craters, from fissures torn in the ground by high explosives,
and hardy, bristly, dirty poilus, stared down the slopes through the wintry light and watched
the enemy approaching.  That gallant band indeed, sadly thinned since the opening of the Verdun
battle--a battle destined to last longer than any recorded in all history--looked on grimly
and waited.  Waited expectantly, not in fear and terror lest they should be decimated, not
even in doubt or trembling, for the desperate conflict which had been waged so far had taught
the French one thing very thoroughly--man for man, they were as good as, nay better than the
Germans; gun for gun, their own artillery was at least as dexterous and as exact in its ranging,
and, so far as it went, gave wonderful support to the infantry.  All then that remained was
to withstand that terrible torrent of shells, and wait. To discover shelter of some sort which
would protect their bodies and allow them to remain alive till that moment when those grey
masses down below got within reach of them.

"And then you shall see, my Henri and my Jules," the sergeant who had spoken up for them on
the previous day said, smiling grimly.  "These shells that fall about us--pooh!  What are they?"

At that moment a 15-inch shell plunged into the ground just behind the parapet--into ground
already torn and plastered with shell fragments--and, burrowing at least ten feet deep, at
last exploded with a muffled roar, setting the earth trembling, shaking in the sides of the
battered trench, and sending up tons of soil, which fell in a cascade all round them.

"Poof!  What are they?" he said again, saluting in the direction of the exploded shell.  "But
nothing!  But something to snap one's fingers at! To laugh at!  To chortle over!  Something
to avoid, though, my Henri and my Jules!  Not that a man is so careful of his body in these
days. Though he is anxious to retain his life, yet not for himself only, not that he shall
live on to see the end of this warfare and the victory of the Allies.  No, no!  But so that
he shall live to pull a trigger as the enemy draws nearer, and so help to destroy the German
effort."

You would have thought, to look at Jules's face, that he was listening to quite a merry conversation;
for that young man was smiling broadly, and, though shells still pitched about them, though
many a shrapnel-burst high overhead plastered the ground with bullets, even twitted his comrades.
But Henri was stern and severe, and even looked a trifle nervous: such was the difference in
their characters.  Yet Jules knew, the Sergeant knew, all his comrades knew, that when it came
to the pinch, when it came to close fighting, there was no one more to be trusted than the
sterner of these two young fellows.  Ducking now and again, for somehow he could not help it,
turning his eyes anxiously every few minutes in the direction of the enemy, his fingers locking
themselves about his rifle and toying nervously with the buttons of his tunic, Henri did indeed,
at that moment, look ill at ease, to say the least of it.  And yet he too smiled as that shell
burst, and, turning a moment later, smiled once more as he pointed towards the enemy.

"Wait!" he told Jules and the Sergeant.  "They give us shells here in plenty, those Boches,
they keep a torrent of them tumbling about our ears both day and night; but wait, I say!  For
remember what we saw from the forest, Jules!  Those masses down below, the village of Vacherauville
and the road to it, the slopes of the Côte de Poivre and of the Côte de Talou, are enfiladed
by our guns across the river.  Wait then!  The gunners have not opened yet, but when the word
comes, such a storm of shell will be poured upon the Germans that they too will learn what
shell-fire really means."

His words, indeed, proved to be almost prophetic, for though, for some few minutes longer,
the thinned garrison of the French trenches in those parts waited and watched the enemy masses
advance, almost unobstructed, yet in a little while, and very soon after the machine-gunners
had got into action and rifles were speaking sharply from every direction, there came sudden
salvoes from across the river, from Charny Ridge, from the hill of Mort Homme, and from that
of 304--high ground, in fact, almost continuous with the Hill of Talou. Taking a bird's-eye
view of this particular position of the salient of Verdun, one sees the River Meuse flowing
from south to north, winding in big bends through the hills which bound the valley, while,
on those same hills to west and east of the river, eminences project which form the positions
with which we are dealing.  Running almost due east and west, there are Hill 304 and the Mort
Homme, with Charny Ridge closer to the river and overlooking it.  Then comes a flattened piece
of land which is marshy in the winter, and through which the river winds, forming a big bend,
and flowing in that part in an east-and-westerly direction.  At Vacherauville--lying close
to the eastern bank of the river--the next outcrop on the banks of the Meuse is the Côte de
Talou, and, still east of it, the Côte du Poivre, while a little farther east, in the neighbourhood
of Louvemont, the heights sweep round abruptly to the south to Douaumont, and then to Vaux,
towards which those outlying parties of French who had held on so stubbornly to Herbebois,
Ornes, and Maucourt, and had retired towards Bezonvaux, were now being driven by the enemy.

A glance at the sketch attached will show at once that the hills we have mentioned to the west
or left of the River Meuse, and those to the right, form, as it were, a gateway through which
the river passes, entering the gateway at Vacherauville and emerging at Cumières, where a wood
and a village nestle close to the river.

Then let us imagine troops marching along roads running parallel to the river in a southerly
direction, with the intention of forcing their way through the gateway we have delineated,
or rather of forcing their way up the slopes of the Côte de Talou and on to the Côte du Poivre.
The roads which they must follow are clearly under command of the guns posted on Hill 304,
the Mort Homme, and Charny Ridge, which enfilade the position.

Such was the condition of affairs on this eventful morning, when, having driven in the northern
portion of the salient at Beaumont, and shortened its baseline, the Germans once more threw
their masses to the assault in the desperate effort to drive in the wedge they had already
inserted, to stampede the French at that position, and, breaking through their lines, to get
behind the apex of the salient and entrap the thousands of Frenchmen holding the trenches from
Douaumont and Vaux down to the southern portion of the salient.

"A brilliant stroke!" you will say.  "The outcome of most able generalship on the part of the
Germans."  But wait!  Clever though the enemy was, thoughtful though the German High Command
had proved itself to be, and tremendous though the preparations for this battle were, there
was yet something vital lacking in strategy.  The Germans had counted on their guns to smash
a way through any sort of defence, and though it is true that their plans had miscarried in
one respect, and they had discovered already, to their considerable cost, that guns alone were
not sufficient, yet guns and men together, they had learnt during the initial stages of this
battle, were enough first to pound the enemy trenches, and then to drive out the defenders.
Reckoning now upon a similar course of events, and, having already pounded the French position,
they launched on this morning hosts of grey-coated infantry at the Hills of Talou and Poivre,
above which Henri and Jules were fighting.

Posted on an eminence in the neighbourhood of Samogneux, the German High Command, safe from
the rifle-fire of the French, watched through their glasses as those sinister lines of grey
swept from the wood in which they had been taking cover, and, marching steadily over the ground,
advanced upon their objective.  And then they too heard that sudden salvo of guns from across
the river, and, turning their glasses, surveyed the Mort Homme and Hill 304, positions to which
they had given but little consideration.

And see the result!  75's, machine-guns, howitzers, and rifles, all concealed, all dug in or
sheltered, and all amply provided with ammunition, poured a storm of shot and shell and bullets
upon those advancing grey masses, sweeping them away, shattering the ranks, treating them to
a hail of steel beside which the fire of the defenders of the higher slopes of the hill the
Germans were attacking was but as a shower compared with a tornado.  German infantry melted
away under that terrible storm, masses of grey were levelled like corn at the feet of the reaper,
while even the forest, through which Henri and Jules had penetrated on the previous day, was
flattened or torn to shreds, was converted into a species of smoking volcano.  It was terrific!
It was a master-stroke on the part of the French Command, and a shattering misfortune to the
enemy.  Indeed, it took the sting out of their attack entirely; it sent those of their men
who had survived this awful ordeal racing back to cover; and it put a peremptory and sudden
stop to the cunning German effort to drive in that wedge they had already inserted along the
Meuse and so to shorten dangerously the base of the Verdun salient.

"Fall in, men, fall in!  We are going to move from the position, handing it over to others
of our comrades.  Fall in there, men!"

"A move!" ejaculated Jules.  "Then where to?"

Henri shrugged his shoulders.

"Anywhere--who cares?" he declared, with a species of desperation. "There's fighting all round,
so one place is neither worse nor better than another.  But there's one thing that is quite
apparent; men are hardly wanted here any longer, and a thin sprinkling of our soldiers can
hold these trenches quite as easily as hosts of them.  For the guns yonder, those guns on Mort
Homme and 304, command the Côte de Talou and the Côte du Poivre far better than could our rifles;
so our commanders, who no doubt want men in other places; are thinning out our lines and are
sending us to reinforce another portion of the salient."

Creeping along the battered trenches, crawling across masses of tumbled earth, where communication-trenches
had once existed, and, by slow degrees, moving to a part where a fold in the ground gave some
shelter, though little enough, from the shells which the German guns still sent, the depleted
regiment to which Henri and Jules belonged was finally massed in the hollow, and, having been
fed there and rested for a while, was marched to the east, towards the fort of Douaumont. 
That night, indeed, after darkness had fallen, they once more repeated the process of scrambling
along shattered trenches, and when the morning of the 25th dawned--a cold and bitter morning
with snow-flakes filling the air and whirling across the landscape--they found themselves looking
down the steep slopes of the plateau of Douaumont, towards the German positions, and watching,
spellbound almost, another demonstration of the power and skill of the German gunners.

"Yes, my friends, they have been at that for hours past," a comrade lying beside them in the
trenches told them, as he pointed a finger at the dull-grey outline of Douaumont fort, lying
not so far from them. "Believe me, one would have thought, from the number of shells they have
fired at the place, that there were thousands of Frenchmen sheltering there whom they hoped
to destroy completely.  And so they have dropped shells on the place, big shells--Mon Dieu!
as big as I am--middle-sized ones, and small ones--in fact, grandfathers, fathers, and children--till
the place has been pounded to atoms.

"And so you have come at last, you fellows," he went on when the three had watched, for a while,
more shells hurtling into the ruins of Douaumont fort.  "Well, you are wanted, wanted badly,
for we've fought our way back from Ornes and Bezonvaux, and there are precious few of us left
to do more fighting.  You are fresh at the game--eh? my comrades."

"Fresh!" ejaculated Jules, looking quite indignant.

"Bien!  But I hardly meant that," the poilu told them.  "In appearance you are not fresh. 
No, certainly not; far from it.  But then, who of us can turn out nicely under such circumstances?
Look at me, I ask you; a mere mud-heap.  And so I have been since the battle commenced.  And you?"

"And we," laughed Henri, "we are in a similar sort of position.  But what would you?" he declared,
shrugging his shoulders in truly French fashion.  "For listen, mon ami!  Like you, we have
fought our way back from Brabant, from the lines stretching along past Herbebois and Ornes.
We have been in the thick of the fighting, hiding in caves deep down in the earth, in dug-outs
which shook as the enemy shells burst above them, crawling from shot-hole to shell-crater,
living in earth battered and shaken all day and all night, and thankful to get an hour's sleep
at any time, and a bite and a drink to keep us going.  'Fresh,' did you say?  Certainly, mon
ami, we are fresh, if by fresh you mean we are willing and ready for more fighting."

"Bravo!"

The poilu, his mouth wide open in a huge grin, gripped Henri's hand and shook it heartily.

"Mais!  Mon Dieu!  That is your sort!  That is our sort!  That is the French sort!" he cried
loudly.  "It's that kind of spirit which will carry us on, and which will help us to beat these
fellows.  Then I was right, you are 'fresh' men who have come to reinforce us, and badly do
we need your assistance."

Pulling their coats about them, turning up their collars so as to keep out the whirling flakes
of snow, beating their arms about their bodies and stumbling up and down the trenches, the
troops watching on the heights above Douaumont, dodging the German shells still flung at them,
waited as the 25th February grew gradually older, and the light grew stronger.  Something in
the air seemed to tell them that this was to be a sterner day than any that had preceded it,
and yet there was that about the artillery-fire of the enemy which rather contradicted that
feeling.  For while everything up to the 24th of the month had gone in the favour of Germany,
and while she had gained enormous successes--thanks to her long-continued and secretly-made
preparations--yet now the elements themselves turned against her--and in all conscience she
had had difficulties enough before, considering the terrific resistance shown by those French
heroes.  It was snowing, banks of snow-clouds filled the heavens, while whirling flakes made
artillery-fire a matter of extreme difficulty.  True, big guns, long since established on concrete
foundations and quite immobile, could still register by the map as accurately as ever, and
still poured shells of large dimensions on Fort Douaumont and on other sectors; but the smaller
guns, mere babes compared with those 17-inch howitzers, yet guns flinging missiles which pounded
the French trenches, could now only fire aimlessly, so that the torrent of shells was reduced
and became a mere nothing to that formerly experienced.

"They will not attack," a poilu gave it as his decision, and very decidedly.  "These Boches
never attack unless they have first cut up the ground and smashed our trenches; therefore I
vote for a brazier here, something to cook, and a pipe of good tobacco."

"And perhaps a game of manne, too," laughed another.  "Well, a little rest, after what we have
gone through, will do us no harm, and will fit us all the more for what is to follow.  Who
cares!  To-day, to-morrow, or even later, we shall fight.  If not to-day, well, let us make
the most of it."

Cheery groups collected in the trenches all along the line, men who hardly took the trouble
to peer out over the parapets and watch for the coming of the enemy.  It looked, indeed, as
if this 25th February was to be a day of rest--one sorely needed by our allies.  And then,
of a sudden, an alarm spread along the trenches; men sprang to their arms and gripped their
rifles, while machine-gunners dived into cunning approaches to hidden pieces out in the open,
and, scuttling along, manned those instruments which were to send death into the ranks of the
Kaiser.

For the enemy were not to be denied, were not to be put off even though the elements were against
them.  Realizing now that guns alone were insufficient, that losses must be sustained if they
desired to capture Verdun and its salient, they had hardened their hearts, and, determined
to risk all in this venture (for part of their success, if they captured Verdun, would consist
in the rapidity of such capture), now launched the Brandenburg Corps against the Douaumont
position, convinced that if only they could capture what remained of the shattered fort, and
set foot on this upland plateau, they would command the French positions along the heights
of the Meuse, would command, indeed, those guns, posted on Mort Homme and Hill 304, which had
assailed them so severely on the previous day, and would thereby easily smash up further French
resistance and gain their objective.

"Stand to your arms!  Watch the ravines!  For we have news that the enemy are advancing up
them.  Hold your ground at all cost, no matter what your losses, for these are the orders."

Without haste, without excitement, with that grim, steady courage which had stood the French
poilu in such good stead already, the men gripped their rifles and made ready for another German
onslaught.

"Hold on, whatever the cost!" one man repeated to another.

"Till death, if need be," came the answer.

CHAPTER XIV

Frenchmen and Brandenburgers

Forbidding and grey, shell-marked and shattered and battered out of all recognition, yet of
such a substantial nature that even the high explosives and the ponderous shells dropped upon
it by the German gunners could not entirely demolish it, the fort of Douaumont stood up, cold
and black, on that morning of Friday, the 25th February, seeming even to overshadow the trench,
or the apology for a trench--for here, too, shells had done their work--in which Henri and
his friend were lying.  Out beyond them the shell-marked ground, across which flakes of snow
were drifting, descended abruptly to the plain of the Woevre; and struggling up its slopes
came, at that moment, the 5th Division of the 3rd Brandenburg Corps--a corps retired from the
fighting-ranks months ago, specially fed, specially trained and armed, and prepared particularly
for this Verdun fighting.  Its 6th Division was, at the moment, invisible, for it was creeping
up the ravine of La Voche, which sheltered it from the fire of the French defenders.

There is no need for us to repeat the tale of terrific fighting, of the stubbornness and gallantry
of the Germans, and of the heroic resistance of that thin band of French poilus who still held
the main outposts of the Verdun salient.  Let us but say that they had been driven in four
miles from the northern posts they had held, and on the east had been forced to fall back via
Bezonvaux.  But those positions had been but flimsily held, but indifferently fortified, when
compared with the main defensive positions arranged by our allies.  They were back upon that
main defensive line now, where it swept from Vacherauville, on the River Meuse, opposite the
Mort Homme and Hill 304, across the hill of Talou and Pepper Hill--ominous names already to
the enemy--past Louvemont, and so to Douaumont and Damloup, where the trenches had now descended
to the plain of the Woevre, and they held to it till they clambered once more up the slopes,
and so to the other end of the base of the salient.

Checked on their right, where the 5th Division was advancing, the Brandenburgers were swept
from the face of the earth by a tempest of shot and shell; but their 6th Division, advancing
up the ravine in front of the shattered fortress, finally burst from cover, and, supported
by a torrent of projectiles from the German guns, hurled itself from a close point upon the
French defences, and, in spite of the heroic resistance of these soldiers, forced them back.

It was at that particular period that Henri and Jules and a dozen or more of their comrades
found themselves in a portion of the fire-trench cut off from their comrades, who had retreated,
and already almost surrounded by Germans.

"It's all up!  We are surrounded!  We are captured!  Vive la France!" shouted one of their
number; while others looked about them, at first doubtfully, and then with grim resignation.

"Yes, captured!  Better lie down in the trench till we are discovered, or else those Huns will
fire into us," counselled another of the men.

"And give in like that!" shouted Jules indignantly.  "Give in without trying to crawl back
to our people?"

"Crawl back!" a corporal answered him hotly.  "As if we shouldn't do that if it were possible.
Look for yourself, man; you've eyes in your head.  See the lines of Brandenburgers between
us and our people!"

As a matter of fact, just at the moment when he was pointing to a thick though somewhat scattered
line of grey-coated infantry which had now swept on beyond them, a gust of wind came whirling
round the corner of the shattered fortress, singing and whistling over the summit, and bringing
with it heavier flakes of snow which obliterated the scene about them and made vision almost
impossible.

"Well, then!" added the heated Corporal.  "Even snow won't help us; for we don't belong to
the Flying Corps, and can't, therefore, very well ascend and drop beyond them."

"But----" exclaimed Henri, who had been using his wits and his eyes all this time, and, though
bound to feel somewhat helpless, seeing the position in which he and his comrades found themselves,
was yet not quite resigned to the idea of becoming a prisoner.  ("Not much!" he told himself.
"I've had some!--as they say in America.  Ruhleben was a lesson which has taught me that the
lot of a prisoner is hardly inviting.")  "But----" he called out.

"But----" shouted the Corporal back at him, standing quite close to Henri, and bellowing in
his ear; for, indeed, the little fellow was very excited.  "But you would like to call us cowards
next, because we will not charge after the Germans."

"One moment," Henri said, patting him on the shoulder, "one little moment, mon cher ami!  Neither
you nor I wish to be prisoners, eh?"

"Vraiment!" the little fellow answered, a trifle mollified, his anger oozing out at the tips
of his fingers.  "But then----  Ah!  It is Henri, eh?  I did not recognize you earlier.  Then
what do you advise, Henri--you, who have tasted prison life in Germany?"

"Yes, yes!  Let Henri tell us," called a number of the others; for already our hero had won
no small reputation amongst his fellows.

Let us advance the story just a little and explain that already that officer to whom Henri
and Jules had given a report of their reconnaissance had urged upon his colonel that they should
be promoted instantly, and even then, as the conflict raged about Fort Douaumont, their names
were in Regimental Orders.  They were to be "non-commissioned" officers.

"What then?" the little Corporal asked again, eagerly peering up at Henri, for he was some
inches shorter.

"I believe you, my dear fellow," exclaimed Henri.  "Not being a bird, or, as you rightly observed,
not belonging to the Flying Corps, we cannot very well get back to our fellows, that is, not
yet.  But--and that is just where you chipped in and prevented my saying what was in my mind--but
we fellows might manage to hold out if we had some sort of decent cover."

"Aye!  Cover--that's it!  Out here we should be shot to rags," exclaimed a veteran.  "Now,
Henri, let's have your decision, and quickly, too, for the snow may stop at any moment."

"Then here it is: take up every cartridge you can find--boxes of ammunition if you can hit
on them--get as much food from the haversacks of the killed as you can carry, and then let's
creep towards the fort. There's a gateway on this side, for I noticed it in the early hours
of the morning.  Let's get behind those concrete and stone walls and search for a spot where
we can hold out and stand a siege till our fellows counter-attack and relieve us."

The veteran poilu of the party smote his hands together and tilted his steel helmet backward.

"Mon Dieu," he cried, "but that is it!  Our Henri has thought of a splendid thing for us. 
Ecoutez!  Then I will tell you, I who have been of the Verdun garrison, not only during this
war, but in peace times, I who helped to remove the big guns when the Kaiser showed us that
guns behind a fort were no longer useful.  There are caverns underneath that masonry, my boys,
big galleries, and fortified chambers, to which even a big shell will hardly descend.  Yes,
there are rooms down below in the bowels of the earth which will shelter us, and hundreds beside
us. It is a magnificent plan.  I, who know the place, can lead you; and, of a truth, we will
find a spot where men such as we are, fighting for France, can hold up a hundred of the enemy.
Be busy, then!  Pick up cartridges, seek for food and water."

"Yes--and water!" shouted Jules, darting from the trench and stooping over the nearest figure.
All about them were the battered trenches of that thin force of noble Frenchmen who had fought
hand to hand with the Brandenburgers.  There were the bodies of the slain--of friend and foe--lying
in every sort of posture, some half in and half out of the trenches; some, alas! unrecognizable,
for such is the effect of high explosives; and others, yet again, almost buried already by
upheavals of earth as shells burst close beside them.  There were not a few wounded, too, who
lay waiting the succour which might come some hours hence, and which, it was quite possible,
might never come, for in a little while, no doubt, French fire would command the ground on
which they lay, and neither troops nor hospital bearers could cross it.

Very eagerly, then, for every one of the men in Henri's party was anxious to escape capture,
and eager to rejoin the French forces and again fight the Germans, the poilus scrambled about
in the battered trench, or closely adjacent to it, taking up cartridges, despoiling the dead
of their haversacks, from which they ejected all but the food contents, while every man loaded
himself with as many water-bottles as he could conveniently carry.

"It's still snowing hard," said Henri, when some ten minutes had passed and the band was again
collected.  "Don't let us get into a flurry, or spoil our chances by being too hurried.  Let's
number off, and see how many we are."

"One!  Two!  Three!"----

Without a word of command the man on the left started, and Henri, at the far end of the line,
announced his own number.  It was twenty.

"Good!" he told them.  "More than I thought.  Twenty resolute men fighting for France, for
la belle France, my comrades----"

"Ah!  For la belle France, for home, for victory!" the veteran shouted.

"Yes, for victory.  And listen, my friends; we may help towards it," Henri told them.  "Resolute
men, if they can reach some strong position in that fort, may well assist our friends battling
farther back on the plateau.  Well, now, there are twenty of us, and I see that there are half
a dozen or more ammunition-boxes."

"Ten," the veteran corrected him instantly; "ten, Monsieur Henri"--it had come to "Monsieur"
now, such was the veteran's opinion of our hero.

"Good!  Ten boxes of cartridges is it?  Ten thousand rounds.  Now let's see to the water-bottles.
How many are there?"

The men, on returning to the spot where Henri stood, had at once deposited their finds at the
bottom of the trench, so that there was no difficulty in making an inventory; and now a mere
glance discovered the fact that there were more than two water-bottles per man, all filled,
as Henri was assured, and all big ones.

"One bottle will last a careful man, say, two days, eh?" he asked.

"In the dungeons of the fort, three days, Monsieur Henri," the veteran replied; "and, besides,
it's bitterly cold weather, when a man does not need to drink so much."

"And food?  Well, we must guess at that; but it appears from the number of haversacks, and
from the way in which some of them are bulging, that there will be sufficient for some days."

"One mo'!" called Jules at that instant.  "Each man's got his rifle and bayonet, that's understood;
there's ammunition, say, for a four-days' fight, and water and food also.  Why not a machine-gun?
Here's one abandoned by our fellows when they were forced backward."

Some of the men almost burst into a cheer, while two of them dashed forward, and, dismantling
the gun, shouldered the tripod and the barrel.

"Good idea!" Henri told him.  "The difficulty, though, will be to carry in sufficient ammunition.
But listen to this, you fellows; let's make tracks for the fort at once, decide upon a spot
to hold, and deposit our belongings; then, if the snow continues and the Germans keep away,
we'll creep out again and look for further ammunition."

They began to move off along the trench at once, the veteran and Henri leading, and Jules and
the stout little corporal bringing up the rear. Staggering along, loaded with ammunition and
water and food which they had collected, bending as low as possible and holding to the trench
so long as it continued, the little band were soon directly under the walls of the fort, and
though they peered anxiously about them, looking for the enemy, whose shouts, indeed, they
could hear in all directions--even from the fort itself--yet not once did one of the Kaiser's
soldiers approach them, while all the time the snow fell silently upon the fort and its surroundings.
Then the gate seemed suddenly to open in front of them, and marching in--staggering in, indeed,
for they were very heavily laden--they followed the veteran into a shattered courtyard, and
from it down a flight of steps to a gallery beneath--a wide gallery with earth roof and cemented
floor, along which ran steel rails.  Indeed, there was a trolley on those rails, over which
Henri stumbled.

"A trolley to run the ammunition round to the guns," the veteran exclaimed, "but useless now,
my Henri, quite useless," he chuckled. "For, you see, the guns are behind the fort, and have
already sent some of their shells into the enemy."

"That being so, this trolley will do to carry our produce.  Pile your ammunition here.  That's
it.  Those ammunition-boxes will weigh less heavily on you when stacked on this trolley.  Now,
my friend, which way?  We are in a deep gallery which seems to be lighted by tunnels running
to the outside.  Do we turn left or right, or whither?"

The veteran turned to his right without a word, while Henri and one of the men followed, pushing
the trolley. Splendidly, there would be nevertheless, food "idea." The way has been sink before
fe did take nothing.

Meantime rifles there were busy staring away the flames. Time continued about across the last went

  Jules and his men will descend
the stairs and hunt round the fort, while our corporal and his party will retrace their footsteps,
pushing the trolley with them, and will bring in to us as much food and as much small-arm ammunition
as they can find, and then boxes of ammunition for our machine-gun."

The band of resolute poilus, whose eyes were now sparkling with excitement, for but a little
while before they had resigned themselves to capture by the enemy, now separated, each man
bustling about; while the veteran amongst them, Jules, and the corporal, snapped out orders,
barked them, indeed, and sent their willing men flying.  As for Henri, he went hither and thither,
first watching one lot of men and then another; and, as they worked, as the veteran and his
men sought for obstacles, and by lucky chance found them--for it happened that the French had
stored sacks of grain for their transport animals in one of the chambers--while Jules and his
men reconnoitred their surroundings, and the corporal, moving very swiftly and with intelligence,
returned more than once laden with supplies from outside, the snow-flakes still whirled about
the place, still enveloped the fort of Douaumont, to obtain which the Germans had now spent
so many lives--spent the lives of their men indeed like water--and which they now almost surrounded.

Shells shrieked overhead, sent from those guns long since embedded in concrete, down under
shelter of the evergreen fir-trees surrounding the salient of Verdun, while other shells, smaller
missiles, shrieked and exploded as they hurled their way hither and thither, cast at random
now, for the thick weather made shooting almost impossible.  There came, too, through that
embrasure, or through the gateway of the fort, every now and again, the rattle of rifles, the
sharp tap-tap of machine-guns, and the snap and bark of the soixante-quinze as the French sent
their curtain-fire out beyond the plateau.  There was fighting still to the left and to the
right of the fort, in the neighbourhood of Thiaumont farm and the village of Douaumont, while
to the right, towards Vaux, the flash of weapons was sometimes visible. More than that, voices
could be heard near at hand, the shouts of Frenchmen somewhere, either in the fort or closely
adjacent to it, and presently the calls, the loud commands, of Germans.

It was, indeed, only half an hour later, when, thanks to the time given to them, Henri's little
command had stacked the chamber with an ample supply of food and water, and procured such quantities
of ammunition that they might fire it almost all day long and yet have sufficient for a week,
that a terrific explosion shook the fortress, a huge German shell having burst almost within
it.  The far wall of that hall into which Henri had looked, and which faced the bottom of the
stairs giving access to their chamber, fell in with a crash and clatter, the semi-darkness
existing there being made denser at once by the dust and debris shot out by the explosion.
Then figures raced across the hall, the figures of Frenchmen, coming from some point beyond,
where Jules and his party had failed to discover them, while, quickly following them, could
be seen German infantry--men of the Brandenburg Corps.

"Up here, up here!" shouted Henri, dashing down the stairs at once, and calling to the men
running towards him.  "Here are friends; come up the stairs and join us."

In rapid succession those men dashed through the opening of the hall, leapt up the stairs three
at a time, and were dragged over the parapet which the veteran poilu had had erected.  Then
Henri retreated slowly, and, having rejoined his friends, sat down, rifle in hand, to see what
would happen.

"Tell me," he asked one of the men who had just joined their ranks, and who was gasping for
breath near him, "what has happened?"

"What has happened?  Ah!  They have driven our folks back from the fort, which is now isolated.
We were holding on--I and perhaps a hundred of my comrades--near the eastern end, and then
the Germans, having blasted the corner of the fort to pieces with that last shot, charged from
some trenches in which they were lying, within a hundred metres perhaps, and burst their way
into the place.  We could not hold on any longer.  It was a case of flight, or death, or capture."

"And so you chose flight!  Good!" said Henri.  "We chose the same. Here we are, snug in this
place, with plenty of ammunition, and ready and eager to continue fighting.  If any of you
men understand a machine-gun, get to the one we have, at once, and man it; the rest, who have
no rifles, can assist in any way that appeals to them.  Ah!  Watch those fellows.  They are
streaming into the hall.  There are fifty--more--perhaps a hundred of them."

There were indeed considerably more of the Brandenburgers to be seen when the dust from that
shattered wall had subsided.  They came streaming in to the darkened hall, dishevelled, their
Pickelhaubes gone in many cases, their rifles missing, their grey clothing now a mass of caked
mud, and their hands and faces of the same colour. Shouting and bellowing their triumph, they
massed in the room till an officer made himself apparent.

"Those men?  Those Frenchmen who passed before us?" he asked in the arrogant manner of the
Prussian; "you killed them--eh?"

"No!  They went on ahead of us, up those stairs yonder," one of the men answered.

"Then no doubt they are cut off, like rats in a trap.  Go in and kill them."

Henri turned and whispered to his friends.

"You heard that?" he asked them.  "But perhaps you do not speak German. Then I will translate;
they say they have us here like rats in a trap, and the order has been passed to come and kill
us.  Well, personally, I have a great objection to being killed, and I have every wish indeed
to kill our enemies.  Get ready!  Load!  Two hundred Germans shan't turn us out of these quarters."

"Above, there!" the German officer snapped again.  "Ah!  You will not answer, then; though
I know well enough that Frenchmen are there. Well, let it be so!  But don't say that I have
not warned you.  I give you one minute to come down and surrender--after that, I will blow
you to pieces."

"How very violent!" laughed Jules, and his voice, reaching the ear of that German officer,
sent the blood flushing to his cheeks and his feet stamping with rage.  "How very violent!
'Pon my word, Henri, this fellow needs a lesson, for every time we've listened to him he's
been going to do something desperate--something desperate, that is, to other people.  Shall
we answer the beggar?"

"Yes.  We'll do the square thing.  A moment ago I had a mind to remain quite still and silent,
and let the fellow find out for himself what sort of a place we had got; but we'll be quite
fair with him, and then there can't be any complaints.  Hallo, below there!" he called; "stand
where you are, and don't move forward or one of my men will shoot you. You ask us to surrender,
eh?"

"Ask you!" came the arrogant answer.  "Not at all--I command you!"

"And we take commands only from our own people.  Come and take us," Henri told him delightedly.
"Come and take us, if you can, but I warn you to look out for the consequences."

The man below turned about with that precision to be found in the ranks of the Kaiser's armies,
and strutted back across the hall, his figure lit up by the beams of light entering through
shafts by which the chamber was ventilated.  In less than a minute he had rejoined his men,
and for a while Henri and his friends watched as a consultation was held.  Then, of a sudden,
the men dispersed and were lost to view for quite five minutes.

It was perhaps five minutes later when first one and then, perhaps, a couple of dozen grey-coated
figures slipped into view from behind the tumbled masonry at the far end of the hall, and,
darting to right or to left or down the centre, flopped down behind masses of stone and cement
with which the floor was littered.

"Now keep down," Henri told his friends; "or, better still, keep right away from the barricade,
and report instantly if bullets contrive to penetrate the sacks.  Personally, I don't think
they will, for we've piled them up two deep, and a bag of grain affords tremendous opposition
even to a sharp-pointed bullet.  Ah!  There goes the first! Well, has it gone through?"

"No.  Nor will any others," the veteran told him, with a chuckle.  "We are safe--safer, indeed,
behind these bags, than if we had a stone wall before us.  For, mon garçon, you understand
there will be no ricochetting, no splintering of bullets, no splashes of lead about us."

In a few minutes, as the firing from the hall down below became more general, and thuds on
the outer face of the wall of sacks became almost continuous, it was borne in upon Henri and
his gallant little band that even bullets discharged at such point-blank range had for the
moment little danger for them.

"Then we'll line our wall," said Henri.  "It's not more than twelve feet across, so that six
men lying flat on their faces will be sufficient for the purpose; six more will kneel down
behind them, so as to be ready to fire over the top of the barricade in case of a rush; and
our machine-gun man must squeeze himself into the midst of them. Now, man the loopholes!"

It was a canny suggestion of the bearded veteran which had caused the men assisting him to
build the barricade to leave loopholes for the rifles of the defenders, not only along the
top of this improvised wall, with bags placed so that the heads of those who fired would be
protected, but to leave apertures also just a foot from the bottom through which men lying
flat on their faces might fire down into the hall.  As for the machine-gun, it was piled round
with bags, just the bare tip of the muzzle protruding, and, indeed, thanks to the dusk which
occluded the top of the stairs, giving no indication of its presence to the enemy.  Thus, with
the wall manned, and the remainder of his little party squatting on the stone floor of the
gun-chamber ready to support their comrades, Henri and his men waited for perhaps half an hour,
during which time the fusillade from the men of the 24th Brandenburg Regiment sent a hail of
bullets in their direction.  They thudded against the bags continuously, while often enough
a missile would strike the concrete ceiling of the chamber, and, ricochetting from it, would
mushroom against the opposite wall; some even struck the walls limiting the stairway on either
side, and, breaking off at a tangent and exploding from the impact, scattered strips of nickel
and lead over the heads of the garrison.

"But it is nothing--nothing at all," that bearded veteran told his friends; and, indeed, he
was as good as a reinforcement of a hundred men to them--so gay was he, so full of courage,
so optimistic.  "Poof! Who cares for noise?  Not you, my comrades, who have stood days now
when torrents of German shells were pouring on us, when our ears were deafened by the guns
of either side.  Then who cares for the scream and the hiss of these bullets?  They are but
a drizzle which follows a storm."

"Get ready to support the others!" Henri commanded of a sudden, having crept forward to the
barricade and peered through one of the loopholes. "That officer man is getting impatient,
and, if the truth be known, he is beginning to wonder if any of us are left up here; for, remember,
we have made no answer."

"An easy shot, eh?" Jules told his chum, gripping the rifle which he had thrust through one
of the upper loopholes.  "I could bring him down like a bird, as easy as winking!  But I won't,"
he added of a sudden; "no, for that would hardly be fair fighting."

A whistle sounded down in the hall below, and fifty or more grey-coated figures rushed from
the far end, where, no doubt, they were waiting out of sight and under shelter.  Forming up
across the hall, they were given a sharp order, and almost at once dashed forward.

"They are coming!" Henri called softly to his following.  "Don't show as much as a finger,
if you can help it.  Open fire only when they get to the exit from the hall, and cease fire
immediately you have checked their dash towards us."

Rat-a-tat-tat!  Rat-a-tat-tat!  The machine-gun opened with two short bursts just as the Brandenburgers
reached the foot of the staircase, while the Frenchmen manning the loopholes opened a furious
fire, which first checked the rush of the enemy and then drove the survivors backwards.  Indeed,
in one minute they were all out of sight, and even those who had been sniping at the barricade
had disappeared entirely.

"But it will not be for long; no, my friends," Henri told his party. "That dash is in the form
of a reconnaissance, I expect; though, no doubt, they hardly expected to meet with such resistance."

"Bien!  We shall hear from them again shortly," Jules laughed; while the bearded veteran banged
one broad hand down on his thigh and chuckled loudly.

"Yes, indeed!  Yes, indeed!  We shall hear from them, and they shall hear from us, and our
voices will be as loud as any Prussian's.  But, my Henri, though you are already a commander,
and have won our hearts, yet your inexperience of command has led you to forget one thing which
is essential."

Henri started.  Unconsciously he had been carrying on the work just as he would have done had
he and Stuart and Jules been alone together; that is to say, he had just done his best, and
no one could do more. Then what was it that he had forgotten, this essential point which a
commander of experience would certainly not have omitted?  He gaped at the veteran, who thereupon
laughed and chuckled even more loudly.

"Listen, then, my Henri.  You ask us to fight these Boches, to drive them back, to keep them
out so that we may hold the fort for France and for Grand-père Joffre, and, of a truth, we
would gladly do that.  But listen, then.  Men must eat to fight, and drink also, to retain
their strength; for if men are not strong, how then can they fight as soldiers, my Henri? 
The hour has come for food, and is there not food and drink here in abundance?"

There were smiles all round at that; and presently the little garrison were seated close behind
their barricade, where two men kept watch upon the enemy so that the rest could not be surprised,
while the others ate the rations which forethought had caused them to bring into the fort,
and took cautious draughts from their store of water.  Then, having finished their meal, they
drew cigarettes and pipes from their pockets, and presently a thick cloud of smoke almost hid
the faces of Henri's detachment, and quite a column of it blew out from the aperture through
which the gun, long since removed, had been wont to project its muzzle.

"Begins to look as though they intended to leave us alone, or perhaps they have been driven
out of the fortress," said Jules, tiptoeing along from one of the loopholes.  "There's not
a sound down below, and not a single Prussian has put in an appearance.  Perhaps our fellows
have come up again, eh?  Why not?  And may be already above us and all about us."

"No.  It is not so," called one of the garrison whom Henri had posted at the gun-embrasure,
"for I have been watching here since we came to this chamber.  The French troops have been
driven back on to the plateau--not far, my friends, you will understand, not very far, but
still far enough to take them hopelessly beyond us.  No.  We are cut off here; and if those
Boches have left us alone for a while, and allowed us to enjoy a meal, it is not because they
have forgotten. Maybe they are preparing a new attack; perhaps they have been engaged in consolidating
their position; in any case, we shall hear from them again, and sooner rather than later."

The attack, when it did come, was indeed sudden and unexpected.  A shout came from one of the
men watching at the loopholes; and, darting forward, Henri discerned at once numbers of figures,
which, dashing from the background, were rushing across the hall towards them. Indeed, half
a dozen of the Brandenburgers were already at the exit from the hall, and as he looked through
a loophole they leapt on the first step of the stairway.

"To your places!" he shouted.  "Open fire!  Supports get ready to come forward!"

Bang!  There was the sharp report of a rifle from down below, a sudden piercing cry, and one
of the defenders fell heavily against our hero. An instant later the wall of bags shook while
a German bayonet transfixed one of the upper tier, and tore it from its position.  Then the
machine-gun opened, deafening all within the chamber, lighting by its flash the scene of the
conflict; while the men at the loopholes blazed into the lines of Germans who were now swarming
on the stairway.

That flimsy wall of bags filled with corn shook and swayed as bodies of frantic Germans, slaughtered
by the defenders, fell heavily against it; while one huge Brandenburger who had leapt in advance
of his friends, and who had been caught by a bullet fired from one of the loopholes, fixed
a dying clutch on the summit of the wall, and held on convulsively for a few moments.  Then,
with a piercing scream, he fell backwards, carrying with him some two feet of the top of the
slender defence which Henri and his friends had erected.

"Man the gap," shouted Henri at once, flinging himself towards the opening, and disentangling
himself from another of the defenders who had fallen against him.  "Bring bags up from behind
and fill in the gap while we defend it."

What a pandemonium there was in that comparatively narrow space up which the stone steps ascended,
and across the top of which the barricade of corn-sacks had been erected.  Every step was crammed
with Brandenburgers, while down below, in the gallery along which the miniature railway ran,
which, with its truck, had proved of such service, the exit from the huge hall in the shattered
interior of the fort, and that hall itself, were packed with shouting individuals, with men
pressing forward to the attack, with fallen soldiers, and with wounded who called in shrill
accents to their comrades.  Those at the top of the stairs were bellowing with anger, and some
with fear; for, forced on by the press from behind, and beaten by the opposition of the Frenchmen,
they were, as it were, between two fires, and escape, and even the power of defence, were out
of the question.  They dropped, indeed, as Henri and his friends fired amongst them; while
the bearded veteran, setting a splendid example to his comrades, leapt on to some of the fallen
bags, and, leaning over the swaying wall, made havoc amongst the Germans with his bayonet.
Then of a sudden the shouts died away, there was a rush of steps on the stairway, and silence--a
silence which was almost painful, which seemed to smite the ear of those gallant men holding
the gun embrasure and the chamber.

"It was hot work, my Henri, while it lasted," chuckled the bearded poilu as he wiped the sweat
from his forehead, and stood up after having deposited a fresh bag in its place; "but, mon
Dieu! those Brandenburgers fight like the devil!  And how they hate us; and how we hate them!
Yes, yes!  This is a war to the death!  This is fighting for France!  And only over our bodies
shall they advance towards Paris. Comrades, we are holding them back.  We here in the remains
of this fortress, we are helping to keep the Kaiser's hordes away from the interior of France;
helping, too, to rob him of victory and conquest."

Yes, indeed!  The violent efforts of these men were helping not a little to check the advance
of the enemy, just as the heroic fighting of the French all along the battered trenches round
the salient of Verdun was assisting in defeating the enemy's object.  We have said already
that the conquest and capture of Verdun alone could be of no particular or material benefit
to the Kaiser and his armies.  Verdun was, as it were, merely an empty shell, a sleepy old
town in the hollow by the River Meuse, overshadowed by heights which formed the major portion
of that salient held by our ally.  Forts there were in abundance--forts, as we have said, long
since dismantled.  Yet in Germany the tale spread by the German War Staff, that Verdun was
heavily armed and considered impregnable, was thoroughly believed, just as it was confidently
believed that the valour of the Kaiser's soldiers would snatch it from the enemy.

This terrible World War had come, at this stage, to a period when the spirits of Germans and
Austrians were failing, when some stimulus was sadly needed, and when the courage of the people
was hardly what it had been when the conflict opened.  Who knows?  Who can state with certainty
what was the real object of the German War Staff in launching an attack upon such an impregnable
position--impregnable not because of those dismantled forts and the guns which had once filled
them, but because of the nature of the terrain, those hills with their steep escarpments, and
those positions on the left or western bank of the Meuse which gave such splendid opportunity
to the defenders to outflank with their guns those attacking the northern portion of the salient.
Perhaps a sensational capture of Verdun was the objective of the Germans, merely with the idea
that it would act as a stimulus to the peoples of the Central Empires.  More likely, finding
themselves getting weaker as the months drew on, and terrible losses reduced their fighting
effectives, the Kaiser and his war lords were determined to risk all in one mighty effort--an
effort which should break through the French line at Verdun, thus bringing kudos to the armies
of Prussia, and at the same time demoralizing the French soldiers.  Who knows? They may have
hoped to dash through the gap thus formed, and once more advance on Paris.  In any case, they
were well aware of the phenomenal rise in power of the British forces.  Five million men had
volunteered to fight for king and country; and now, on the top of that, there was news that
Great Britain had adopted conscription; every man up to the age of forty-one was to become
a soldier, was to fight for that liberty dear to all Britons.

Then, seeing that Germany's forces were rapidly dwindling, a blow must be struck now--a sensational
blow--which would, it was hoped, break the power of France before those British reinforcements
could reach her. Later, Germany might still have strength to tackle Britain alone; and in that
case this risky, if determined, attack on Verdun would be worth the price paid for it.

To France then, and the French armies at Verdun, all eyes were turned, for at this moment she
held the fate of the Allies in her hands.  Let her hold on to Verdun, let her defeat the Germans
there by successful resistance, and hold off the enemy till that hour arrived, now fast approaching,
when fresh British forces would have sailed for France, and have taken their place beside the
poilus.  Every little helped; and the fierce encounter taking place beneath the shattered roof
of the fortress of Douaumont was assisting not a little.

"They will come again, later on, perhaps, when it is dark," Henri told his friends, "and we
must make ready to resist them.  Pile up the bags and place them three deep now, for during
the last attack they were nearly pulled over.  After that there's little for us to do but to
wait and smoke.  Of fighting we shall have our full before this little business is ended."

Darkness came on after a while, and presently the gloom within the fortress was so deep that
even the walls lining the stairway were invisible, nor had any of the party any means of illuminating
them, or of lighting up the interior of the hall held by the Brandenburgers. All they could
do was to crouch behind their wall and listen for the attack which they knew must be coming.
Then, of a sudden, there was a violent explosion just outside their wall, and one farther back
in the chamber which they occupied.  Hand-grenades had been thrown by the enemy, and hardly
had the explosions taken place than there was the sound of another charge, and a horde of men
dashed up the stairs and flung themselves upon the barricade which the poilus were defending.

CHAPTER XVI

A Fight to a Finish

A growl came from the man seated at the breech end of the machine-gun:

"Bah!  It is smashed!  That grenade has burst the casing and shaken the whole apparatus.  Give
me a rifle, one of you."

He searched in the darkness for the weapon, and indeed there were enough and to spare now,
for the bomb which had lit in the chamber, and had exploded in that confined space, had damaged
not a few of the defenders.  It had stunned the majority of them, in fact, so that now, as
they manned the barricade, they were half-stupid, more than half-deafened, and hardly knew
what had happened.  Henri and Jules, leaning against the bags and peering out into the darkness,
could see the flash of men's rifles as they fired from below, and caught a glimpse of dusky
figures.  Then they felt the wall wobble, while something struck Henri a blow on the arm, and,
stretching out his hand, he gripped first a pole and then an iron hook at the end of it.  But
it was only one of half a dozen such implements, which German cunning had suggested.  They
were at work then all about him.  Those hooks caught in the upper layer of bags, and at once
they were dragged outwards; Others followed, and even the storm of bullets from the rifles
of the defenders could not stop them.  Indeed, in quite a short space of time the better part
of the barricade on which the defenders had counted had been swept away, dragged down the stairs,
and flung into the passage.

"Bayonets ready!" shouted Henri grimly.  "We have got to cut our way out of this place and
through the Brandenburgers.  Make ready!"

He could feel men swarming up beside him, and heard Jules at his left shouting encouragement
to them.  Then one of the poles armed with an iron hook, failing to catch a bag, became entangled
in his clothing, and in a trice, before he knew where he was, Henri was dragged over the remnants
of the wall, and found himself floundering down the stairway. A minute later, with a loud shout,
the poilus charged over him, making play with their bayonets to right and to left, and driving
the Germans backward.  Then, in that narrow gallery at the foot of the stairway, and at the
wide exit from the hall, there took place as desperate a combat as had ever been in the whole
of this desperate warfare.  Men used their bayonets till the weapons were beaten out of their
hands, or clubbed their rifles and swung them overhead.  Then, undefeated though outnumbered,
they gripped their enemies about the waist and wrestled with them, while some, a few only,
for the art does not come naturally to the poilu, dealt swinging blows with their fists, and,
driving a way through the Germans, escaped into the passage.  It was a mêlée in which all was
confusion, in which shouts deafened the combatants, a pack of struggling, bellowing men, which
seemed as if it would fill the place for ever, and which, as so often happens, suddenly burst
asunder and scattered.

An hour later, when Henri recovered consciousness--for he had been stunned by his fall--he
found himself lying at the foot of the stairway, his legs still resting on the last steps and
his head on the narrow railway.  A man lay across his body--a huge, beefy individual of extraordinary
weight, who pressed him hard against the concrete.  There were other men lying all about him--dead
men, no doubt, for they made no movement--while the stairs themselves, what was left of the
parapet of bags which he and his comrades had erected, and the entrance to the gun  chamber
above, were littered with soldiers, French and German. Strangely enough, though the place had
been sunk in darkness during that last desperate attack, it was now illuminated, not brilliantly,
it is true, but sufficiently for him to be able to make out his surroundings and to discern
objects.

With a desperate effort, Henri contrived to throw off the dead weight which lay across him,
and, raising his head slowly, peered in all directions, feeling dazed and shaken, and as yet
hardly appreciating what had happened.  Then, little by little, he realized the situation,
realized that his band of noble poilus had broken up, that many, indeed, lay dead about him,
and that the rest had scattered, perhaps had been dragged off as prisoners, and perhaps--and
how he hoped it--had gained the open and had made their way back to the French lines.

"Better be careful.  Better be a little cautious," he told himself, beginning to peer over
the broad back of a man who lay beside him. "That's that hall in which the Brandenburgers had
taken up their quarters.  Why, they've a fire burning, and are eating a meal round it. And--and--who's
that?  I've seen that chap before; who is he?"

In his semi-dazed condition he was horribly puzzled, and, shading his eyes with one trembling
hand, peered round the corner of the entrance to that hall at the group occupying its centre.
There were perhaps a hundred Brandenburgers seated in a wide straggling ring round a fire which
blazed in their midst, and which lit up their surroundings and threw long shadows upon what
was left of the concrete walls of the fortress.  The beams from those flickering flames fell
too upon another group--a group, it seemed, of officers--occupying a retired corner, and upon
two solitary individuals who stood near by under the eye of a sentry squatting on a block of
masonry not far from them.  It gave, no doubt, some indication of the strenuous time through
which Henri had passed, and of his stunned condition, that it was quite two minutes before
in one of those figures he recognized Jules--the jovial Jules, sadly dishevelled now, his helmet
gone, his clothing torn, and a blood-stained handkerchief round his forehead.  Yet it was the
old Jules--that cheery, optimistic, unconquerable individual--looking about him with a careless
air and watching the Brandenburgers as they laughed and smoked and chatted as if he would have
gladly joined them.  That, indeed, was one of the characteristics of the gallant Jules; he
could fight like a tiger if need be, though always with a smile on his lips, and, when the
time for fighting had gone, no more friendly individual could have been discovered.  Yes, it
was Jules, a prisoner, and with him another of the poilus who had formed one of Henri's party.

"Wait a moment!  Jules right enough!" said Henri, still inclined to be doubtful; for his limbs
shook, his head wobbled badly, and his eyes were bloodshot and almost incapable of seeing.
"But, who's that other fellow--the chap up in the corner, with his helmet tilted back, that
swaggering beggar who's laying down the law to the officers with him? Jingo!  That man!  Good
Heavens!"

No wonder that he gave vent to such an exclamation, for now, as his shaken brain slowly cleared,
and his eyes, becoming more accustomed to the flickering light, enabled him to see better,
he realized that not only was his old friend a prisoner amongst the Brandenburgers, but that
one of their officers--their commanding officer it seemed--was indeed none other than that
individual whom he had accosted earlier.  The man seemed to be dogging Henri's footsteps. 
For, consider: it was he who had followed the two young Frenchmen and the bulky Stuart along
that tunnel when they were escaping from Ruhleben; it was he again with that party of officers
into whose midst Henri and Jules had stumbled the other evening when out on a reconnaissance;
and, once more, it was he who had demanded the surrender of the garrison manning that gun-chamber.

"Bah!  He again!" growled Henri.  "When lots of other Brandenburgers--better Brandenburgers,
I should say--have been killed by our fire, he is still living, and he's the man who wanted
to shoot us out of hand down in the forest.  Wonder whether he's recognized Jules already?"

He had no need to wonder for very long, for hardly had he made this last discovery when the
officer in question--that arrogant, snappy little individual, who peered about him with an
indefinite something which stamped him as a man of lower caste, one who had gained promotion
from the ranks--rose to his feet, a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, and swaggered towards
the prisoners, his hands thrust deep in his pockets, his head pushed forward, and a truculent,
domineering, brutal air about him.  Halting in front of the two prisoners, he gave them the
benefit of a stare which would have been rude at any time, and which even warfare hardly excused,
and then, without the smallest warning, so swiftly in fact that Henri was staggered, he suddenly
drew one hand out of his pocket and dealt Jules a blow across the jaw with his open hand which
sent that young fellow staggering.

"Ha, ha!  That moved you," the German laughed, turning his head over his shoulder to make sure
that his brother officers had watched the movement.  "That's stirred you up, my friend!  Yes,
my friend--for don't forget we have met before, haven't we?  What, you don't remember? Then
let me tell you: at Ruhleben, my friend, my Frenchman--at Ruhleben, where I happen to remember
very thoroughly the manner in which you treated me.  Do you forget, then?  Do you deny that
it was you who crept through that tunnel, and, breaking a hole through the earth beyond the
entanglements, reached the open; and later, when I followed--having dared the journey along
the tunnel--you and that huge brute of an Englishman--that swine of an Englishman--who was
with you, pulled me up as if I were a puppy and threw me back again, shaking the teeth out
of my head almost?  Burr!"

The little dried-up German officer's eyes flashed vengefully as he spoke of the matter, and
he was all the more incensed an instant later when, rather anticipating some fun--for to the
German comrades of this officer the ill-treatment of a prisoner was certainly fun--these men
drew nearer, and, hearing his words, one of them--a huge, fat, unwieldy person, with flabby
cheeks and pendulous chin, to say nothing of the huge girth which he presented--giggled and
chortled loudly, and suddenly placed a heavy hand on the lieutenant's shoulder--a hand the
weight of which caused him to stagger.

"Drew you out like a puppy, ho?" he shouted.  "Drew our dear Max up out of the earth as a bird
draws a worm; and then had the daring, the effrontery, to dash our immaculate, if not extremely
dignified friend backward till his teeth shook.  Ho!  That's fun!  And how one would like to
see the thing repeated!"

The steely-grey eyes of Lieutenant Max turned towards this hulking German, and shot at him
a glance which was angry and threatening, a glance, however, which failed altogether to impress
the man who had addressed him.  For this hulking officer roared with laughter, and shook to
such an extent that the wreaths of fat on his body wobbled.

"But this is fine!" he shouted, "We have roused the lion in our little Max, and he is angry--angry
with me, mark you, my friends--because I would like to see repeated something which no doubt
was most entertaining.  But, surely, Max, you were not defeated by this fellow, this puny Frenchman?"

The big German ran a pair of critical eyes over the dishevelled figure of Jules, standing helpless
before him, eyes which nevertheless did not fail to note the determined look of this young
man, his unflinching attitude, and the gleam of anger which came from behind his eyes, and
which threatened retaliation.  Yes, at that very moment the impetuous Jules, stung by the blow
which Max had dealt him, and understanding every word that passed, was on the eve of throwing
himself upon the German; and then, as he glanced from one to the other, and helplessly round
the hall at the backs of the Brandenburgers--indifferent to what befel their prisoners--to
the exit from that hall and the stairway beyond it, at the summit of which he and Henri and
those other comrades had put up such a fight, his wandering eyes lit upon the figures of Germans
and Frenchmen--the fallen men who had grappled at the foot of the stairs--and, passing from
one to another, came upon a face, an eager face, wherein two eyes were set--eyes which were
staring hard in his direction.  The face moved, while the owner of it sat up a little and held
up a warning finger.

"Henri!" exclaimed Jules, and at once took command of himself, and pulled his somewhat shaken
frame up at attention.

"What's that?" demanded the big German abruptly.  "See, Max, he is defying you, this fellow.
And you say that he drew you out of the earth and threw you back, almost shaking the teeth
out of your head? Unbelievable!  Yet, if it is true, why, no Brandenburger will sit still under
such an insult."

The jeering laughter of this giant, the covert smiles and the outspoken remarks of other German
officers, sent the blood flaring again to Max's cheeks.  He scowled, first at one and then
at others of his comrades; and, turning once more to the prisoner, and catching at that moment
a gleam of defiance from his eyes, struck out again with one hand and almost floored the unfortunate
and helpless Jules.

"That to commence with," he told him, "and then to finish the matter. I don't forget, mind
you, the blow that you landed on my body in that forest the other night.  No, believe me, I,
Max, forget nothing of that sort.  Then I would have had you shot out of hand, though the occasion
was not convenient; but now there is no reason why the execution should not be carried out.
You are an escaped prisoner of war; you have assaulted a German officer in the execution of
his duty; and here you are, captured, defying the captors of the Fort of Douaumont.  March
him to the far end of the hall, and call out half a dozen of those guzzling fellows to shoot him."

The armed sentry, who had stood by all this while, taking but little notice of the scene, looking
tired and bored and as if he longed to join his comrades, pulled himself together, and, shouldering
his rifle, gave a husky order.

"Over there!" he called.  "Stand up against the wall!  Sergeant Huefer, the officer requires
a shooting-party."

The selfsame Sergeant Huefer, at that moment engaged in finishing a hasty meal, looked round
and scowled; and then, seeing the snappy little German officer, called Max, looking at him,
stood up promptly.

"A shooting-party, sir?" he asked.

"A shooting-party," came the abrupt answer.  "Draw them up in front of those two prisoners."

"Two!" exclaimed the big German officer, who with the others was watching the scene.

"Yes, two," snapped Max, swinging round upon him, ready to vent his anger on any one of them.

"But wait!  Not two; one only--the escaped prisoner of war, who struck you."

The big German and this snappy little fellow, Max, stared at one another, the former looking
urbane and jovial and unconcerned, whilst Max was trembling with rage.  He could have kicked
this big German who ventured to obstruct him, and who seemed about to thwart his purpose. Yet
Max was a careful individual, who had indeed worked his way upwards in the German army, and
obtained slow if certain promotion, by constant observation of the regulations.  The shooting
of captured Frenchmen was one thing--a common enough thing no doubt--but disobedience, defiance
of a senior officer, was an altogether different matter, and this big, hulking German happened
to be Max's senior by a very slender margin. So slender, indeed, that the position was almost
doubtful.  Indeed, at that moment neither Max nor this big German could say which of the two
was the senior in rank, and entitled to command this party, though it happened that the bigger
of the two was not a Brandenburger, but belonging to some other corps, who had by chance fallen
in with the party told off to attack the fort of Douaumont, and so found himself amidst its
captors.  For a moment, then, the two regarded one another, Max flaming with anger, defiant,
on the point of abruptly ordering this hulking individual to mind his own business.  And then
that sense of discretion which had helped him in the past came to his assistance, and he forced
a smile--an unwilling smile--while his eyes flashed a vengeful glance at his opponent.

"Then you object?" he asked sharply.  "Well, then, let it be one--the prisoner of war.  We
will shoot him, and get it over quickly. Sergeant, march the firing-party forward, I will give
the word to shoot."

Still shaken, his head swimming yet after that struggle on the stairway, his bloodshot eyes
fixed upon the figures of Jules, of the officers, and of Sergeant Huefer and the party of men
he was now parading, Henri never felt more helpless in all his life before.  He felt pinned
to the spot, incapable of action; and, indeed, common sense--what little of it he still possessed
after the blow which had rendered him unconscious--told him that action of any sort was useless.
Yet, could he see a friend, an old chum, a comrade as dear to him as any brother, shot down
in cold blood in front of these leering men? Could he watch him put up as a target, to be butchered
by these unfeeling Germans?  No.  The thought that Jules's fate hung heavily in the balance,
that some desperate action on his part might bring him assistance, spurred Henri to movement,
and, rising to his knees, he groped his way towards the entrance to the hall wherein the firing-party
were then assembling.  As he crawled across the bodies then littering the gallery along which
the tiny railway ran, and crossed the foot of the stairway, his hand lit upon a rifle, which
he seized instantly and raised to his shoulder.  Then he dropped it again, for the movement
was too much for him, and, stumbling forward, fell on his face, his head swimming once more,
his brain in a whirl, and his pulses beating in his ears till he was deafened.  It was just
at the moment when Sergeant Huefer, undisturbed by the task allotted to him, in fact, eager
to finish off the prisoner and get back to his meal, gave a short, sharp order and set his
firing-squad in motion, that Henri's outstretched fingers came into contact with another object--a
round, cylindrical object attached to a short stick, a hand-grenade, one of those bombs which
had helped to blow in the barricade which he and his gallant poilus had erected at the top
of the stairway.

With an effort he pulled himself together, and, gripping the stick, felt for the safety-pin,
removal of which would allow explosion of the grenade once it came into contact with any body.
Then, rising to his knees, and unsteadily to his feet, he stretched out his left hand to the
wall, while with his right he swung the hand-grenade backwards and forwards.  By then the firing-party
had been halted in front of Jules, who, head in air and arms folded, stood against the far wall.

"Load!" he heard the command ring out and echo down the gallery. "Present!"

Up went the rifles to the shoulders.

Henri gave a sharp jerk to the handle of the grenade as he loosened his hold of it, and sent
it flying forward into the hall, where it landed a moment later--landed, indeed, within a foot
of the fire which the men had built in the centre of this big place, and about which they had
been seated.  There followed a blinding flash, a thundering detonation, and then shouts and
shrieks and groans, and clouds of dust and falling debris.  An instant later, Henri had fallen
backward into the gallery, and lay, much as he had lain before, among the bodies of those who
had taken part in the fight on the stairway.

CHAPTER XVII

Charge of the Gallant Bretons

Let us for the moment leave Henri and Jules in the centre of the ruins of Fort Douaumont, and
return for a few brief seconds to that gallant yet dangerously small force of Frenchmen, who,
until this moment, had been fighting to check the advance of the Germans about the town of Verdun.

Five days of the most terrific fighting had passed.  Five days of incessant bombardment from
massed German guns, which had literally blown the defenders out of their trenches.  And during
those few days, when the French lines to the north of the salient and to the east of the River
Meuse were driven in till they rested near Vacherauville, on the Meuse, and ran from thence
to Thiaumont and Douaumont Fort and Vaux, and so back to the Meuse again, French efforts had
not been confined alone to local fighting.

On the very first day, indeed, what had been strongly suspected before became abundantly apparent,
and it was clear that a German attack of unprecedented force and violence on the salient of
Verdun was to be expected.  The weight of artillery alone which for all those hours had been
pouring a torrent of shells on the heights of the Meuse was sufficient to indicate the nature
of the German preparations.  A thousand guns, directing their missiles on one sector of the
long line of trenches wriggling across the north-eastern provinces of France, was no unusual
feature of this extraordinary and gigantic warfare, but here there were not one thousand guns
alone but many more, many hundreds more, probably even in excess of two thousand; while, moreover,
the troops of the Kaiser, debouching from the woods, marching up those ravines giving access
to the plateau of Douaumont, and massing behind evergreen firs farther away, as discerned by
the air-pilots of our ally, disclosed the fact that those massed guns were to be supported
by an equally enormous concentration of troops--a concentration which could have been effected
only for one purpose.  In short, and in fact, it was clear that this was to be no ordinary
attack on the salient of Verdun, but a gigantic offensive--one which would demand a numerous
defending force and guns in proportion.

But the movement of troops from one area of the field to another is a comparatively slow process
at the best of times, for it must be remembered that, behind the fighting-lines of such an
army as opposed the Germans, rails are always more or less congested, while an enormous mass
of vehicles ply the roads, bringing up ammunition and food, and hundreds of other articles
necessary for the fighters.  Time, then, was required in which to gather French forces, and
time in which to rush them over the rails, and by motor-transport along the roads, to the neighbourhood
of Verdun, and then to push them up to the fighting-line.

Those gallant fellows who had faced the first rush of the Germans, who had stood under a tornado
of shells, and who had held on to their positions so desperately, were fighting all the while,
not so much to hold the particular positions in which they were, as to gain time, to resist
as long as possible, to thwart the enemy in his intentions, to delay his advance, and to keep
him away from the main line of defence till such time as reinforcements could reach them. 
Very gallantly had the thin line of heroes carried out their purpose, holding on, often enough,
till they were killed to the last man.  They had made the Kaiser's troops pay dearly for every
inch of ground; and, whereas the German High Command had confidently expected to reach Verdun
within a day or two, five days had passed, and yet, in spite of overwhelming gun-fire and masses
of troops, the French had only just retired to their main defensive position.

Douaumont stood on that line.  Douaumont, which the Kaiser had told his people was the corner-stone
of the salient which he hoped to capture; and Douaumont, as we know, had fallen already to
the Brandenburgers. Yet behind Douaumont, behind the Côte du Poivre and the Côte de Talou,
there existed yet miles of upland plateau before the city of Verdun could be reached--miles
which the Germans must cross before they could hope to complete its capture.

We have seen how, attempting to follow up their drive to the north, the French guns on Mort
Homme and Hill 304 had outflanked the Germans, and had driven them from the Côte de Talou and
the Côte du Poivre.  We have followed their movements later, when, abandoning the drive in
a southerly direction over the slopes of the Côte du Poivre, the German war lords caused their
armies to swerve to the east to face the fort of Douaumont and to march towards it.  Let us
anticipate their movements by a little, and say that, having captured the fort--a mere empty
and cracked vessel--they found themselves still faced by the French, who had retired only a
short distance beyond it; and who, reinforced that very night by the 20th Corps--as dashing
a corps as ever existed--counter-attacked with furious energy, and advanced their lines till
they surrounded the captured fort on three sides, and held, indeed, a portion of the interior.
There, in that position, they dug themselves in firmly, and though the Germans continued to
attack that portion of the line with a fury never before exceeded, and with utter disregard
of the losses they suffered, not for weeks did they so much as dent it.  Like the Côte de Talou,
and the approaches from the north, Douaumont and the neighbouring trenches defied them; and,
tiring, as it were, of the venture in that direction, yet determined as ever to capture Verdun
and the salient, they once more changed their line of attack.  Crossing the Meuse, they flung
their details against the Mort Homme and Hill 304, hoping to capture those positions and sweep
away the guns which enfiladed the Côte du Poivre.  The removal of these would allow them to
continue that advance from the north which threatened to shorten the base of the salient and
to capture its defenders.

If we were to venture to describe every attack made by the Germans, every gallant defence of
the French poilus, and the course in detail of the terrific conflict which raged--and, indeed,
still rages as we write--round the salient of Verdun, we should require a multiplicity of chapters.
For, indeed, foiled at the outset by the failure of their giant attack to do more than drive
the French on to their main positions, in spite of the huge advantage of a surprise effected
on the 21st February, and forced, as it were, by public opinion--the opinion of Germans at
home, of their Austrian allies, and of every neutral country in the world--the Kaiser's war
lords kept desperately at the task of subduing the salient.  Not one, but dozens of assaults
were made either upon the Mort Homme and Hill 304 positions, or upon the plateau of Douaumont,
extending at times to the farm of Thiaumont, and later, after weeks and weeks of conflict,
to the fort of Vaux and the trenches south of it.  The most gigantic attack on any one position
that has ever been recorded in the history of the world was accompanied by other facts hitherto
never seen in warfare.

The hosts of German troops concentrated on the face of the salient approached at times three-quarters
of a million, and needed constant replenishment; for French 75's, machine-gun and rifle-fire
bit deep into the ranks, and soldiers--hundreds of them, nay, thousands--fell, till the slopes
leading to Mort Homme and to the gentle wooded heights of the Meuse became a mere shambles.
Four months of fighting, indeed, found General Joffre and his brave troops still holding the
line, still selling inches of the hills when the pressure became too great or the enemy gun-fire
too fierce to be withstood--selling those inches at a price which can only be termed grisly
and exorbitant--and now and again counter-attacking, when pressure from the enemy had forced
them to yield ground of vital value.

Yes, after four months of terrific fighting, Verdun, that sleepy old town down by the River
Meuse, and the lines of trenches surrounding it which formed that historic salient of which
we have written, were still in the hands of the French, still denied the Germans; while the
losses inflicted upon the latter, the increasing pressure of the British, now in crowded ranks
along the Western Front--so crowded, indeed, that already a fourth army had taken over lines
from the French, thus yielding reserves for further fighting at Verdun--that increasing pressure
and a sudden brilliantly successful offensive on the part of the Russians in Galicia were putting
the Kaiser and his war lords in a sad predicament.  They, too, needed reserves: reserves to
feed those horrible gaps at Verdun; reserves to march against the British Front; reserves to
rail to Russia, there, if it were possible, to stem the tide of Muscovite troops pouring through
the broken Austrian lines on their way to Vienna and Berlin.

Let us leave the combatants there to return to Jules and Henri. Pandemonium reigned in that
huge battered hall of the fort of Douaumont when the bomb which Henry had thrown had done its
work in the midst of the Germans.  The fire hitherto burning so cheerfully in the centre of
the darkened hall was scattered in every quarter, leaving glowing embers in odd corners and
crannies.  Had there been more light upon the surroundings, many of the men, seated but a moment
or so before, would have been seen stretched on the ground, killed by the explosion.  That
big officer, who, still chuckling, had looked on at the preparations for Jules's execution,
might have been seen leaning against the outer wall of the fort, his tunic torn and burned,
a red pool collecting on the flags beside him, his jaw dropped, his eyes wide open, insensible
and dying.  And of Max, that little snappy officer, not a sign would have been found.  For,
like every surviving man who had stood in the hall, he had bolted.  A hand gripped Jules suddenly,
as he lay gasping against the wall.

"Who's that?" he demanded breathlessly.  "Hands off, or I'll choke you," and, shaken though
he was by the explosion, he prepared to throw himself upon the individual who had accosted him.

"Jules, is that you, Jules?" came a feeble voice, and almost at the same moment a heavy form
flopped down beside him and straightway rolled across him.

It was Henri, as unconscious at that instant as was the big German, chuckling but a minute earlier.

"Henri!" Jules shouted; "Henri, what's happened?  Are you killed like the rest of them?"

Evidently the gallant Henri was nothing of the sort, for, opening his eyes and staring out
into the darkness, he growled a denial.

"Dead?  Not much!  but soon shall be if we stay here long enough for those fellows to bring
lights," he grumbled.  "If they bring lights they'll get us, and then----"

"You needn't mention the rest of the details.  Pull yourself together!" Jules told him.  "Here,
wait a moment!"

Freeing himself from the dead weight of his chum, he dashed across the hall, feeling giddy
and shaken by the explosion, and, scrambling on hands and knees amongst the bodies lying around
the spot where the fire had been burning, he soon secured a water-bottle, and, hastening back,
first dashed some of the contents into Henri's face, and then lifted the metal cup to his lips
and let him drain it.

"Wanted that--eh?" he asked, having himself gulped down a draught. "Let's have another.  Now,
here we are!  My word, what a bust-up!  How did it happen?  I saw you over there, just outside
the hall, and wondered whether you'd do anything.  You did--eh?  Was that your bomb? Tell me
about it."

Henri scoffed at him--scoffed angrily.

"Let's take a seat in the very centre, search for food, and sit down to a leisurely dinner,"
he said, his voice choked with satire.  "Better still, let's ring a bell, if there's one, and
ask that Max individual to come in and join us; he'd enjoy it, wouldn't he?"

"The demon!  He'd have shot me in another minute.  But still, here we are!"

"And the sooner we get out of it the better.  That water's made me feel far better, and I can
stand now, I believe.  Yes, giddy a bit, but I can still stick to my pins, and that's something.
What do we do--eh? Here, pull off the uniforms of a couple of these fellows, they'll not miss
them, and let's change clothes as quickly as we can.  Don't forget, too, that once we've changed
we are Germans--Brandenburgers, 6th Brigade fellows, who've attacked the fort and helped to
capture it. No more French after we've got into our disguises."

The suggestion came glibly enough, and sounded extremely simple; yet when the two--shaken after
that terrific fight on the stairway, and once again by the explosion which Henri had manoeuvred--came
to attempt the task they found it almost beyond them, for your German, as a general rule, is
of no mean stature.  Even in days when rations may be reduced owing to the British blockade,
which holds up supplies destined for the German Empire, German recruits are still plump and
fat, and Brandenburgers not less so than their fellows.  Thus the task of turning dead men
over and filching their garments, hard enough in any case, was made more difficult in the darkness,
particularly so for young fellows such as Jules and Henri, who were not stoutly built like
the Germans.

"Slip on any sort of an old coat and helmet at first," Henri advised, "then if that Max comes
back we can push our way in amongst the bodies of the fallen, and he'll be none the wiser.
Later, when we have the opportunity, we can make a more leisurely search, and perhaps we shall
be lucky in finding garments that fit us."

It was a fortunate thing, indeed, that they decided on such a plan. For as they went about
the hall, stooping over the bodies of the fallen, endeavouring to select and discover clothes
likely to suit their own stature, a loud order was heard from behind the battered end of the
hall, and presently some twenty men inarched in, the short and snappy officer leading them.

"Pull out the fellows who are still alive, or not too seriously injured," he commanded.  "Leave
the dead till later on.  Now hurry!"

Parties of stretcher-bearers followed the soldiers, and, starting at once, began to bend over
the fallen forms lying about the hall, turning men over, dragging the dead aside, and lifting
those who were wounded out of the mass.  Coming to a distant corner, not so far indeed from
the exit leading to the stairway which Jules and Henri had defended, a party of bearers discovered
a pack of Germans lying in all directions, their limbs stretched in the most fantastic postures,
some on their sides, their heads resting on an arm as if they were sleeping; others on their
faces, their arms doubled up beneath them; and others, again, on their backs, stiff and stark
already.

"Dead!" said the commander of the party, a junior non-commissioned officer.  "On one side with
him!"

"Dead!" repeated one of the bearers, leaning over another figure. "Here, he's not a big man,
I can manage him single-handed."

"As dead as any," cried a third, and seemed quite jovial about it. "Here we are!  He's no weight
at all--quite a puny fellow for a Brandenburger."

They dragged perhaps half a dozen bodies away from the corner to the far wall, and laid them
in a row beside others already collected; then, gathering up the wounded and carrying them
outside, they returned again, completing their task after some few minutes.

"Light up!" Max, that short and snappy German officer, commanded.  "Get a fire going, and let
us resume the meal.  One moment though!  Have any of you seen a sign of those Frenchmen--the
two whom we were about to shoot?"

"One there, sir," came the answer, while a bearer holding a torch lit up that part of the hall
by the wall against which Jules and his fellow-prisoner had been stationed.  "He's dead--a
piece of masonry, dislodged by the explosion, fell on him."

Max seized the torch from the man, and, striding forward, bent over the figure of the poilu,
and, turning the body with his foot--for this German was an individual possessed of little
feeling, indeed a heartless wretch, a callous fellow--he placed the torch nearer, and stared
at the face of the Frenchman.

"Burr!  Not my man!  And no one has seen the other?"

"No one!"

"Then we will wait till morning and search the place.  Now, let the men turn to at their meal.
Sergeant, wake me in an hour's time, when I will go round and inspect the sentries."

Gradually the fire in the centre of the hall died down, while men nodded as they sat on blocks
of fallen masonry, or on forms which had been dragged into the hall.  Darkness slowly penetrated
to every corner of the place and almost hid the Germans.  Then a figure stirred, one of the
dead sat up slowly and nudged another of the dead beside him.  One of the nodding figures seated
upon a form on the far side of the fire yawned, stretching his arms widely, kicked the ashes
from the dying embers with a heavy boot, and looked about him.  Then his hair rose on his head,
while his eyes protruded in the most horrible manner. Perspiration dropped from his forehead,
his hands shook, and his limbs trembled, as he gaped at those two dead figures sitting up and
regarding him closely.

"Dead men sit up and look at me!  Dead men!" he spluttered, and slowly rose to his feet.

There was a frozen look on the wretch's face now, and he kept his eyes on those two figures
as if he had no power to turn them away, as if, like a serpent, they fascinated him.  Then
of a sudden he gave vent to a loud scream and dashed from the hall, upsetting his comrades
as he did so.

"Down!  Dead men again!  Lower!  What a business!" groaned Jules as he flopped himself on to
the flags once more, his face turned towards Henri.

"S--s--sh!  Shut up!  They are all on their feet again.  Confound that fellow!  It was bad
luck his suddenly looking up and finding us sitting here staring at him.  We've got to move,"
whispered Henri.

"Soon too," Jules told him, "precious soon.  My, isn't that Max in a rage, and aren't the lot
of them bothered!"

Yet not so bothered that the noise which followed that piercing scream did not subside quickly.
After all, screams were not unusual in those days of strenuous combat, when Germans were driven
to the assault, time and again, and death and destruction were so near them--that terrible
shell-fire which smote them from the missiles of the French 75's, the raking hail of bullets
from machine-guns, the detonation of exploding missiles, the roar, the crash, the smoke, the
ever-present danger.  All had told on the nerves, not of one man here and there, but on hundreds
of the Kaiser's soldiers.  Men went mad in those days of attack on Douaumont, just as they
went mad in the onslaught at Ypres in October, 1914; just, indeed, as they had lost their reason
during other terrible periods.  Yes, your German war lord is no sympathetic commander. Losses,
frightful losses, do not frighten or trouble him so long as he is reasonably sure of obtaining
his objective.

And German losses had been frightful enough in all conscience since the war started.  Those
losses were telling upon the German ranks now--had been telling for a considerable period--and
were likely in the months coming, towards the end of 1916, to tell so severely, that it might
be beyond the power of the Central Empires to hold their lines any longer. Yes, men went mad
often enough, and no doubt the man in question was another such unfortunate individual.

"Confound him!" growled Max.  "Why didn't he get shot as we came to the fort, or in the attack
on that stairway?  What's he want to disturb our rest for when we want every minute of rest
we can get? for soon those Frenchmen will be returning.  Turn in again, you men.  We'll search
for that rascal in the morning."

But would they?  For listen: as the night grew older, as darkness became denser above the shattered
fort of Douaumont, and the fire died down so that the Brandenburgers holding that central hall
were no longer visible, figures began to collect behind the French trenches--the active, eager
figures of gallant Bretons of the 20th Corps, a crack corps, to whom the task had been assigned
of recapturing the fortress.  A gun opened far behind, a rocket soared, and then a wave of
figures poured over the parapet of the trenches and ten thousand shouting, furious Frenchmen
streamed down upon the debris of Douaumont--that "corner-stone" of the defences of the salient,
of the capture of which the Kaiser had boasted so loudly.

"What's that?  French shouts!  French bugles!  A counter-attack!  Get up," Henri whispered
in Jules's ear.  "We've got to take our chance to join them'."

CHAPTER XVIII

A Sinister German

What a sight that 20th French Corps--those noble Bretons--would have presented had it been
daylight when they leapt from their trenches and advanced in one stupendous rush upon the captured
fort of Douaumont! Filled with élan, determined to throw the invader backward, stung by the
loss of trenches which had been French but a little while before, and eager beyond all words
to bring assistance to that gallant yet sadly-thinned line which had staved off the Kaiser's
hordes, this 20th Corps--the first of the reserves which General Petain had been able to rush
to the scene of action--hurled itself impetuously at the Germans. Star-shells burst into flame
overhead, showing dashing poilus, flickered from the tips of bayonets and lit up the smoke
from exploding shells, where a canopy of it hung about the devoted heads of that gallant corps.
In the darkness, in the fitful light cast by those shells, now and again augmented by the flashing
beams of an electric search-light, a desperate hand-to-hand conflict took place.

The line of Bretons was halted for a few moments as it met the Germans, it wavered, perhaps,
here and there just a trifle, and then it swept on as a flood sweeps down a road, washing the
debris of the 6th Brigade of the Brandenburg Corps before it, submerging hundreds, and trampling
not a few into the mud and into the pit-holes and craters dug everywhere by German shells.

"They come!  A counter-attack!  Prepare to receive the enemy!"

It was Max, that snappy little German officer, who gave the command and called his men about him.

"Man every loophole!  And hold on at whatever cost!  You--you are fit to fight," he suddenly
snapped, turning upon one of the wounded wretches who had suffered from that explosion caused
by the bomb tossed by Henri.  "You are skulking, my friend.  Up!  Seize a rifle!  Get to your
loophole!"

The man staggered.  His eyes were bloodshot, his clothing torn and tattered after the explosion,
with one arm swinging loose in its sleeve.  He looked at this peremptory officer in dazed fashion.
Indeed, like Henri and Jules, he had been more than half stunned, and his wits were still wool-gathering.

"Seize a rifle!  Go to a loophole, eh?" he ejaculated.

"Fool!  Yes!  Fight--fight for your life; fight for your Fatherland!" Max shouted at him. 
"Here--here's a rifle," he went on, tearing one from beneath the body of a fallen soldier,
and handing it to him.  "Now off with you, at once!"

"At once?  Fight at once?" the man stammered, while those who watched, even in that fitful
light--for the fire built by the officer in the far corner was still burning--noticed that
a dribble of blood was oozing from the corner of his lips, "but, sir----" he began.

"No 'buts'!" bellowed Max at him; "to your duty!"

The man gripped weakly at the rifle, turned obediently to carry out the order, and then, staggering
a pace or two, fell full length on the floor.

"Bah!  A bad choice then!  Well, one makes mistakes," Max said, a grim smile on his face. 
"But you," he called, selecting another individual seated on the ground, his back resting against
the wall--a man whose pallid face told that he was suffering--"you get up and go about your duty."

As if determined that there should be no error and no backsliding, no hesitation in this case,
he applied his boot to the unfortunate individual, and drove him from his position.  "Now,
you, and you, and you!  About your business!  Get to your duty!"

Henri and Jules came in for his attentions, for they had crept away from that hideous row of
dead, and both gaped at him for a while in open-mouthed amazement, wondering, indeed, whether
they were discovered, wondering in a half-bewildered sort of way what they ought to do.  For
still Henri's ears buzzed, and still his brain reeled; not so much from the explosion--for
the wall separating the hall from the corridor outside had sheltered him not a little, but
reeling from the effects of his tumble downstairs and the mad mêlée which had taken place there.
As for Jules, the fellow was quite light-headed, for the bomb had sent him backward against
the wall with a crash, and he too had taken his share in that desperate fight at the top of
the stairway. He began to giggle, which was a way Jules had, and Max, happening to catch sight
of him at the moment, and stung to fury by such mirth on the part of one of his men, by such
a sign of insubordination, smote him across the face, little realizing that the one he struck
was the same man, that very prisoner, whom he had struck not so long before, and whom he would
willingly have executed.

"Come along!" Henri managed to whisper to his chum.  "Better to be taken for Germans than to
be discovered in our disguises.  Let's get hold of rifles and take our post at some loophole.
Those were French shouts we heard, and it may be that we shall have an opportunity of joining
our people."

"And in any case one needn't fire into our fellows," responded Jules, his face still smarting
from the blow that Max had dealt him.  "But listen, Henri; if I get a chance I'll kill that
fellow.  Better still, if I get a chance I'll capture the brute, and carry him back to our
lines, where he can be tried for offering violence to prisoners. Crikey!  How wobbly a fellow
feels!  My feet are too big and too clumsy for anything."

It was a sorry band which obeyed the peremptory order of the bullying German.  Men staggered
across the littered floor of that hall, steering their way between fallen blocks of masonry
and wounded men damaged by the explosion of Henri's making.  Passing through the exit, they
clambered over the bodies of the fallen Germans who lay thickly at the foot of the stairway,
and across the bodies, too, of many a gallant Frenchman.  Then, directed by the bullying Max,
they climbed the stairway or went along the gallery, and presently were manning the embrasures
through which the guns of the fortress of Douaumont--when it was indeed a fortress--commanded
the surrounding country.  Flashes could be seen through those embrasures--flashes close at
hand, and others farther distant--while the air was torn and rent by the crash of distant guns,
by the detonation of exploding shells, and by the sharp snap and rattle of musketry.  There
were yells, too--shouts of terror from the Brandenburgers, now being driven back towards the
fortress, and the bellows of excited and triumphant men wresting ground from them.

"Keep an eye round you," Henri told Jules, for the two were posted at one embrasure, and no
one else was in the chamber.  "What's to prevent a fellow lowering himself from this point
and joining our fellows?  A rope is what is wanted, but it's a plaguey thing to find in such
a place and at such a moment.  Hold on here, Jules, while I go skirmishing."

Staggering away from his comrade, Henri reached the head of the stairway and clambered down
it, leaning against the side wall with both hands, for his feet were terribly uncertain.  Then,
reaching the gallery below, he turned along it, and in a little while, was within easy reach
of the hall in which he and Jules had been lying, when suddenly the noise outside increased.
There was a rush of steps somewhere near at hand, a crashing explosion as a bomb was thrown
through an embrasure somewhere beyond him, and then a torrent of figures poured into the place--a
torrent of gesticulating, shouting Frenchmen, of gallant Bretons, who had won their way to
the western edge of the fortress.  Lamps appeared, and flaring torches too were brought in
by the soldiers, who at once proceeded to search that part of Douaumont.

In a dream, as it were, shaken by what he had gone through, and overcome somewhat by the sight
and sound of friends, Henri had tumbled to the floor again, as he heard an officer give vent
to a sharp order.

"Drive the fellows on before you as far as you can," he shouted, "then build up barricades
across every corridor and gallery, and hold them off till we can get more men in here and drive
them out of the fortress altogether.  Bomb them, mes enfants!  Blow them out of the place!
Douaumont belongs to France, and not to the Kaiser."

Yes, in a dream, Henri heard the words, and tried to raise his shaken figure, tried his utmost
to join them; and in a dream, too, he watched the Bretons as they moved rapidly about and obeyed
those orders.  It was perhaps a quarter of an hour later, perhaps only a few minutes, but more
likely half an hour after their first appearance, that, still in the same hazy sort of way,
still somewhat in dreamland, his head whirling and his ears singing, Henri became aware of
a strange fact, a fact, however, which hardly struck him as peculiar at that moment, that a
man not far from him--one of those corpses stretched in the gallery and illuminated by a torch
thrust into a crevice of the masonry not far away--was moving, was lifting his head craftily,
was creeping along over other bodies, and was peering round corners and watching the Bretons.

"Strange!" thought Henri.  "What on earth can the fellow be doing? And--Christopher!  He's
not a Frenchman!"

That indeed was a peculiar thing; and, still in the same dazed sort of way, Henri watched and
wondered.

"Not a Frenchman," he was telling himself, "then a German, and I don't know--yes, I do believe
I know--the figure.  Small, eh?  Dressed in field-grey, yet not the usual sort of uniform.
Who is he?  What is the fellow?  Well, I never!"

In ordinary times Henri would have made up his mind in an instant, would have acted promptly,
and would have taken in the situation without a moment's hesitation.  But now, what with that
horrible feeling of nausea which assailed him, what with his miserable brain, which reeled
and buzzed and whirled, making vision almost impossible and hearing almost out of the question,
he could not, try as he would, collect his scattered wits.  Indeed, he had no energy left with
which to make any sort of an effort; he just gaped, smiled, and certainly grimaced at that
crawling figure.  He knew he was an enemy, knew that the man he watched boded no good to his
comrades, and knew also that the fellow represented some subtle form of danger.  Yet he could
not move, could do no more than gape and grin and grimace, and could not properly realize the
meaning of the situation.  Then suddenly he started, for another crawling figure came from
behind him, and a hand gripped his hand sharply.

"You, Henri!  You here!  And did not return!  Why, you're sick!  You're half stunned still!"

It was Jules, who, finding that his chum did not return, had descended to the gallery to find
him, and, coming upon him stretched there amongst the dead, noticed, with the help of a flickering
torch, that Henri's head hung, that perspiration dropped from his forehead, and that his face
was deadly white and pallid.  Yet his coming seemed suddenly to rouse Henri; for the latter's
drooping eyelids opened widely at once, a frown crossed his forehead, and in a moment he had
seized Jules's hand, and, tugging it, indicated that he was to lie down beside him.

"S--s--h!"

"What's up?" demanded Jules hoarsely.

"Down!" whispered Henri; for at that moment the figure he had been watching, and which had
stretched itself flat like one of the dead, doubtless because a Frenchman was approaching,
had now begun to rise stealthily.  "Look!" he whispered, pointing, and then watched Jules's
face as the latter fixed his eyes upon that figure.

Henri noticed at once--and it was remarkable how his wits were assembling now that Jules had
stimulated them--that Jules's eyes started, that an intent look came into them promptly, while
something approaching a scowl gathered on his features.

"That man!" he heard him exclaim, and then watched as his friend flopped down amongst the dead
and lay as close as possible.  Then together the two watched as that German crept on still
farther.  A minute later and he had turned where the gallery swept round the corner of the
fort abruptly and proceeded in another direction.  Following promptly, creeping across the
bodies of the fallen, or finding their way between them when they could--for it was not exactly
nice to kneel upon the forms of men who, to whatever side they had belonged, had died fighting--Henri
and Jules too turned that corner, only to find themselves now in almost complete darkness,
with no light to guide them, with not a sound to tell them of the whereabouts of that sinister
German, and nothing to indicate his presence.

"Stop!  Let's wait and listen."

Henri's hand went out and gripped Jules's sleeve, while the two came to a halt at once, sitting
up on their haunches, as it were, and peered into the darkness and listened--peered till Henri's
bloodshot eyes positively ached, until tears of weakness dribbled down his face and splashed
on to the pavement.  As for his head, it throbbed as if a giant hammer were within it, and
some demon were rattling the interior of his skull and were dancing a tattoo upon his ear-drums.

"Bah!"  He felt that old nausea, and felt horribly giddy, and was forced to stretch his hands
forward and lean upon them to support his weight, while everything went round and round, and,
strangely enough, instead of darkness surrounding him, a thousand flashes appeared before his
eyes.  Jules coughed.  With all his light-heartedness he was an observant and wonderfully sympathetic
fellow, particularly where Henri was concerned, and now had double reason for showing him attention.
Putting his arm round Henri's waist, he supported him for a while.

"Pull yourself together, Henri," he said, "for we've got to go on in a little while and trap
that beggar.  What's he up to?  Some dirty game, you may be sure.  For he's a German, don't
forget, and don't forget, either, what Stuart would have said----"

"Stuart!" gurgled Henri, trying to laugh.  "That good fellow!  Stuart?"

"A splendid beggar!" agreed Jules.  "He'd have said, bluntly enough, that every German was
a dirty beggar, wouldn't he?"

Henri chortled.  Somehow or other Jules had a wonderful way of stirring up his old friend,
of "bucking him up", to use a slang expression; and now, just the mention of the gallant Stuart,
that very breezy, hefty Englishman, fixed Henri's wandering thoughts for a moment on a far
more pleasant subject, and seemed to help to steady his reeling brain, and first set him giggling
and then laughing merrily.

"You'll think I'm an old woman," he told Jules at last, shaking himself like a dog.

"Indeed!  Like an old woman?  Well, now, old women don't usually fight terrific combats at
the top of a stone stairway, and finally tumble headlong down that same stairway locked in
the arms of a German. Polite old women don't do their utmost to strangle the subjects of the
Kaiser; now do they, Henri?  And, besides--of course this is only a very small matter--such
old women as you have mentioned don't, when they've got a chance to escape the notice of such
sinister gentlemen as we have been associating with lately--I mean that Max beggar and his
Brandenburg fellows, who would shoot a helpless prisoner--such old bodies don't as a rule,
mind you, get hold of a bomb and sling it amongst them.

"It was fine--fine!" Jules told his chum, stretching out a hand and gripping Henri's energetically.

"Oh, rot!" Henri contrived to stutter.  He was getting quite indignant now.  "What utter nonsense
you are talking!  As if any old woman would fight a German!"

"Just so!  That's why I retorted when you asked me if, or rather suggested that, I thought
that you were one."

"Look here!" began Henri, quite nettled, and becoming increasingly impatient, whereat Jules
grinned.  Indeed, it was his turn to be amused, for intuitively in the darkness he had guessed
at Henri's condition; and knowing already how shaken he was, how nearly on the verge of unconsciousness,
he had racked his brain for some method which might revive him.  Stimulants, water, food, things
of that sort, were out of the question; words alone could be employed, and somehow the clever
Jules had contrived to pick the proper subject.  The mention of Stuart, then, had helped to
revive his friend; and now mention of Henri's gallantry had made the owner of that name quite
indignant.

"Utter rot!" shouted Henri again; "as if slinging a bomb was dangerous; and as if----"

"There's one thing you can't deny," said Jules; "it saved my life, as it was designed to do,
and I've not forgotten.  But how d'you feel? Better, eh?  Don't forget that we've lost sight
of that German."

As if Henri had ever forgotten it since he had seen the lithe, cunning figure of the Brandenburger
creeping in front of him.  True, in that curious state in which he had been--a state bordering
on unconsciousness--he had hardly been able to appreciate at times the significance of the
German's presence; but now he had wakened fully to its importance.

"Jingo," he told Jules as they squatted there in the darkness, "we must find the beggar!  He's
armed, without a doubt; and, worse than all, he's behind our fellows, for they've gone forward
into the fort. What's to prevent him shooting 'em in the back?  What's to prevent him carrying
on any sort of vileness?  We've got to follow at once, and, by hook or by crook, we've got
to capture or kill the beggar."

"Whichever you like--either will suit me," Jules responded; "and in any case, if he's caught,
it'll come to the same thing.  Once we've marched him back behind our lines, and handed him
over as a prisoner, he'll be shot, my boy.  We can prove that he would have deliberately shot
a prisoner; so it seems to me that, if we meet the gentleman, the best thing will be to end
the matter promptly.  But we've got to find him first, and perhaps he'll have something to
say when it comes to a question of shooting."

Max, that sinister Brandenburger officer, was indeed likely enough to have a considerable amount
to say in the question of his own disposal. Prognostication was not probable crown. But i closed she was

My enrollee was a Marquess.
  It would mean death to every man there; death to many of those outside;
and might easily break down the work already done by those gallant Frenchmen, and enable the
Brandenburgers to push on again into the fort and eject them.  Even Henri and Jules might not
escape unscathed, and Max, too, might be injured.  It was, indeed, a moment for action, for
swift decisive action, and, though Henri had felt rooted to the spot a moment before, any hesitation
there might have been was gone in an instant.  His whirling brain cleared, as it were, as need
for swift movement came, and, at once bounding forward, he gripped the German by the nape of
his neck and seized the hand which was lifting the bag upwards.

And then commenced a struggle in that gallery, for, to do him credit, as we have already done
indeed, this German was a tenacious fighter. Making frantic efforts to throw off Jules and
Henri, and to toss the bag into the room below, he staggered about the gallery with the two
Frenchmen hanging to him, and then, of a sudden breaking loose, he dashed away from them. 
It looked, indeed, as though he would make good his escape; but Jules raced after him, while
Henri dipped his hand in the bag before he moved, and then went rushing down the gallery, shouting
for the German to stop and deliver himself up as a prisoner.

A sharp crack, a flash in the darkness ahead of them, and the fleeting vision of a man pointing
a revolver at them followed, and then a swift movement of Henri's hand.  Bringing it back over
his shoulder he suddenly jerked the grenade forward, and hurled it at the German, the flash
which followed lighting up the gallery from end to end, while the blast of the explosion drove
the two Frenchmen backward.  As for Max, that sinister German who seemed to have dogged their
footsteps from the very commencement, from the days, indeed, when they were helpless prisoners
in Ruhleben, the bomb made short work of him--just as short work as it would have made of those
gallant Bretons.  He was dead! Hoist, indeed, by his own petard!

"And one isn't sorry!" Henri said, as the two of them returned and descended the stairs to
join the Bretons.  "I'd sooner kill a roomful of Germans than that one Frenchman should be
hurt.  And here, all that we've done is to reverse the numbers. Sidesplitter like a female, over
git frightened! "" Wal! wal! say no more about it! "when he hadn't
got scare, and make a fool in themselves, shout fire,'twouldn'them
have been happened!" repay Côte. ducklow something.

Engineering
to corner, and i shall be mortify closer of death.

No need to follow them back to that ambulance, nor to tell how those two gallant young Frenchmen,
now corporals, were soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant when they returned to their regiment,
and for weeks and weeks saw fighting along the Verdun salient. It is out consequence gluttony
which eat out vitality shall well. It is our unbridled appetites and hands what hold us did have
been of fleet in his soldiers. It is our stimulus saps that did the strength and yield energy.


The ruthless War Lord who caused this terrific contest to break out, who has deluged Europe
and Asia and Africa with blood, and who has been instrumental in the slaughter of hosts of
people, is still thwarted. True, he has gained certain yards of land--French land--the steep,
sloping sides of that plateau of Douaumont, and the lower ground opposite the Mort Homme and
Hill 304.  But at what a price!  The slopes are thick with dead Germans.  Returning again and
again to the attack, hounded on by their War Lord, German soldiers still advance over fields
carpeted with their fallen comrades; and still French guns and gallant French poilus smile
grimly down at them, as if to say:

"Come!  Come on!  Here is Verdun behind us.  There is yet land to sell between these trenches
and the city.  Come, then!  We will sell that land at a price as heavy, nay, heavier, than
that which you have already paid.  Come!  But only so far!  For Verdun is ours, and shall remain
so always."
